0,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on the Q3 2021 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is. being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.JeanJacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call presenting the results. of Hannover Re for the first nine months of this year. As usual, I'll start with an overview. before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the financials in more detail. And then, I. will comment on the outlook for this year and for 2022. For the Q&A, as always, I'm. additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.. In the first nine months of this year, Hannover Re has again proved its resilience in a. challenging market environment in life and health reinsurance. The results continued to be. impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And in P&C reinsurance, we had to deal with the. elevated large losses from natural catastrophes, most prominently the European floods. and Hurricane Ida in the third quarter.. The fact that we still achieved a double-digit return on equity, year-to-date highlights the. strong underlying profitability of the group and our successful volatility management.. Additionally, the group net income of EUR856 million is in line with our full year target. range of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25 billion, and hence, we have kept our profit guidance. unchanged.. Gross premium increased by 14.4% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by. our P&C business group, where we recorded continued strong top line growth on the. back of improving market conditions and increased demand from our clients, although. growth in life and health reinsurance was also ahead of our expectations.. In P&C reinsurance, the large loss impact of more than EUR1 billion was clearly above our. budget for the first nine months. Adjusted for this quarterly budget overrun, the technical. profitability was, however, in line with our expectations.. Furthermore, this is supported by our unchanged net estimate of COVID-19 related. losses, which has now been stable since the end of 2020 at EUR950 million. As. mentioned, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a significant impact in life and. health reinsurance. Within our portfolio, the main markets affected by COVID-related. excess mortality of the U.S., but also South Africa, where Hannover Re has a very strong. market position.. All-in-all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR404 million and most notably. the third quarter losses of around EUR140 million, came ahead of our initial expectation.. As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio led to a. positive one-off effect of EUR129 million. Additionally, we recorded a positive effect of. EUR99 million from reserve releases in the longevity in Q3, partly mitigating the COVID-19. impact.. At 2.9%, the return on investment is significantly ahead of our expectations, mainly driven. by favorable ordinary income. Our capitalization according to Solvency II continued to be. excellent confirmed by our strong solvency ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter,. well above our 200% threshold. The main reason for the decrease in the third quarter is. the increase in required capital due to the attractive business growth, including the growth. we expect to see in 2022. This leads to an increase in SCR, whereas the positive impact. on own funds is less immediate due to our conservative assumptions for new business.. Furthermore, large losses in P&C and COVID losses in life and health, had a negative. impact on the solvency ratio year-to-date.. The operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2021 reached a record high of EUR4.2. billion, mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results on. the investment side. The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from the. restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio of EUR640 million.. Overall, the positive cash flow fueled the strong growth in assets under own. management to an all-time high of about EUR55 billion. This growth was additionally. supported by ForEx effects and the issuance of EUR750 million in hybrid capital, already. known in March. This bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total. hybrid capital to EUR3 billion. Despite this issuance, we still have material flexibility in. regard to our total hybrid capacity. On the right-hand side, you can see that our strong. profitability is the main reason for the increase in shareholders' equity. And additionally,. the change in OCI was slightly positive, because negative valuation effect were offset by. positive currency translation.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques and good morning, everyone. I would dive straight into the. reporting for our business groups and start with P&C. We now look back at all important. renewal dates in 2021. And you can see gross and net premium in P&C reinsurance grew. by a remarkable 18% adjusted for currency effect.. The growth is highly diversified with particularly strong momentum in North America, in. Germany, and in Southeast Asia. On top of this, we successfully expanded our structured. reinsurance book, and we also were able to increase the volume of our facultative. reinsurance book. As in previous years, we would expect the growth in gross premium to. slow down somewhat; however, the net premium growth should remain more stable.. As you all know, the impact from large losses was significant in the third quarter of 2021.. For Hannover Re, this resulted in net large losses of EUR1.07 billion for the first nine. months, clearly above our budget of EUR849 million for the first nine months. The net loss. estimate for COVID-19 related losses, however, remained unchanged at EUR950 million.. All together, the combined ratio of 97.9% for the first nine months is very solid, in light of. the observed loss activity and the underlying figures are in line with our targets.. Net investment income in P&C increased based on strong ordinary income, higher. realized gains, and lower impairments. Other income and expenses include negative. currency effects of EUR105 million. In the previous year, we had almost the same amount. as a positive contribution, and I alluded to that already in the second quarter, that it is. mainly an accounting mismatch as we have a similar movement in our equity. All together,. the EBIT increased strongly to EUR161 million, thanks to the improved investment results. and the favorable underwriting result, which had been heavily impacted by COVID losses. in the previous year. Finally, the tax ratio is at normal level.. On the next slide, as mentioned, total net large losses accounted for EUR1.07 billion,. that's EUR221 million above budget. This means that we have already almost reached the. level of EUR1.1 billion budgeted for the full year after the first nine months. Of course, the. year-to-date budget overall is absorbed in the Q3 result, and hence the EUR251 million. budgeted for Q3 -- for Q4, are still available.. On the next slide, looking at our large losses, the two largest events were unsurprisingly. the European floods with a net loss of EUR214 million and Hurricane Ida with EUR306. million net for our account. On top of this, we have seen further increases in the loss. estimates for storm Volker and the Texas freeze on the NatCat side. However, man-made. losses also increased by slightly more than EUR100 million in Q3, almost entirely due to. the riots in South Africa, which are included in the property losses with an amount of. EUR94 million. Altogether, the impact from both NatCat and man-made losses was. significant in Q3, pushing the actual loss experience above the budget for the first nine. months.. The next slide, as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting. line. The picture I'd say very much reflects the large loss situation. I've just explained,. combined ratios for EMEA, affected by the European floods and by the riots in South. Africa, while the Americas include significant losses from Hurricane Ida and the Texas. freeze.. The worldwide markets show a rather mixed picture. Facultative and agricultural business. are mainly impacted by large losses in the technical profitability and credit and surety, as. well as in aviation and marine, is really excellent driven by favorable underlying loss. development and positive reserve runoff.. Let's move on to life and health, then on the next slide. The pleasing business growth is. reflected in both the premium and in value of new business. And really, I'd say, comes. from all our four important categories. Growth is actually quite diversified by region as. well. As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the technical result was still affected by losses in. connection with COVID-19. Around 85% of the losses stemmed from two markets, EUR197. million from the U.S. and EUR149 million from South Africa. The losses in South Africa were. particularly significant in the third quarter, whereas the losses from the U.S. were lower. than in previous quarters.. On the positive side, we recorded a positive effect of EUR99 million from reserve. releases for our longevity portfolio. In part to really avoid misunderstandings, I think this. needs some additional explanation. You might be wondering how we can have further. reserve releases when we have locked in assumptions according to address for. accounting and usually, we do not even have to set up reserves for this kind of treaties.. The reason is that we have so-called provisions for adverse developments and as Claude. already explained at our Investors Day, not long ago in recent months, we have received. updated mortality data from our clients, showing that the mortality within our enforce. portfolio has been higher than expected.. Hence, we could release those provisions for adverse developments those had, because. more people in our portfolio have actually died than initially assumed, not because we. assume any different mortality trends for the future.. In other words, the impact does not reflect any general change in assumptions for our. longevity business, which would be uncertain, but only higher mortality in the enforce. book, which of course is completely certain.. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the updated mortality data is largely for preCOVID period and not affected by the pandemic.. Finally, as explained in our Q1 conference call, the restructuring of parts of the ING. portfolio in U.S. mortality led to a positive one-off effect affecting various lines items in the. P&L. In total, the positive impact was EUR129 million. The ordinary investment income was. in line with expectations. The fair value of financial instruments decreased materially. The. negative impact was driven by the valuation of derivative embedded in a life reinsurance. contract in the UK. And additionally, the previous year had benefited from positive. valuation gains from an equity participation.. Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution from. our Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which is recognized according to the. deposit accounting method. Currency effect here in line and has had a rather minor. impact. Altogether, the EBIT of EUR220 million is satisfactory, reflecting the. aforementioned positive and negative extraordinary effects.. On the next slide, as usual, a quick look at the non-IFRS metric for business growth in life. and health, the value of new business according to Solvency II. In Q3, we again took. advantage of the attractive opportunities for financial solutions in the U.S., but also in. China and we further expanded our longevity book in the UK. The total value of new. business for the first nine months supports our full year minimum target of EUR250. million. Furthermore, the pipeline currently looks very promising, and I would say we are. well on track in terms of new business production.. On the next slide, the development of our investments. I think it's fair to say that the. development in the first quarter and in the first nine months of the year was very. satisfactory. The ordinary investment income is particularly strong. The main drivers for this. development are the excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Then the. overall asset growth fueled by our very positive cash flow as well as the impact from. increased actual inflation numbers and the associated positive impact on the amortization. of our inflation linked bond.. Realized gains have also increased compared to last year and are mainly the result of. routine portfolio management as well as some strategic -- let's say, as we mentioned the. sale of listed equities in the first quarter, which have contributed EUR50 million to the. realized gains. Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous year,. where we had recorded some impairments in the more volatile market environment. So,. this year's number is more or less at expected low levels to a large extent comprising. regular depreciation on our real estate portfolio.. As explained in my comments on life and health, derivative valuation was negative. So, the. overall return on investment was 2.9% and we expect to achieve a higher return than our. initial full year expectation of roughly 2.4%.. Unrealized gains, as you can see here, decreased by around EUR500 million, mainly due. to the increase in interest rates that are compared to year-end 2020.. On the next slide, well known, I think the asset allocation developed in line with our. strategy. The most notable change is the reallocation from government bonds into. corporate bonds. The focus here is on large and small corporates in developed markets.. The contributions to ordinary investments income is diversified as usual. The highlight as. mentioned is probably the recovery in the contribution from private equity to the strong. levels we had seen before the market volatility, caused by the pandemic.. To conclude my remarks, the first nine months and in particularly, the third quarter proved. to be a challenging period for the reinsurance industry, and therefore, the overall result. and the fact that we have confirmed our full year profit guidance for 2021 highlights. Hannover Re's strong ability to manage and absorb volatility.. On that note, I'd hand back to you Jean-Jacques for the comments on the outlook.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, Clemens. On the next slide, the target metrics confirms Clemens'. summary. Most notably, our main profitability target for the group, the return on equity is. well above our minimum target, even though the underwriting results in both P&C and life. and health are impacted by extraordinary losses. This also means that the EBIT growth. targets in P&C and life and health are somewhat distorted by COVID claims. These. targets being more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the strategic. cycle.. More importantly, growth is significantly ahead of the strategic target, providing a strong. basis for a successful business development in 2022.. So, before we move on to the outlook for next year, let's have a brief look at our. guidance for the year 2021. As mentioned, the profit guidance remains unchanged.. Thinking about the individual components contributing to this number, the premium. growth is stronger than initially expected, and together with a higher return on. investment, this should be sufficient to compensate for higher-than-expected large losses. in P&C and higher-than-expected COVID losses in life and health, which were also partly. offset by positive one-off effect as we've seen.. For the fourth quarter, further impacts from COVID claims is likely in life and health. Even. though the development of the pandemic remains uncertain, the accelerating vaccination. progress in South Africa in particular provides the basis for decreasing excess mortality in. this country. The targeted ordinary dividend according to our new definition as. communicated at our Investors Day is at least the EUR4.5 paid out this year. As before, we. will consider paying a special dividend on top of this if the capitalization exceeds our. capital requirements for future growth and profit targets are achieved. And as of today,. I'd say that both sides of trend are being met.. As usual, at this time of the year, we publish our guidance for the expectations for next. year, as mentioned, growth opportunities are attractive, and we therefore, expect gross. return premium to increase by at least 5%. As in previous years, the growth is likely to be. more pronounced in P&C reinsurance. The return on investment should be at least 2.3%,. the 10 basis points being -- decrease being -- versus our initial guidance for this year,. reflecting the low interest rate environment with reinvestment deals below our portfolio. yield.. The group net income is expected to be within the range of EUR1.4 billion to EUR1.5. billion, an underlying improvement of around EUR250 million compared to our guidance. for this year. The main driver for the improvement is the profitable growth in this and. previous years, in particular in P&C reinsurance. And this growth is not only leading to an. improved underwriting result, it has additionally led to a very positive cash flow, which in. turn forms the basis for the favorable growth in assets under own management. And the. increased asset base is expected to more than compensate for the slight reduction in. relative returns.. In life and health, growth is similarly helpful, but the profitability is also expected to. improve. The uncertainty in life and health is somewhat higher due to the future. development of the COVID-19 pandemic. And with this in mind, we have added a. disclaimer to the effect that no material COVID lost is -- are included in the guidance.. In addition, we have not included any potential relief from our mortality rate for cover,. which is likely to payout in 2022. So, there is some allowance for COVID claims embedded. in our guidance, but no significant numbers.. Apart from this, the guidance is under the usual provisor the large losses stayed within the. budget in P&C. And the budget has increased to EUR1.3 billion. And of course, also that. there are no major distortions in the capital market. The increased large loss budget is. mainly a reflection of business growth. Last but not least, the dividend policy is the same. as -- for this year. The ordinary dividend announced in March 2022 will be our floor for the. ordinary dividend and we have a potential special dividend on top. Altogether, our. guidance reflects the positive development and successful cycle management of the. group and we're quite positive about the outlook for next year.. This concludes my remarks. And as always, we would be happy to answer your questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Question And Answer). Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) And the first question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Your line is now. open. Please go ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased cat. budget for 2022, the EUR1.3 billion. Because you split that between man-made and. NatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21. I guess I'm just. curious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growth. or is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talk. about it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volume. versus anything else going on?. My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color. I'm. just trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, before. we'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to update. again unreleased further PADs. If there's something, it could be that much of a gap. between when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flow. from cedents. Thanks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address the. longevity release.. Sven Althoff. Yes. With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versus. NatCat. So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021.. So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1.3 billion is manmade and EUR1.050 billion is the natural catastrophe. The growth is not a proxy for our. premium growth ambitions for next year. As always, it is the mix between the growth we. have seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our major. loss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipated. growth we expect for next year.. The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related. There's only a smaller. portion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we are. validating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three to. four years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of that. is flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022.. Klaus Miller. Okay. Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side. The way how it works as. we -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pension. insurer. And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at the. forefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting.. So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do that. and they have to change their systems to administer that. And that takes usually at least a. year, sometimes two, sometimes even more.. We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible). and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we get. at least annual update. Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes we. have to ask for it. So, a delay of two years is probably the norm.. And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixed. lag, which is fixed from the outset. We know exactly these numbers. They don't even have. to send it to us. And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have to. pay. And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag. We know that. the treaty is basically going according to plan. And then, we just book these numbers.. What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,. if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same as. somebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000. So, in the monthly. accounts, you don't see a difference. But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot of. these claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher than. if somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,. much shorter.. And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especially. writing new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the. (inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start getting this up to. date and again this year. And you can expect this for the future. If we don't update the. (inaudible) and release the PADs as Clemens mentioned earlier, you should expect our. profits are improving from year-to-year in small -- very small set. And then only as soon as. we take the (inaudible) and clean up for the people who have died more than expected.. And obviously, we can release all the provisions for adverse deviations for these dead. people because we definitely don't need it. Then you will see a big profit like you see this. year. This should happen regularly every two or three years.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible). Andrew Ritchie. Sure.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. -- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest. So,. there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount that. we've seen this year.. Klaus Miller. But just to make one point clear, this is not a new assumption setting for mortality in the. future. This is cleaning up the portfolio for people who have died. And therefore, clearly,. Andrew Ritchie. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Hey, good morning. Thank you very much. So, a few questions please if I can. First is that,. I'm noticing, I mean, you're talking about Solvency FTR growth, but I can't seem to. recollect that, it was there, for example, similar period last year, might have been, but we. didn't really mention it. The growth was similar. So, I just wanted to know, is there anything. more remarkable in that number? And this is more a quick check really.. Second question is on the combined ratios in credit. I think I can back calculate 3Q is about. 73%. Now, remember that we keep talking about how the economic recovery and. insolvency in state schemes going away. Is there any reserve movement here or anything. more notable please?. Just one more question on retro please. The bond recovery is very, very high. I mean 240. net growth, 643, I think is one of the very strong recoveries for a single loss. Could you. comment on that? With also some comments please on Texas freeze?. And just lastly, please, the cash flow of EUR1.5 billion is very, very high, very high as far as. me. You mentioned investment income, the roads and the business, but is there anything. more remarkable, for instance, I mean, there would also be payouts to be made on these. EUR1 billion plus of losses. Would that be affecting cash flows in the future as well? So, I. just wanted to understand the cash flow well? Thank you very much.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Vinit. So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status and. credit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes, Vinit. Good morning. Let's start with the Solvency I. So, it's really as Jean-Jacques. mentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all. So, if we. would be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on the. basis of Q2 of 250 roughly. So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily. It's the usual. exercise that we do in Q3.. First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growth. that we've seen in this year. But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle for. the next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected new. business both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reason. why the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio. Again, it's the. usual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as we. speak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually.. And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, in. Q4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4. What is probably also worth. mentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to a. increase. But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at our. new business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then in. the next quarter.. Unidentified Speaker. On the cash flow, nothing really significant. I mean, Jean-Jacques mentioned, for example,. the Q1 effects from Voya and, of course, the bond issuance, et cetera, but in Q3, it's really. the business in flow. And I think what is probably worth mentioning here, when it is the fact. that we have seen very low payout ratios when it comes to our plane. I think that's. probably the main driver, that the cash outflows for large losses has been lower than I. would have expected. I hope that answers the questions, Vinit.. Vinit Malhotra. Yeah. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. The credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positive. runoff from old underwriting years. We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level of. insolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runoff. for the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that we. now had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus. So, the short-term. level of insolvencies were below our original assumptions.. And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long. So, three to five years, we could. now release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years.. When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and the. net is relatively high. This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both our. transactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, which. explains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, the. bulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually the. difference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting. So, EUR180 million out of. recoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position. And on the. winter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoff. freeze loss. So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting and. reporting periods. We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we should. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thanks, Sven.. Operator. The next question is from William Hardcastle, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. William Hardcastle. Hi, morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on that. So, essentially on the fronting. business, is what you're saying the difference between the gross and net, obviously on. the floods is bigger versus Ida. Is that because of the greater fronting on European. business? Is that what you're saying?. Klaus Miller. No. Not at all. That's not what I was saying or trying to say at least. When it comes to the. German business, we hardly do any fronting. So, the difference on burnt between gross. and net, is really our own retro sessions. So, the gross number you are seeing is also. almost exclusively our own writing. that situation is different on an Ida. The U.S. portfolio is. the peak portfolio in our fronting activities. So, therefore out of the EUR527 million of. gross, approximately EUR180 million is fronted business, where -- while on burnt, it is. almost zero.. William Hardcastle. Sure. It's quite the opposite of what I was saying. So, effectively your retro is kicking far. stronger in your own account from the floods than has on Ida. Is there anything why that's. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, it's a question of market share. Given that our subsidiary for the German business,. the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business. Our. market share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but also. the NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the United. States, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight.. William Hardcastle. Okay. Moving to (inaudible) I'll go to my actual questions now. What benefit did the. reinstatement premium have in Q3 for P&C? And is this already factored in when you. provide the 2022 outlook, to say greater than 5%? And perhaps any quantification of what. that impact is?. And the second one is, you've touched on there on the 2022 guidance, no material. COVID-19 impact in life and health. Just for clarity, it sounds like you're not assuming zero,. but certainly less than something like EUR100 million. Is that a very fair assumption?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking those. reinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effect. into 2022 from reinstatement premiums. I don't have any precise numbers for you on how. high exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were. So, rather. than speculating, I guess we will have to come back to you on that.. Unidentified Speaker. On COVID, life and health, William, I think your assumption is right. We have built in some. expectation in our 2022 guidance for COVID related claims. It's not going to be a tripledigit number. It's somewhere a double-digit number I think that we've baked in. On top of. that though, we still have the potential coverage from our retro pandemic cover in life and. health, that will be most likely paid out in 2022. So, that will give us an additional buffer for. the year. But as Jean-Jacques mentioned, it shouldn't -- should not significantly deviate. from those numbers.. William Hardcastle. And just on that pandemic retro cover, it sounds like you feel very confident that will pay. out now, is that because Q3 losses for excess mortality came in ahead of your. expectation, that it's effectively giving greater certainty that it will kick in. Is that how we. should read that?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. That's absolutely correct. Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to our. own calculation. From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will do. the calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021. So. that will take some time in 2022 before this information is available. But according to our. own calculation, we are getting close to 113% now.. Unidentified Speaker. Just for clarity, when the coverage is, it's a parametric trigger and the coverage is U.S.,. Australia, and U.K. So, it's not South Africa.. William Hardcastle. Brilliant. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. The first one would be related to the walk from. the '22 guidance versus 2021. If you could add maybe a bit of color on the underlying. assumptions you have taken? The second quick question will be, regarding COVID. scenario for 2022, I guess that you built something in into your 239% Solvency II ratio. already, given it's forward-looking in terms of calculation. So, would you mind saying. maybe a range of what you're already expecting for 2022?. And so, the last question would be, just to come back on the 2.3% return on investment. guidance for 2022, and especially knowing that you reported 2.9% or 2.8% ordinary. investment income in 2021. I mean, you've got the support from private equity from. inflation linkers, but I'm wondering either 2.3% should be -- if nothing exceptionally is in. the reported nine months 2021, I'm wondering, is the 2.3% should be compared to the. 2.4% 2020 guidance or to the 2.8% 2021, and 2.3% seems to be super, super cautious,. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thomas, let's probably start with the guidance for 2022. So, overall, I think without. income mainly stem from. It's clearly a mix of effect. In the bottom line, first of all, of. course, the significant business growth that we've seen both in P&C -- in life and health. and in P&C, the quality of the book should have increased over the last couple of years.. So, we will certainly increase -- we'll see an increase of profitability and in P&C here and. there. And of course, the overall amount of the growth will be reflected in higher EBIT. numbers in P&C. On the life and health book, as mentioned earlier, the expectation is that. we will see significant less COVID-19 claims in the life and health segment. So, the. underlying profitability of the business should come through in 2022. That will be another. large contributor.. On the investment side, I think, yes, when you look at the numbers, they do seem very. cautious for 2022. We are optimistic that we will at least reach that number, the 2.3%, but. I'm just conscious of the fact, of course, that we've seen sort of a rebound in the. contribution from alternative investment, that amount has been significant. I think roughly. EUR100 million of our ordinary income is only related to an increase compared to last year. of the contribution of alternative investments, mainly private equity. So, I wouldn't really. factor that in going forward for every year. I think that did come a bit as a surprise for me,. to be honest, also the valuations on the private equity side, which have increased. significantly. So, I wouldn't really want to expect that amount for 2022.. Inflation-linked bonds, the same picture there. We have seen a huge contribution,. probably EUR100 million more this year as well, compared to last year, given the current. inflation environment and the way the amortization of our inflation-linked bonds work. So,. there are two -- at least two effects in the ordinary already, that we will see to some. extent in next year, but we have been a bit more cautious on that end.. On Solvency II, if I got the question right, Thomas, but please add. So, how much from the. SCR increase would we attribute to our growth in 2022? I don't have the exact number.. But I think overall, it's certainly on the Solvency II ratio, probably a double digit -- low. double-digit number, or a high single-digit, a low double-digit number that is attributable. to that effect. But again --. Thomas Fossard. Yes. I think, Clemens, I was more thinking about the prospective COVID-19 mortality. losses that you are expecting to incur in 2022, which may already be reflected into your. Solvency II ratio at Q3.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. No, that is not -- I don't think that is included in the SCR and in the own funds yet. We. will do an update of that planning and the effect I think in the fourth quarter, but it's not. reflected. But it wouldn't be in a substantial amount as mentioned earlier anyways.. Thomas Fossard. Yes.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Sorry, Thomas.. Operator. The next question is from Iain Pearce, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Iain Pearce. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the growth numbers. When we. look at the impact on the Solvency II ratio and the increase in the cat budget, the. implication is probably that growth is going to be significantly ahead of 5% especially in. And then secondly, is there anything in terms of life and health growth that you're thinking. is going to be lower, that's leading you to maintain that 5% growth target? The second. one was just a quick clarification, the life retro kicks in, is it a 100% excess of normal. mortality that the trigger for that parametric cover?. And then, the third one was just on longevity releases and the potential for these going. forward. Sort of -- you sort of cautioned us against factoring in too much here, but if you. think -- if I thinking in sort of your key longevity markets, mortality has been trending. favorably consistently over the last couple of years before we even factor in any impacts. from COVID. Why should we not be thinking that these are going to be some -- there's. going to be continued favorable longevity development?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth in. P&C, Sven you can add there again.. Klaus Miller. Okay. Let's start with the growth on the life and health side. We are quite optimistic that. we are growing, but most of that will be -- and this is where our focus is on the bottom. line, it's not on the top line. Top line happened every now and then, and you have to. understand there are basically three ways to grow the top line here.. On the -- either we really write new large blocks of business, that will increase top line or. most of our treaties on the mortality side -- morbidity side are via treaties, and as these. treaties get older, that mortality rates, morbidity rates grow exponentially. So, the risk. premium grows, even if nothing happens, even if no new policies are added, these. treaties grow for the existing portfolio, because we have risk premiums, which are. growing.. Of course, at some point in time, this goes the other way, because in 50 years all these. treaties have runoff. But as long as they are still young, 10, 15, sorry -- 10, 15 years old.. These treaties are growing. And then, of course, we have treaties, which are open for. new business, and this is another source of growth. So, in general, we expect to reach the. 5% maybe a little bit more, but this mainly depends on large block transactions, especially. on one of our focus areas. And that is longevity.. Then your question on the retro, yes, it kicks in at 110% population mortality. And that is. the, as mentioned earlier by Clemens, it's a weighted average of the U.S., UK, and. Australian population mortality, weighted with the portfolio of Hannover Re.. So, we try to get the correlation between this parametric cover and the results in our own. portfolio as high as possible. So, we tried to optimize that by using our own portfolio. structure to define the parametric cover. And as I said earlier, it's currently stands close to. 113%, according to our own calculations.. And then, the longevity release, yes, we are, when we started 15, 20 years ago, we have. longevity and nobody else was doing that. We embarked on a pretty conservative way of. accounting for that. So, in the first couple of years and this is still valid today, we only show. about 2% to 3% profit in terms of an EBIT margin. And if the portfolio develops as. expected, we would see and you've seen that now a release of these PADs especially. when we do these cleanup of portfolio. With COVID, especially in the U.K., we got the -U.K. is the largest market, we had a lot of claims and most of these claims have not been. accounted for fully, because the release you have seen probably only includes the. updated portfolio information 12 months ago. So, an awful lot of COVID is still not in there.. That is something what we hope to release sometime in the future as soon as we know. that we have valid data for that from the clients.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. On P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?. Sven Althoff. Yes. As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for our. expected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year. From a process point. of view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like we. are doing now. So, the EUR1.3 billion is fixed for 2022. Same, of course, goes for the EUR1.1. billion we fixed for 2021. And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect a. premium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were more. expecting a growth in the 5% to 7.5% range. So, a good part of the increase in the major. loss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in. 2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022.. As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%. on the P&C side. But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average I. gave you during the Investors Day, i.e., the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeks. ago, rather than the 14% after three quarters. By the way, the growth number will come. slightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the full. year. The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset on. our biggest structured contract, we have increased our share. So, there was a significant. premium entry booked in the third quarter. But under that contract, we every year too. have the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there will. be a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on that. particular contract. And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%. rather than staying at the 14.5%, where we are after three quarters.. Iain Pearce. Perfect. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Darius Satkauskas of KBW. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Darius Satkauskas. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, your Solvency II ratio have declined. 11 percentage points since the end of July. Could you tell us how many Solvency II points. did the expected growth account for? And then, is this capturing the next 12 months? So,. the 4Q 2022 as well or -- sorry, is it capturing the next 12 months or the entire 2022?. And then lastly, do you have a comparable figure for last year, because if I look at the. Solvency II decline in 3Q 2020 relative to 1H '20, it's much less pronounced. So, yes, could. you give us a comparable figure if possible? Thank you.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. On Solvency II, it's actually the business growth that we've seen in 2021, that is. reflected. So, we've updated our model for the current business growth, which has been. significant so far and also it includes the full 12 months of 2022. So, that's really the usual. planning cycle that we complete in Q3, and then we include that in our SCR calculation for. the full year 2022, so that's the new business both in P&C and in life and health. So that. increases -- and then, of course, the higher capacities here and there in P&C and life and. health. So that's the main driver.. I don't have the exact number, but it's going to be a double-digit number, which has been. offset by some other effects, but I think it's about a double-digit number here. And again,. another contributor was, of course, the asset risk due to our slightly changed asset. allocation and the increase in alternative investments as mentioned earlier. That was. another contributor.. Darius Satkauskas. Thank you.. Operator. And we have a follow-up question from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. again.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. Sorry to ask again, but on the life side, I mean, I'm just. curious about a few things please.. One is that, if I just start with the operated -- the reported EBIT of EUR41 million, and add. back COVID mortality data, the longevity is at EUR83 million. And then somewhere from. the presentation, I picked up that financials -- the deposit accounting was also EUR95. million. So, ex deposit accounting, we actually have a loss of about EUR12 million. And I've. been made aware that there are some derivatives which went up against in the financial -in the financial statement. I mean, is there anything that you could comment on this. surprisingly negative result on the life side, please? That's really my question.. And second question is, on this cover on the pandemic, I think there was a conversation. also in the 2Q results, where it was mentioned that the cover wasn't being activated yet,. because of Australian mortality trends, if I recollect. Has that changed? Or is there some. update on that, that makes you think that next year you could choose this cover?. And last follow-up is on getting a question from (inaudible) is there any idea to break out. this burned between (inaudible) and the whole account, please? Thank you.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Okay. The first question was the EBIT. I fully understand that you do a little bit of, let's say,. recalculation, take a few things out and add others back in, but the COVID reporting of. COVID claims is, let's say, at least very delayed, if not completely unreliable. So, making. calculations especially on the quarterly basis, what the usual number would be, it's quite. difficult. We don't get correct information from all our clients, and we definitely don't get it. in time. So, adding or subtracting COVID claims from, let's say, audited claims numbers is. -- it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I would not necessarily rely on the outcome here.. I can't see that we have a negative -- of course, we have a negative results if you look at. the COVID claims on mortality side, it's highly negative, but we have a very stable financial. solutions result. What you have seen in the other result here is the 351, of which 278 is. deposit accounting treaties and they are completely unaffected by COVID. We also have. very positive longevity result, plus even if you ignore the one-off of nearly EUR100 million,. which is also only slightly positive impacted by COVID. And the EUR400 million COVID. claims, of course, drag it down, but the underlying profitability is extremely high and. stable. The great unknown for us is how the next COVID variant will develop in '22. And. nobody can tell you anything about that.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Vinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which might. explain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of the. underlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and the. second quarter and less in the third quarter. But then on top of that, I think the investment. result on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainly. attributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book.. And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C. And then, we have the. mentioned derivative in the U.K. results and that is -- that was a deviation in the third. quarter of roughly EUR10 million. So overall, that should round up the picture probably.. Clemens Jungsthof el. But definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,. but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeks. and even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,. everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if that. has nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will be. reported as a COVID claim in many countries. That doesn't happen. So I don't really rely. on this analysis. Definitely not on a quarterly basis. And then, could you just repeat your. question on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?. Vinit Malhotra. As the life pandemic cover was already running at a higher and I think at 2Q, you had said. that you were not yet counting it in or factoring it because of Australian mortality claims.. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing. But maybe -- yes.. Clemens Jungsthof el. The cover is for all three countries in total. So, it's a parametric cover and this stands at. 100 and close to 113 right now. If nobody dies for the rest of the year, this will fall below. the 110 and we don't get anything. It's unlikely that we don't even see normal mortality. So,. I expect definitely something in -- for this year, but it will only be calculated next year,. because the calculation agent relies on official statistics and official statistics, population. statistics for 2021 will only be available sometime in 2022. And sometimes it's not January. or February or anything like that, well the second half of the year. These are civil servants. who produce that.. And the calculation agent will only start calculating the final recuperation for us here, as. soon as he has all the official statistics from the U.S., from Australia, from the U.K.. Vinit Malhotra. And the EUR32 million booked in the U.S. COVID 3Q, that looked a bit lower and that. could be also this late supporting, Klaus, that you mentioned?. Unidentified Speaker. Sorry --. Vinit Malhotra. That in the third quarter, the U.S. was rather low mortality in booking of EUR32 million. versus the deaths and the excess straight were nearly EUR100,000.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Vinit, sorry, I think -- apologies, Vinit. Go ahead.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million to. EUR80 million stemming out of South Africa. So that was the bulk. And I think, it's probably. a bit higher number than you assume for the U.S. actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,. wasn't it in life and health in the U.S.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.. Klaus Miller. Yes. On burned, Vinit, you know that we have placed a little over EUR300 million of whole. accounts coverage. So, you should think about burned in the terms of being a substantial. partial loss against our whole account cover. I would not be comfortable to give you the. precise split for the simple reason that the loss happened in the quarter.. So therefore, we have not received enough information yet to book each and every. element of the loss on the bottom-up basis. So, there are still some top-down. assumptions included in our gross number for burned. And depending on how that will fall. in the end on individual contracts, the split between K and whole account is subject to. change. So, whatever (inaudible) split, I would give you today, would be subject to that. change. So therefore, I would feel uncomfortable to giving you very precise numbers. But. as I said, you should think about burned as a substantial partial loss against our whole. account structure with the remainder going to K.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And we do have a follow-up from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your. line is now open again.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Two quick questions. The first one would be on the life reside, this longevity PAD. I. guess it was included in your EUR600 million EBIT contribution initially targeted for 2023. and that you move to 2024, but just wanted to -- I guess it was included at the time of the. Investor Day. But just wanted to update on that, just to be fully aligned and fully clear. And. the second question would be on the P&C side or P&C NatCat. What's your overall. assessment of the profitability of your book? Maybe you could share with us the year-todate combined ratio or the return on allocated capital you're getting on this book despite. running ahead of budget? Thank you.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thomas, this is indeed taking into account the longevity and benefits also that -that's including the EUR600 million.. Klaus Miller. And on the NatCat, so as Jean-Jacques explained in the Q&A, during the Investors Day, of. the NatCat portfolio is modeling well against our profitability hurdle rate. So, from pricing. point of view, the last two rounds of rate increases certainly helped to get that portfolio to. a better level of profitability. We expect further rate increases on the loss impacted. business into 2022. So, from that point of view, we are okay with our profitability on the. NatCat side, but at the same time, as we already mentioned on the Investors Day, we will. keep our relative risk appetite for NatCat stable nonetheless. We are not seeing rates. yet, which would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite.. On the result point of view, I'm afraid, I don't have those numbers for you. The NatCat is. not a separate segment we are reporting upon, as you know, for few quarters now. So, I. would not be able to give you those numbers, but Claude can get back to you on those.. Thomas Fossard. Thank you. Thank you.. Operator. And there are no further questions at this point. So, I hand back to the speakers for. closing remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much for joining, and thank you for the great questions. I think we. covered the ground very well. You've seen a year impacted by large losses on both. business segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, the. ROE above 10%. And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has been. confirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022. The guidance for '22 shows both. the growth trajectory of the company and the improved quality of the book. So, I think the. key messages were addressed today. Thank you very much for all the questions and see. you next time.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect.",20211104_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2021-11-4_RT000000002967437630.pdf,2021-11-04
1,"Well. Good morning to all of you. Welcome to Hannover Re's Investors' Day 2019. And I'm. really delighted that so many of you were able to take up our invitation. My name is Karl. Steinle. And I'm, among other things, responsible for Investor Relations and corporate. comms.. If we go by the Gregorian calendar, that 2019's edition of this event is the 22nd. And. some of you may refer to it as the first Investors Day in the post-Valen era or the first one. in the (onshore) era.. For me, personally, it's the 10th edition. And I must say I'm rather relieved that some of. you joining here today have experienced quite a few more than I have of these Hannover. Re Investor Days.. As you know, we are always very keen to find an attractive and inspiring location for the. Investors Day dinner, especially, partly as a means of encouraging the dialogue with. management. It is also a way to express our appreciation for the work that you do for. Hannover Re. And casting back our minds, we have been to the zoo, we have been in the. theater, various museums, even a vintage car collection or a crypt.. Given the importance of that, that we attach to that event, we have almost thrown our. cost target unceremoniously overboard in doing so. To make that even easier, this time,. the boat trip yesterday was a logical consequence.. As we head out on the -- on this voyage of discovery, it is, of course, only fitting that our. new captain and CEO, Jean-Jacques Henchoz will be taking the wheel. I would like to. express my gratitude to Catherine and Kathleen, who tracked down that marvelous. location yesterday and created this unforgettable atmosphere. Well thanks.. I hope -- I do hope that you found the captain's dinner yesterday, enjoyable and inspiring.. And not only because of the maritime theme. Our crews today will feature a number of. highlights. First off, Jean-Jacques will map out the future course to be chartered by our. Hannover Re power boat. And he will discuss the strategic initiatives that has been. launched since he took the helm.. Roland Vogel, our CFO, will explain how he navigates the stormy seas of the capital. markets and how he intends to sail around the low tide of current interest rates. Andreas,. our CRO, will assure us that from the reserving point of view, we have sufficient water. under the keel. And we -- he will discuss the capital generation and the Solvency II model. update.. Claude ChÃ¨vre will describe how we are conquering new markets in Asia, along with the. approaches and initiatives that we pursue to deliver added value to our customers. Klaus. Miller and Silke Sehm will additionally offer up a glimpse into the engine room of bespoke. solutions. Unfortunately, I have to excuse Sven Althoff because he cannot be here today. due to illness. But I'm sure he's the one of the many who have dialed in for the webcast.. And we send him our best wishes for recovery.. As you can see, we have a rich agenda for today. And before we start, I'd like to draw. your attention to the feedback question there, which is on your desk. And as you know,. we really appreciate and highly value your feedback because we use it extensively for, a,. conveying your comments and messages to the management; and B, preparing for the. upcoming activities.. You may either leave the feedback form at your desk or hand it over to Julia and her. team. As a gesture of gratitude and appreciation for your positive and unfailingly fair. cooperation, you will find a very modest gift on your table. I hope you will like it.. Well I don't want to keep your suspense any longer. So I'm now handing over to our CEO,. Jean-Jacques. The floor is yours.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Great pleasure to meet you for the first. time. Thank you, also for yesterday evening. This was a good opportunity to interact more. informally. It's a pleasure for me to be here for the first time after roughly six months in. the role. So still early days and still ideas and new inputs coming every week. So there will. be more to come.. Today, for me, it's an opportunity to take stock of where we stand as a company. strategically, competitively, give a very brief view of the track record of achievement. Then. introduce some of the ideas which are worked on by the team today.. These are several initiatives, which we're working on diligently, which will lead to some. strategy days in January with the Executive Board. Then in the New Year, we'll be able to. put together a strategy review for our next cycle, for '23.. So bear with me. Today is more about giving a sense of direction. There are many items. which need some fine-tuning, which need discussions within the team. So no quantum nor. any leap for today. But be aware that next year, we'll make sure we give you some more. granular input on these ideas and initiatives, particularly on where we see them in terms. of supporting our targets and put some numbers around them.. So as a brief review of the track record of outperformance. So that's the title of the. presentation, pursuing the outperformance journey. Ten years of superb track record in. terms of ROE, in particular. But growth as well and an opportunity for us to take stock and. think about the key success factors, which are needed to continue that journey of. outperformance.. So 3 topics I'd like to cover. Maybe the one before, just on the agenda slide, the current. position in the market. You know the numbers very well. I won't go into many, many. details. Secondly, the business model. Also, the business model, as I see it, the. comparison from the outside-in view and what I've seen in the past few months. And. lastly, a bit more of an outlook in some of these topics, which are on our mind.. So position in the market. I see the number 95. This has nothing to do with our combined. ratio. So don't jump to conclusion on this one. But a few slides just to wrap up on the. property and casualty side. These are slides you know already with an update. We have a. market, which has been growing 2.9% in the phase shown here 2014 to last year. The. growth of Hannover Re has been, on average, 9.4%.. You see a clear gain in terms of market share during that period. We moved from 6% at. the time in '14 to 8% last year. And I hate to say that the benchmarks on the economic. hurdles have been met. So it's not that we compromised on bottom line during that. period. It's very much profitable growth.. And I see the journey continuing on that one. Short term, I think we have some good. momentum. I've met a number of clients, who are very keen to continue to expand the. relationship with us. So I'm rather optimistic about continued profitable growth in P&C.. So just to give a bit the same view. But with the earnings, the EBIT contribution across. these years. The reinsurance market earnings since 2014 were rather volatile. If you take. the top players. But you see there our contribution has been steady. We have an EBIT. contribution in percentage terms, which vary considerably. But very steady in terms of. numbers.. And this, of course, particularly for '17 and '18 has to do with the heavy NatCat load and. the fact that we had very, very good retrocession protection and helped us to outperform. the market during these past two years in P&C. So that's certainly one of the insights that. I'm very convinced about the retro program and feel we need to continue based on that. approach.. So P&C continues to be stable and steady and growing. It's a very, very important. earnings contributor for us. And will continue to be so in the next few years.. Moving now on to life and health. You see a bit of a different picture in terms of market. share. We used to have 11%. There has been 3.9% market growth. We were a little bit. down and practically no growth, even a bit negative in the past few years. This has to do. with the volatility of earnings, our U.S. portfolio. But also I'd say, a rather cautious stance on. some of the more commoditized segments. We've been -- we have been rather diligent,. not to go into some of these RFPs with very competitively priced approaches. And that. has led -- this has led to a market share, which is a bit under here.. As we proceed and address the U.S. legacy challenges, I feel that the earnings generation. will go up again. And there are some opportunities in the pipeline. But the picture is a bit. different in life and health.. If you turn to the next slide with the same view with EBIT contribution. You see steady. earnings coming. But a bit more volatile. It is very much related to the U.S. mortality. market. So 1.1% combined aggregate growth rate and a growth which we believe will go. up in the next few years, in life and health.. To close off this short section on the review, we -- this slide you've seen before. But one. which I think captures very well the fact that we see some good opportunities in the. market where we see the reinsurance space is attractive. We're optimistic about the. outlook. We see some of the demand drivers going in the right direction. Our value. concentration, which give opportunities, particularly on the NatCat side.. There are huge protection gaps everywhere, life and nonlife. And I think these are. opportunities which we should tap into under insurance, in particular, as a challenge. We. have new products, new opportunities. The cyber market is one example of a risk. category, which has been growing.. And I think, generally, the capital requirements, challenges, the volatility, management. challenges make reinsurance generally part of the conversation with the CFO, with the. CRO, with insurance companies, creating really a clear opportunity for us, whether we talk. about new risk, new markets, dysfunctions, volatility of earnings or capital requirements,. challenges. We feel we're very well positioned as a go-to partner.. We bring the capital base to offer real convincing solutions and take on risk. We have. some tailor-made services and solutions. And I think we're a go-to partner, which. understands the clients very well and is able to react very quickly and address some of. the clients' challenges. So the outlook is rather positive for us. And we see our space as. attractive and our positioning as strong. So I come into the company with a positive. outlook on the next few years.. So moving on to the business model, which you know very well. But I'd like to give you. some comment and more personally on what I've seen in the past few months. We use. the tag line ""somewhat different."" We've been doing so for a number of years. And this. should really give a summary of how we feel the business model operates, lean and. focused and client-centric and -- and certainly, when you see these numbers. And that was. a bit -- the entry point for me to look back at the last 10 years.. You see in terms of growth and ROE and net income, a scattered state of performance.. It's always frightening, actually, to come into the company at this stage. But I say that halfjokingly, I think there is a strong team, a strong model, which is a base we tap into to. pursue that journey.. But clearly, that ""somewhat different"" tagline, related to the business model, is a good. proxy for what we've been trying to achieve the past few years. And I see business model. continuity as a given, not coming into the company with new plans on how we want to. operate. I think the philosophy is the right one. And we'll leverage that base in the next. few years.. So this is a little bit a summary of what I saw in the first few months when I came in and I. was trying to ask myself, what are the key elements in that business model, which make. Hannover Re distinct in their approach to business. And I think it's very much business. model and corporate culture for me. And the first one, which is not new. But it needs to. be reiterated is the underwriting culture that we have. A company with a very strong. underwriting DNA, a lot of discipline in how we approach the business, life and nonlife.. And a real culture of underwriting, which I was very impressed about. There is a fair level. of empowerment on decision-making, which also is part of the model of making sure that. we take sound. But swift decision that we have full empowerment of the lead. underwriters in their areas of responsibility.. So strong underwriting discipline, strong underwriting culture. That's the DNA we need to. continue and maintain and continue to strengthen in the future.. I think related to that, the second point would be the client focus. I see the company very. focused on the client needs, very much trying to increase loyalty and that sense of. partnership with the client is very much a part of how we work. I know that many. companies say so. But I was very impressed in the past few months. Talking to clients in. different regions to see that notion of partnerships being mentioned consistently. And this. is about being reliable, being consistent, no surprise, being really a true partner across. cycles and help out clients when they really need us. And this is something we will nurture. and want to continue to build on. I'm quite passionate about that one and feel there's. even more potential to continue in that direction.. The third one is the lean model and the cost leadership. Roland will say a bit more on cost. leadership. So I won't go into detail there. But clearly, this is, for me, very impressive. because you see that it's not only a top-down philosophy. This is very much part of the. culture, that's the way we operate. We try to be nimble. We don't want to create. complexity in terms of organizational setup and we try to be swift in terms of decisionmaking and that makes the difference often in front of clients.. And cost leadership doesn't mean that we're cheap. It's more of an attitude of really. making sure that we invest when we see a business case and that we stay nimble and. don't try to increase our cost base or increase complexity. So that's part of the culture.. That's hard to replicate. It's easily said. It's not that easy to replicate and implement in. practice. And I think we have a huge advantage there, which we'll build on. Coming from. Swiss Re, of course, there were some question marks on whether the cost leadership will. be part of the value proposition. And I can just reiterate once more, that this is very much. where we focus on. We want to have that cost advantage, which can make the difference. on some of the decisions on the business.. And last but not least, we'll hear more from colleagues from Roland, from Andreas later. on this morning. I think the capital management has been effective. We had a good ROE. performance. I think the retro strategy has been also very successful. And we'll continue. to build on a strong retro protection on the P&C side. We have some retro protection on. Life & Health side. But less prominent in terms of numbers.. So this is very much what I felt were areas of strength and competitive advantages for the. company, is the semi-outside in perspective. I validated that and six months later, I would. say, it's very much part of the corporate culture, part of the business model, the operating. model we have and the base we want to build on for the future.. This just to -- and again, this is a slide you have seen, which is showing the standard. deviation in the spread and variability of our return on equity over 5 and 10 years. And. clearly, you're showing Hannover Re in a specific box if you want and with a few points. ahead of major competitors. I think that's our benchmark. And we will try to continue on. that journey.. And here, again, the target matrix, just not to comment into the details in a couple of. weeks, we'll have our Q3 figures. And we'll be able to come back to the target matrix. But. just showing in terms of the current strategy cycle, we are well on track.. If you look at all the metrics, we are meeting or exceeding the target. So a very pleasing. starting point. 2018 was really ticking the boxes in spite of a difficult NatCat season. The. picture, of course, for the first half does not include some of the NatCat events, which. took place later on this year. But we'll update you soon on that. But basically, as we end. the strategy cycle next year, I believe we're very, very well positioned and are meeting. our targets.. So moving on to the third section of this presentation, I'd like to some extent, to reiterate. some of the things we want to continue to build on and then move on to some of the. initiatives we we're working on.. I think in property casualty, again, we are having a very strong market franchise across the. globe. We have a broker model. We really focus on distribution with the brokers. And it. works very well. The feedback I've received was really positive. The responsiveness is. seen as second to none. And I think the market -- generally the market feedback is. positive.. Most of the clients in Monte Carlo or in Colorado Springs a few weeks ago told me they. want to grow with us. So that's a notion, which is new to me. I don't feel that glass ceiling,. which I did a few years ago. So I think we build on a very, very strong market franchise with. the potential to remain a preferred partner and to strengthen that base.. Europe and North America continue to be, of course, our core markets. We have -- we. continue to expand relationships in both markets.. In North America, we have -- we're going to have more momentum because the primary. pricing is going up and reinsurance as well. I believe we'll have due to the NatCat. experience, some price momentum. But we'll talk about Asia. It's not yet that prominent.. It's 15% of the total today, excluding Australia.. But these are the core markets where we'll see further growth in the next few years. I. think we are very well positioned in the specialty space. We have very strong teams.. We're strong in many of the different lines of business. And we've taken the stance to be. an active participant in the cyberspace.. We are continuing to grow with some key clients. But obviously, an area where we need to. strengthen our risk management and modeling capabilities and this is a topic we'll come. back. I think Silke will talk briefly about cyber. And from a risk management standpoint,. Andreas will also talk about cyber reinsurance.. Think structure solutions, again, a topic we want to highlight today. P&C and Life & Health,. actually Klaus Miller talk about it as well, is a space where we've been successful. We have. a portfolio, which is, I think, in P&C, EUR 3.6 billion of top line has been steady. And we see. some growth potential.. And again, bottom line goes first. We're fortunate to grow, have top line growth. But the. margin requirements need to be met and the reserving continues to be very. conservative. So a very strong position with continuity of the model, as I said, profitable. growth for the next few years but underlying that underwriting discipline.. So these are more repetition. But I'd like to reiterate how important it is for us in areas. where we will see continuity in our model.. Moving on to Life & Health. We have a setup, as you know, which is a bit different, with a. more decentralized approach. We have a strong global network of entities around the. world and offer really underwriting and product development solutions.. We're very close to our clients and the notion of partnerships also is key to success. We. have very strong teams in the different regions. Financial solutions or structured solutions. is also part of the mix. We have a very strong team in North America, in particular. But are. also expanding in other regions.. I see financial solutions as really an important part of the mix. Longevity, actually, there is. also a good pipeline of projects. It's a line of business where we've been a leading player. in. And we'll continue to do so. It's still very much U.K.-centric, of course. But I think over. time, we'll see some opportunities in other markets. But I think we want to play in the. longevity space.. One of the observations, of course, the U.S. legacy problems in the past, have been an. area where Klaus Miller has had to spend a lot of time on. And I think we're moving, we're. proceeding very, very well. I think we are on track in managing that legacy portfolio. We'll. hear more later today. But generally, I feel we are on track.. But as we want to grow, I also wanted to make sure that the in-force management in Life. & Health is being strengthened. So there are some of the resources, which we allocate. for this year and next year, which goes into -- which go into the in-force portfolio. management. That's an important part. And we want to continue our growth trajectory.. We need to be really best-in-class in managing the in-force and getting the insights from. in-force management into pricing into the way we operate the risk appetite we have. generally.. And last but not least, innovation plays a very clear role. In Life & Health, there's probably. more of a push element, you need to come with new ideas. You need to come with a. product development opportunities and sometimes we bring digital partners in the. relationship, an area where I see expansion opportunities.. Again, topics which we'll hear more about in the course of today. So I think we're. expanding. From now on, we have a solid base. But we need to build on a strengthened. life in-force management. That's an important part of making sure we can grow. successfully and with sustainable performance.. So coming now to some of the topics, which, as a team, we're working on building on all. these aspects, which will be part of the continuity of the business model.. There are 4 I wanted to mention. There are other initiatives which are more internal and. more related to our culture. And I won't go into all details here. But I think the Asia Pacific. strategy has been an area where we felt we can accelerate. And we'll hear more from. Claude on that. We have a strong base. The clients are keen to work with us. But I see. some potential. But also a need to reframe a bit and make sure in terms of resource. allocation, we put some more emphasis on Asia.. I briefly talk about digital innovation. This is, of course, a very broad topic. What I've seen. in the past few months is that we have many interesting projects and initiatives in that. space, building on relationships with clients, linking them with InsurTech companies. But. what I'd like to put forward to the team is, how can we replicate some of the success. stories, how can we make it more relevant to our investors so that we really can show. numbers behind some of these projects in the next few years. So we're working on that.. And we'll offer more feedback on how we want to proceed in that space.. The third is very much customer-centricity. As I said, customer loyalty, partnerships are. part of how we work. But I also think that as we grow, we need to think a little bit more. strategically about key client relationships, we need to have a bit more insights on how we. operate, have a strong customer relationship management base to operate from. So that. we are very well coordinated, that we see opportunities early on that we can be even. more proactive looking at kind of an end-to-end view on our customer relationships.. So we're not going to build an infrastructure around it. We're not going to create new. functions around it. This is very much the idea to support our underwriting teams to be. alert, be well informed, to see cross-selling opportunities in the future. So CRM and. broadening client relationships are questions to the team, which will be discussed soon.. And last but not least, more of a soft topic. But I think competition for talent, nothing new.. It continues to be tough. And whereas, we haven't suffered very much from this problem. so far because we have a very high loyalty in our organization.. Clearly, there are some key underwriters, key people in the company in the next five. years, who will be retiring. And there is obviously an issue around succession plans. And. we need to make sure we're very well-organized so that we make sure that, that. succession takes place in an effective way. But also the younger talents, I think we can do. a bit more in making sure that they can develop their skill set and can gain that end-toend view on the business. So talent mobility is a topic we're working on. And I'm quite. optimistic that this will be positive for talent development, opportunities for our people.. But also succession planning.. I'll very briefly, I've talked about some of these aspects. I have a few slides on these 4. topics. So Asia Pacific, the numbers speak a clear language with 45% of global insurance. premiums being part of the 27% mix in the statistics. So clearly, there is a shift happening,. nothing new. But we feel we need to be more systematic in order to tap into these. opportunities.. As mentioned, we'll strengthen the local footprint. We won't expand in terms of the. locations or legal entity set up at this stage. We feel that we have what it takes. But we. need to staff up some of the local offices. We've taken already some decisions in that. direction. And have identified a number of initiatives, which Claude will comment on.. We're really based on business plans, we allocate resources. And if it works, we will staff. up; if not, we'll reframe and look at alternative opportunities. But basically, in terms of. We want to keep that lean structure. We want to make sure we have empowered. management and that speed of execution remains part of how we work. But we feel. specifically for Asia Pacific that we need to strengthen the local presence. This has no. precedent-setting on other regions. I think the model we have in P&C with a centralized. team for North America, in particular, with other regions, works well. So no big plan to. change the setup or the footprint in other regions.. This is very much APAC specific. We want to increase our market share. But we know it's a. tough market. We know it's competitive. We'll be diligent. The underwriting acumen is key. to success. And we won't grow for the sake of it. So we're very much bottom line. oriented. We hope we can execute on our plans. But not if we can only reach top line. growth. It needs to be profitable.. Briefly coming back to digital innovation. I think there are several aspects, which our team. is working on. I think the efficiency play for us, for our own value chain is important. We. continue to try to make progress there. The automation of interfaces with our business. partners is an important component.. There are some industry initiatives, which are mentioned on this slide and where we're an. active participant in. We feel this is certainly the way to go. And there is much -- a lot of. scope for simplification, standardization for non-added value part of the process.. The new business opportunities, of course, are always part of the mix. Cyber is the most. prominent example of that. But I hope we will see some other themes emerging and. giving us an opportunity to expand. And the one where we still need to take a stance. where we're probably less prominent than others make less -- comment less publicly on is. the whole area of digital InsurTech and Fintech and how we can play a role in that space.. We have a number of data analytics specialists. And as I said, some projects which are. promising.. But what we want to do is see if there is maybe a case to do things a bit differently. instead of trying to become a private equity player and invest into Fintech, which would. not be our preference. That's not our core strength. Is there maybe a way to become. very skilled at managing partnerships and bringing Fintech, InsurTech, new entrants into. the mix and supporting our clients.. But this with the reinsurance positioning. We're not trying to improvise ourselves as a. primary player. We know our strength. But I think there is a case to be made to manage. these partnerships and also to expand on data analytics capabilities.. This is an area where the Life & Health colleagues have been particularly strong in. But I. think also in property casualty, there is some scope for further advancement there. As. mentioned, this is not a very material part of our revenue base. But if you add up the. many pilots and initiatives we've been pursuing.. In the past few years, this is part of the value proposition. And I hope in the next few. years, we can make it a more prominent part of what we do and make it relevant and. create value and also generate business out of it. So more to be worked on. I know it's. still a bit generic for today. But there are some examples you're aware of.. (Equarium) is something we might comment on later on, on the Life & Health side. We. started P&C as well. This is a platform for exchange with Fintech companies, which is. expanding. And we make it open to our clients. We have some good traction on the. Perseus is an example of a cyber player, who offers services and prevention in the. cyberspace. ReFlex is our underwriting tool, which you know about. And we have some. pilot initiatives in the personal line space, where we use data analysts and help some of. our clients to get some data insights, look for product development opportunities, look. for cross-selling or opportunities to fine-tune the claims management processes. So. these are all areas where we want to see, is there application potential, are there. opportunities to create some more scale.. The customer-centricity part I've commented on. I don't want to repeat. But I think as. much as we start from a strong base, there's still some strong potential with many of our. existing client relationships that we can broaden. We need to have this holistic view of the. customer relationships and try to make sure we can capture opportunities across the. board and have a conversation at C-suite level. Which is often happening but needs to be. strengthened in the future. There's a lot about cooperation and having people who have. an assigned role to understand the full scope of the relationship with some of the most. important clients.. So we already have a key account management part of what we do, more P&C centric,. that we want to expand there and see some cross-selling opportunities in the future. So. more on this. And we have a CRM tool, which we'll want to strengthen, to help our. underwriters get really important information on our clients and be well prepared for. client meetings, et cetera.. So more to comment on in the New Year. And lastly, I commented on talent management,. again, something where we don't feel this is new. But this is more of an acceleration. I. think we need to be best-in-class in-sourcing key talents, sort of the younger talents. coming out of university, make sure that we have a compelling proposition.. And I think what I've seen talking to younger talents in our companies, one consistent. theme is the fact that they're very early in their career, they can take responsibility. There. is this sense of empowerment in the company that is unique. And it's not always easy for. for projects and be a really part of the business team.. So I think we offer something different, somewhat different, as we say, to our talents. But. want to win that battle. I mentioned mobility, not for everyone. But I think the notion of. view.. make sure we can also adapt to a different mix, probably in terms of mix of generation.. But also more diversity in the next few years.. And last but not least, the fact that some of our key people in the next five years will be in. their retirement age and the fact that we need to prepare for that moment very. thoroughly. So succession plans is a key part of what we do.. These are not groundbreaking, new topics. But I think it's worth mentioning because it will. gain an importance in how we manage the company.. So to finish off. And then this is a bit the starting point, which we had a few months ago.. We had the 150 top leaders at Hannover Re meeting in Berlin. And this was a bit the base. for our discussion. I think the mission is really to strive to perform at our full potential. I. think we have a lot of potential to continue to outperform the market. I think the clientcentricity aspect is very important to me. And I'd like to hear that positive client feedback. in the future.. And the fact that we want to outperform the market in terms of growth, in terms of ROE,. remains part of the mix. We want consistency in that growth and our performance pattern.. And the notion of partnerships is very much key to what we do. That's why we said we. want to be the go-to partner for our traditional clients. But also for new entrants and for. brokers on the P&C side. So more on these aspects.. This is the platform for our team to work on. As mentioned, January is an internal. milestone for us. And in the new year, we'll get back to you with a bit more specifics. But I. hope it gives you a sense for the general direction. So the message is a lot of continuity,. respect for the model. We want to build on it. These strengths are recognized. But there. Karl Steinle. Well thank you. Thank you very much, Jean-Jacques. I'd like to open the Q&A session. And. as always, I would ask to wait for the microphone so that everybody can hear your. question, even those who are participating via the webcast. And I already see some. hands up. And we start with Kamran and continue with Vinit and Vikram.. Questions And Answers. Kamran Hossain. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. You've talked a lot about the excellent platform that you've. inherited, returns being fantastic over a number of years. You talk about the areas that. you're keen to pursue. As you're -- in your review, when you came into the business, what. do you think the biggest threat was? Or what's the biggest concern? I just want to know. whether it's kind of digital or being relevant or what's the kind of #1 concern on your list?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So indeed, a lot of my observation points were validating and confirming the model. And I. think it's sufficiently agile and flexible to adapt to new opportunities and circumstances.. What I feel is the challenge put forward to us as a team is that short term, I think even. without changes, I would see a similar pattern in terms of the numbers we produce in the. next three years, just roughly, more the short-term view. But the question of relevance will. increase in importance. And my sense is that we have a few years ahead to get prepared.. It's not that we need to change everything next week. But we need to adapt. And it's not. yet clear to me where. But it's clear that we need to make sure that as we invest limited. resources into growth, into the model, keeping our cost leadership, we need to take a. stance on these 2 or 3 items, which are important.. But I would say, short-term outlook very positive. Midterm, the 3; to 5-year view, some. unknown on where things are going, how clients will behave. Consolidation is one. example. Technology is another. And we need to take a stance on where to invest. Not. across the board, we want to be very focused. But these items are certainly -- which I. mentioned today, are certainly top of mind. I think innovation generally will be more and. more part of the mix in reinsurance. And what we do more in life and health, where. innovation is really part of the game to get access to the business, we'll probably be. more prominent in P&C in the next few years. So being innovative in terms of mindset. But. there's also capabilities, will probably be the midterm imperative.. And if we don't do anything, we don't try to strengthen our position there, there is a. midterm threat. But I don't see -- again, I said that we're optimistic about the outlook. I. think we feel the reinsurance space has plenty of room to operate in. With our market. share, it's also obviously easier to say than if you have a larger market share and you feel. the glass ceiling. But I do believe that there is a midterm unknown on where it's going and. innovation should be a differentiator.. Karl Steinle. So the next question is coming from Vinit.. Vinit Malhotra. Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. So just -- I'm surprised you highlighted Asia Pac because I. remember in the last years, we have seen so much conversations around, say, the CROSS or the Chinese motor quota shares, you name it. I mean Hannover Re has been in. and out and has been very prominent in some of those trends. So if you could just. elaborate a bit more about why you see this gap or where you see the gap. And just. speaking to territory, as you mentioned, that the glass ceiling is not there. And I think you. mentioned the context of a U.S. meeting you had. Isn't then the U.S. really the area that. you should continue to keep pushing?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. I think we have been there in Asia Pacific. It's not that we -- we've been consistent. I. think we've been building a very sound portfolio. So in a way, this is not something which. comes as a new topic, quite the contrary. As a matter of fact, as I came in earlier this year,. (inaudible) was also focusing on that. So I took it with me as part of the mix.. It's -- the difference with the United States or North America generally is that we need to. adapt a little bit in terms of our setup. That's the difference. So it's not that United States. would not be top of mind. It is top of mind. It is very much part of our portfolio strength.. The growth outlook continues to be there. But we feel we're very well positioned and we. have what it takes. So there is no need for me to make it a strategic initiative. This is more. of a business as usual setup. And if and when there are emerging opportunities, we'll. responsibilities are very clear and it's without a doubt a key market for all my tenure,. however long it will be. And that's not the notion that we are less interested in North. But we need to operate with more local footprint in particular. This is a process which. needs a bit more attention. So it's not a new focus on Asia. It's simply an acknowledgment. that over the next few years, I showed the 27 figure, the growth pattern is evident and we. need to be there as well.. So it's a continuity and an acceleration of an existing strategy rather than a topic coming. up new. We are very well aware of the many hurdles and potential challenges, be it. regulatory challenges or competitive pressure. So we don't underestimate how. challenging it is to operate in that region. But it needs to be part of the mix. It needs to be. part of our diversified portfolio. That's why it's highlighted specifically.. Karl Steinle. There's Andrew -- Vikram.. Vikram Gandhi. Vik from SocGen. Just a couple of quick questions. Can you give us an insight or perhaps. numbers around the P&C business mix in terms of broker versus the direct business? And. the reason I ask this is over the past few years, at least from 2015 to '18, what I've. observed is your admin expense ratio on P&C has been quite flattish, which is great,. between 2% and 2.5%. But your acquisition expense ratio has kind of gone up significantly.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. The one that's in the...?. Vikram Gandhi. The acquisition expense ratio on the P&C side, I see a steep increase between '15 and '18. consistently year-over-year. Just a sense of what's happening in the mix in terms of broker. versus direct business. That's question number one.. And second is you mentioned telematics briefly. I just wondered if you can perhaps. expand a bit more on what your thoughts are as a business opportunity or what's really. going on in telematics in Germany, because that's been quite prevalent in Italy, telematics.. And perhaps even in the U.K. Yes. That's all from my side.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well thank you very much. On the mix, if I'm not mistaken, I think the 60% plus to 2/3 of. the P&C business would be broker. So a very prominent part of what we do in P&C. I think. we have a conscious model, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon part of the world, where we. feel this is the best model to operate in. But in the end, this is not our decision. This is a. decision which the clients need to take. And we respect the clients' decision-making. But. we operate very well on the broker side. And indeed, that means that we don't have. huge teams taking care of client relationships or trying to focus more on R&D and. servicing, the brokers do part of it.. I cannot really respond to the question on the acquisition expenses, if there's a specific. driver on transactions. But I don't know if Roland, if you have insights on the driver for the. '15 to '18%s?. Roland Helmut Vogel. As you are referring to the commissions -- is this -- do we just push? Okay. Thank you. I. think one. And I don't have the number with me now, Vikram. But we have increased our. proportion of proportional contracts rather than nonproportional contracts. I think Silke will. comment on more advanced solutions. And in that respect, the commission in that area of. proportional contract is higher as compared to the nonproportional. So I think that mix has. also driven the commissions up.. I don't think that a change in acquisition approach is really the driver behind it. And. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. On telematics, we have decided to work with a specialist company developing a tool,. which can be used by our clients. That's a service which is provided to the German market. at this stage. And it's still early stages. A pity that Michael Pickel is not in the room because. he would give you a bit more color on the project itself. But it's an idea to really support. our clients and as a contribution to receive some reinsurance proceeds out of the. collaboration, be it on the motor business piece of the portfolio or other, we're not going. to operate as a fee-based player there. That's not the model at all.. But it's an example. Still small in terms of earnings contribution, which offer us the. possibility to give service without building up our own infrastructure. We -- again, this is this. idea of taking the capabilities where we find them strongest. And here, you have a fintech. type of setup helping us servicing our clients.. So if this is successful, if we feel there is traction, obviously, there's always this question. on replicating the model elsewhere. In Europe, Italy is the most obvious market and U.K.,. of course. But it's early days for us. So we need to gain an experience this year, next year. in the German market.. Karl Steinle. Okay. We have another question from.... Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I think Andrew has been waiting for a while. But.... Karl Steinle. Okay. Andrew and then Thomas.. Andrew James Ritchie. Maybe it's a cheeky question to start. You talked about you were struck by the. underwriting culture of Hanover when you arrived. A lot of companies, in fact, I can't think. of any company I cover that doesn't talk about their underwriting culture. What is it that's. really different? I'm just curious on how you contrast it with any previous experiences in. terms of what is the depth of underwriting culture, how is it different at Hannover? The. second question, I'm assuming your strategy is reinsurance, only reinsurance. As in you. have a joint venture on the direct side with HDI. And that would be the extent of your. interest in any more direct operations, I guess, apart from facultative business, which is. quasi-direct. So maybe just your thoughts on that. And finally, your predecessor company. is famous for its spider diagrams for client contacts and the amount it's done on CRM and. the client, making sure you service the client in every possible way. Is that the kind of level. of contact you aspire to? And is that -- have you sort of quantified the revenue. opportunity there? Is it material? Is there really an underdeveloped -- you used the word. CRM lots of times, which is a -- is that really underdeveloped at Hannover? I didn't think it. was that underdeveloped.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Andrew, for this question. On the underwriting culture, for me, what struck me. behind the -- what set the company, as I observed it as a competitor, is the level of. empowerment of the underwriter and the ability to really take decisions, take ownership. for their portfolio. And there is a decentralized approach. There's a lot of trust in the. underwriting judgment. And that level of ownership I haven't seen before. That's the. difference.. It might sound a bit simple. But it's very much day-to-day what the clients perceive, say,. we are in front of a decision maker. We are in front of someone who is able, if there is a. change in conditions, a change in the structure, to reflect and come back to us very quickly. and give the commitment, give the capacity, that swift approach. But really with an indepth underwriting judgment, combined with trust and empowerment is something I. haven't seen before.. So this was a really, really positive insights I gained. And I want to nurture that because I. think in the end, you need responsibility. You need that end-to-end feeling, you need that. profit center thinking, you need to nurture your portfolio and you need to be responsive. to the clients' needs. So we continue to build on that very much.. Reinsurance only, indeed, there is a portfolio which we decided to have in cooperation. with the Talanx group on some of these specialty lines. And we feel it's a better. positioning because in the end, we are, although we are invested into the joint venture,. we are a minority investor and we have a long-term arrangement to have part of the. business, roughly 45% of the business, reinsured with us. So we feel a bit more in our. element, if you want, as a true reinsurance player and then the company can operate with. their own underwriting goals and business plans.. So this works for us. And I can only confirm that the positioning is reinsurance positioning.. So a different perspective, because we feel that the reinsurance space is attractive. We. feel there is growth potential and we feel this -- we want to play to our strength. I know. very well how difficult it is to operate reinsurance and insurance in the same company.. These are very different cultures, different models. And I think being focused on our core. business is the way to go very much.. Fact, of course, is in P&C and also single-risk underwriting, in life and health, the closest. you can get to primary insurance. And I do believe in the future, talking about technology,. talking about some of the new risks, that we need to have a good understanding for the. primary sector and also maybe recruit people who have some primary background. But. always with a reinsurance perspective. I think that's the way to go.. And you call it spider, I call it the noodle slide, actually, because they had so many touch. points. This is not the model. First of all, we have no intention to change the organizational. setup. We are, as I said, profit center oriented, business unit oriented. So we don't want. to change that and have a distinctive operation dealing with some of the largest key. accounts. That's not the model. I want people to be really operating across segments.. And I think where I see potential is having this notion of a virtual team of people operating. as a network so that we have one face to the customer. So that all people who have touch. points with the customers do have inside knowledge of how Hannover Re is performing,. how Hannover Re is interacting. But in those circumstances, would I want to go that far,. because in the end, I think part of the job is the brokers.. And I do believe that, as you said, we have the right philosophy and we are client-centric.. So it's not that we're not strong. But as we grow, as there is a certain level of complexity. also with our clients, I think making sure that we use CRM as a way to collaborate, to share. knowledge and to be consistent across geographies is an important way. But you won't. see next year a slide with 700 touch points for a medium-size enterprise study. That is not. the idea.. So maybe less complexity and more reliance on the intermediaries would be my. response.. Karl Steinle. We continue with Thomas and then James.. Thomas Fossard. Thomas Fossard from HSBC. A high-level question for you on the -- on your assessment. of the Hannover Re risk appetite in the current environment. I mean how do you -- how. would you qualify the risk appetite of Hannover Re compared to other people in the. market? And if you're thinking about accelerating your business, I mean, should we expect. a change in the risk appetite? You're starting with a very strong balance sheet, high. solvency, strong reserves. Hannover Re has been a countercyclical company in the past.. We are seeing a lot of changes in the -- among your competitors in the way they are. assessing risk and they are retrenching in some lines. So I mean put it in a nutshell. I mean. are you thinking that today, Hannover Re could do more and this is the right time to. expand a bit more on the risk -- on the risk curve? Or you think that actually, things are still. fine today and this is not the way for you to grow the business?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Thomas. No, for me, I mean I was really struck by the diversification of the. portfolio. This is really very, very well thought-through, well constructed. And from that. standpoint, the short-term outlook is a lot about continuity. I think in each of the different. lines, subject to pricing conditions, there is growth potential.. So I would say that in terms of the business mix, I wouldn't see a lot of changes short. term. I would say there's a question mark on NatCat depending on where the pricing. goes. And there, we see some potential for growth. We have said so in the past. But it. won't go to an imbalance. We don't want to jeopardize the diversification on our business. mix. But we might be able to allocate some more capacity in NatCat if and where the. condition are right. And maybe Silke might have a comment on NatCat generally.. Cyber, I think we arrive at a point where we've been learning a lot, a lot of insights on the. cyber exposures. Where we need to work hard on some of the technical questions, there. is an industry-wide challenge with silent exposures, which we need to tackle and in the. affirmative covers. Obviously, the accumulation risk remains a general concern. So we. want to address that specifically. So I don't see continuous long-term growth at the same. pace. So I would want to make some progress. So we'll talk about it, modeling of the risk,. maybe diversifying, if you can say diversifying in cyber, that's the question mark. But. diversifying into different geographies and segments would be another part of what we. want to do.. And so clearly, cyber is an area where I'm -- more an environment where we're very, very. cautious and have seen some more entrepreneurial spirit within boundaries. There is a. natural barrier to further growth unless we can tackle some of the challenges.. Again, we'll talk more about cyber. But I think structured solutions generally is an area, life. and nonlife, where I see a lot of traction. And I would be more than willing to continue on. that path and see some more deals being completed. But we'll do it pragmatically as. opportunities arise. But the exposures are not different exposures. So in the end, it's a bit. of a different way to tackle the business, different driver for demand, more C-suite. related. But I think we're very strong in that space. And I feel this is one part of our. business which will continue to grow. It might be more prominent. But it's more lumpy, it's. less easy to plan. But mid long term, it will be a very prominent part of what we do. That's. why we wanted to present a bit what we do there today, P&C and life and health.. So no big changes, really, in terms of initial views on risk appetite. But I'm more than ready. to openly speak to the team if and where we see opportunities, if there are changes in. conditions making some of the lines more attractive. So I think it's more tactical than. strategic. It's more cycle management related at this stage.. James Austin Shuck. It's James Shuck from Citi. I had 2 questions, please. It seems as if the group is emerging. from another period of cost culture, very much focused on squeezing what you've got, to. perhaps greasing the engine a little bit more and investing for the future. That might be. CRM, it might be digital investments. What is the outlook for the admin expense ratio. going forward? As you do all of that, will you manage to keep it flat? Or do you anticipate. some expenditure on that front, please?. Secondly, interested on Slide 19, automating the interfaces to clients and intermediaries.. How ready are your IT systems in terms of that actual journey? And how do you compare. versus peers currently on being able to do that? Are there any particular problems you. anticipate in being able to automate and does it require an investment in order to do so?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, James. On the cost culture, clearly, the message is that we want to. keep that philosophy. We want to keep that edge. And clearly, that's a bit the ceiling I'm. setting myself as I looked at the business plans for the next three years.. For me, it's very, very important that we keep that cost advantage. So I want to make sure. we have the differential versus our competitors and that's a little bit budget limitations. It's. not that small. I think as we grow, we have potential to allocate more resources. But I want. to do this very, very diligently. So if we execute on our plans in the next few years, you. should see continuity in terms of cost ratio.. This being said, if we feel there is an initiative, an area where there's a one-off investment. needs in the next few years, as a team, we'll need to take a stance on whether there is a. case to be made in terms of future competitive advantage, which might lead us to. sacrifice 0.1, 0.2 of the cost advantage for the benefit of our future growth outlook.. But the philosophy and the approach I'm taking is that cost leadership is key to success.. James Austin Shuck. If I could follow up quickly on that. So one might expect other people's admin expense. ratios to improve slightly. You'll be investing a little bit more. So by definition, that gap may. close. I'm just interested to interpret what you're saying properly. I mean will the absolute. admin expense ratio increase? Is it a case of maintaining that gap? I just want to clarify. that.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I think you'll see continuity in terms of cost ratio. You don't see, probably not an. improvement at this stage. But you don't -- we don't see a deterioration happening. anytime soon. I see Roland being passionate.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. I think you would really have to wait another 30 minutes or so.. And I will come back to exactly that point. That is one of my parts. In respect of automated. account and automization in our internal processes, as compared to the competition,. difficult to say. You have seen that we are members of (inaudible), which is the ACORD. system. We are the B3i. But this is more the future. We do have, with every bigger broker,. automated interfaces implemented. I get numbers on a monthly basis. The last I got was. that more than 100,000 of accounts have been processed automatically. Again, I cannot. tell you how much that is compared to the bigger competitors. But this end-to-end. And. these robot things, which we have implemented so that we get -- our accountants get. information, claims information, into there via e-mail, very traditionally sometimes via email. And that is processed automatically into our systems. That is really increasing. That is. one point. And I will come back to that, again, in 30 minutes. That is one point where we -why we feel that the expense advantage which we have should be sustainable.. Karl Steinle. Well Vinit, you have another question. But we are already a little bit over the time. And so. we'd like to continue.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. We can come later if you wish.. Karl Steinle. There's plenty of room later on. So keep that question for later. Well thank you very much. for your presentation and for answering all the questions. Thank you for your questions. If. you can, please restrain your enthusiasm for the upcoming, soon upcoming coffee break.. But we have another presentation from Roland. And according to a long tradition. And a. gesture of our transparency, you can now take a look at Roland's desk. The clicker is here.. Since we have only allocated 20 minutes for his presentation, I'm afraid there are only 2. issues he might address. It's the investment update. And the second one is, as James has. already referred to, it's about the cost. And so he won't bore you with IFRS 17. But enjoy it.. +++presentation. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes. Thank you very much, Karl. As anticipated, you were more interested to hear a. young, new CEO rather than an old CFO. This is why I had already volunteered to serve as. a buffer. And this is why I have only 2 topics brought with me, one of which is the. investment update. I think you're used to the slides still and I also think I have used that as. one of the headlines. What a difference a year makes.. So in that regard, it might still be interesting to look at these slides, the portfolio yields,. the maturing yields, the years of maturities, currencies, modified duration and then stop. one more time to give you a little bit of an indication how I and we will try to cope with the. latest or the recent developments on the capital markets, especially with regards to. interest rates and especially here, the euro.. Moreover, we felt it might make sense to address the expense ratio issue. More than. once during road shows, investor calls, investor meetings, we have been challenged,. teased, provoked, not to say annoyed, with exactly the theory which James, you. mentioned. We have a competitive advantage today. So our expense ratio is very much. down. So we obviously have explored all our potentials. The rest of the industry has more. potential. So is this competitive advantage sustainable? Or will there be a reversion to a. state-of-the-art or an industry thing? And I will try to do my best to convince you that the. opposite is the case.. If we have time. And it doesn't seem as if we will, we can talk a little bit about IFRS 17 or. you might have also heard that we have issued a hybrid bond recently, EUR 750 million.. There is a first call date upcoming next year. So in this regard, this gave us the chance to. potentially refinance that early on.. We've increased the volumes a little bit. So if you're interested, I could comment on that. as well. I have no slides with me in that respect.. So let's start with the investment portfolio. And we have defined a few principles, which. are to create the framework or define the framework in which we will -- we are investing. today.. So first of all, we have again defined liquidity requirements. And that doesn't mean only. cash on a bank account. So every single security has a liquidity factor with it. And we have. defined the liquidity of the portfolio, which we want to keep. So one of the aspects is, we. feel that we are where we want to be. And all the new definitions will have to bear in mind. that we want to keep the liquidity profile of the overall portfolio approximately where it is. today. So that means if we want to address. And we will come to that a little bit later on,. more illiquid assets, then we will have to find substitutions elsewhere to have the profile. defined. So that is one criteria.. We are diversifying our credit risk over the whole spectrum. That is, we mentioned that. before, we no longer continue to have that barbell strategy. But not only with regards to. quality. But also geographical diversification. So we have also kind of explored a little bit,. especially emerging markets, credit risk in the portfolio. So that is one point where we are",20191023_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Shareholder_Mtg_Call_2019-10-23_SD000000002903050937.pdf,2019-10-23
2,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Interim Results 1/2015. For your information, this conference is being. recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich. Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our. conference call presenting our results for the first quarter of 2015. As always, I'm joined by. our CFO, Roland Vogel. Given that today is also the date of our annual general meeting of. our shareholders, we are holding this call rather early.. I've also heard that one of our competitors is reporting today as well so we will try to be. rather punctual and finish at around 10:15 to give you the opportunity, if you wish so, to do. other things. With this in mind, Roland and I will try to keep our comments as brief as. possible to make sure that we have sufficient time left over for the Q&A session.. I'm pleased to report that Hannover Re had an excellent start into the year 2015 with a. group net income of €280 million, an increase of 20% and a gross written premium. growth of 10% on a ForEx adjusted basis, the first quarter has seen a successful first step. to achieving our full-year guidance. This is especially gratifying against the backdrop of. continued difficult environment for the international reinsurers, in particular, due to the. fierce competition mainly on the P&C side as well as the continued challenges that are. presented to ourselves by the very low interest rate.. The very good profitability of the first quarter is based on excellent results of our Life &. Health reinsurance business and continued good underwriting results of our Property &. Casualty business. At 13.9%, we were, again, able to achieve an attractive return on equity. despite the fact that the shareholders' equity is further grown by roughly €1 billion to now. €8.5 billion.. This is the result of the retained high earnings as well as currency effect, as you know, with. the change of the functional currency of our Bermuda subsidiary, we have increased the. U.S. dollar component in our capital and that is, of course, felt in the OCI and is the. decreasing interest rates in the first quarter we also had growing valuation reserves.. The book value per share reached a new all-time high of €70.68. Following three. consecutive years of low (03:40) major losses, very good results in the industries, the. property & casualty reinsurance market continues to see fierce competition with the. capacity exceeding the demand from ceding companies by quite a margin.. However, the amount of quality business you've seen so far towards the end of 2014 and. in 2015 has actually been a little bit better than we had expected. Although we continue to. adhere systematically to our selective underwriting approach, our Property & Casualty. business has grown on a gross premium basis, currency adjusted, by 13%. This is mainly. driven by new business from emerging markets, particularly China, the U.S. and also quite. significant growth on our agricultural business.. We also had a special effect with a more accurate estimating of premiums and our. accounting of the facultative business, which led to a non-recurring additional premium of. approximately €93 million for the first quarter. However, even eliminating the fact we were. able to grow the gross premium of our P&C business currency adjusted by about 8%.. This figure shows that we have made a highly successful start into the year 2015. With a. healthy operating profit of €255 million and a combined ratio of 95.7%, our Property &. Casualty business continues to be quite profitable. This is then particularly true as we. were able to keep with our conservative loss reserving policy also in the first quarter of. the current year.. We are thoroughly satisfied with the development of our Life & Health business. The. currency adjusted premium growth of around 7% is at the upper range of our target.. Opportunities presented themselves in the emerging markets in the Australian group. business as well as the block assumption transactions of our longevity business in. particular from the UK. The significant improved results show that the steps taken to. improve the profitability of our Australian (60:40) disability portfolio throughout to some. extent of our U.S. mortality business makes themselves felt.. On top of the good underlying profitability, we saw a significant additional profit of around. €39 million from termination fee of a financial solution transaction which had been booked. as a derivative and, therefore, will appear in the line of ordinary investment income.. Altogether, the operating profit showed a remarkable increase to reach €173 million, an. impressive increase of 165% compared with last year's figure.. We're also satisfied with the development of our investments. Also interest rates. continued to move lower. Our ordinary income from the fixed income securities as well as. our real estate portfolio had increased remarkably. This is on the back of large. shareholdings because also the invested assets have again increased significantly, not. least because of a continued very positive cash flow.. On that note, I will hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain to you these rather. good figures in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Okay. Good morning and thank, Uli. In the interest of time, I sort of immediately start with. Page 2. And as already mentioned, top line growth was notably ahead of our expectations. in the first quarter with regard to the very impressive currency exchange rate impact, one. has to bear in mind that premiums are translated on the basis of monthly rates and 2014. started into the year with a much stronger euro.. Net premium earned increased by 6.9% at unchanged FX rates that is slightly less than. the top line mainly due to our ILS activities and some fronting arrangements in the P&C. reinsurance segment.. Investment income, very satisfying benefiting from the positive one off in Life & Health. which Uli has already mentioned and which we will hear about at different occasions. Here,. the fee of around €40 million became payable, owing a customer-initiated withdrawal. from a financial solutions contract and due to the limited risk to the insurer as already. mentioned. This contract was booked in accordance with derivative accounting and,. thereby, is recognized within the investment income of the Life & Health division.. Other income and expenses benefited again from positive currency exchange rate effect,. this time mainly in the Life & Health reinsurance segment. Storm Niklas has hit Germany. and hereby especially E+S Rück, our German subsidiary. And on that basis, some of these. losses are borne by the minority shareholders, which is the reason for the positive swing. in the minority interest line.. The tax ratio is slightly above our expected level due to a rather conservative approach in. recognizing deferred tax liabilities, however, those who have already read our quarterly. report in detail might have found in the notes that we do expect a refund of past tax. payments in Q2, which should lead to a rather low tax rate in Q2, and, overall, the full year. tax rate should be in line or even a little bit below our expectations, and those were. usually around 25%.. If we look at the capital side, we have just recently announced the early redemption of a. €500 million perpetual bond on the 1 June 2015. Just as a reminder, we had already. refinanced this bond in September last year. So, therefore, the green part of this column. on the slide should be reduced in Q2 to a level that will likely be sustainable, and with that. also the interest claimants will of course be reduced in the future.. When it comes to shareholders' equity, last year's trend continued with an increase of. around 13% in the first quarter of 2015. Here, especially the OCI changes driven by the. asset valuations make our life more difficult when it comes to ROE achievements. Before –. the background, the actual achievement of 13.9% is, from my own point of view, even. more remarkable.. Cash flow continues to be very positive, mainly fueled by the premium growth of our. reinsurance business. And it also, of course, includes currency exchange rate effects. But. also, the investment income has contributed.. Assets under own management further increased by 9.5% to a level of close to €40. billion, in the meantime. The impact of currency exchange rates here, in particular, the. USD was around €2.5 billion within that numbers. Rising valuations reserves had a positive. impact of around €260 million in the first quarter of 2015.. On the P&C side of life, the gross premium increased by a remarkable 13% on an FXadjusted basis. Uli already mentioned the special effects of the changed recognition of. pipeline premium in the facultative business. Here, we have enhanced our accounting. system to calculate more accurately what we call the pipeline premium, which is the. premium already earned, but for which we have not yet received cedant accounts. This. effect accounts for 5 percentage points of the reported growth for the first quarter and. this is expected to normalize over the next quarters.. At 3.3% of the net premium earned major losses, again very well below the budget in the. first quarter. The underwriting result is again on a very good level. The combined ratio of. 95.7% is below the full year maximum target of 96%. With the very positive overall result. in mind and in line with our practice employed in the past, we did not release the unused. large loss budget, but capped (14:37) it for the remainder of the year.. We did also not benefit from other positive run-off results in the first quarter of 2015, plus. we have kept our reserving methodology unchanged. All in all, this means that we should. have kept our confidence level at minimum stable, and the absolute amounts of. redundant reserves should have been increased one more time.. The very low inflation level has had a negative impact on the investment income, but. other than that, the ordinary investment income and also realized gains were in line with. expectations. Other income and expenses in this segment are on a similar level. compared to last year. All together, net income from our P&C business stands at €171. million, very satisfying even if a little bit below a very good previous quarter or Q1 2014.. On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed good underwriting. profitability. Continental Europe was mainly affected by Storm Niklas at the very end of this. quarter, while aviation was impacted by the Germanwings loss, plus a few single losses. which did not make it over the large loss threshold, but still added to the negative. combined ratio effect. Marine is only slightly above the MtCR. This can be explained by the. increased basic losses in the first quarter and a cargo ship carrying rather expensive cars. that went aground in January, but didn't really make it to a single large loss. Not. surprisingly, the profitability of our global cat business was very good due to the absence. of the cat losses.. I think we can go through the next slides rather quickly, because as already mentioned,. major losses well below the average in the budget. Still, the year has only just begun.. Three losses made it on to our large loss list, apart from the already mentioned events,. the winter storm in the U.S. just crossed the €10 million threshold and, overall, the bulk of. our €95 million in unused budget as already mentioned has been carried forward for the. remainder of the year as IBNR.. With currency adjusted growth of 6.5%, the premium development as well as the growing. business segments in our Life & Health business lines us very much in line with our targets.. The important message here is that the underlying profitability has improved as we had. expected.. On top of this improvement, the result benefited from the already mentioned one-off. effect in the ordinary investment income as well as the occurrence of positive currency. exchange rate effects in other income and expenses. Overall, this results in a remarkable. operating profit of €173 million for the first quarter.. This excellent result is also reflected in the EBIT margins for our reporting currencies,. which all outperformed their respective targets with the financial solutions segment, of. course, benefiting also from the run-off. But even without these non-recurring items. profitability, it was very, very positive. As a sideline, the effect from our ModCo derivatives. was around zero in the first quarter.. Looking at the investments, I'm quite satisfied with the results of the first quarter 2015. despite the low-yield environment or even lower-yield environment. And excluding the. special effect in the Life & Health segment, the ordinary investment in turn is still above. the last year's level based on the increased asset volume. Of course, this development is. also supported by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.. Mainly as a result of regular portfolio maintenance realized gains were on a lower, but still. remarkable level. Depreciations were again only on a very, very low level, consisting for. the most part of regular depreciation from our increasing real estate portfolio.. Excluding the effects of the technical derivatives, meaning ModCo and inflation swaps, the. ROI from assets under own management was 3.5%, clearly above the expectation and. leaving us well placed to achieve our target for the full year. If we adjust that for the oneoff, the ROI would have been 3.2%, still clearly above the target of exactly 3%.. Moreover, we have switched our targeted inflation protection from swaps to inflationlinked bonds. And our last tranche of the swaps is maturing in the second quarter. So in. the future, this should mitigate the artificial volatility we have seen from these instruments. in the past.. Our asset allocation is almost unchanged and for this reason, you can find the respective. slide in the appendix to these presentations. And again, in the interest of time, I would. conclude my remarks here and leave the rest to Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. It's a pleasure for me this quarter to present the target matrix. because, for a change, all targets have been achieved, which is evident of a very good. first quarter 2015. This also suggests that we have laid a good foundation for achieving. our full-year targets.. Therefore, I will move directly to the outlook on the next slide. We have actually been. quite satisfied with the renewals at 1st of April on the P&C side where business in Japan is. traditionally renewed, and alongside with that, some business from Australia and New. Zealand, as well as part of the U.S. property catastrophe and some other U.S. business. In. addition, also some of our agricultural business was up for renewal. Overall, we recorded. a premium growth of 5%, which, of course, as always is on a currency-adjusted basis. And. we achieved that without making concessions to our underwriting discipline.. This increase is actually largely driven by some new business that we wrote in the U.S.. where we actually managed to write some quite attractive new short-tail treaty. Also in. Japan, we managed to increase our volume to some extent, and that is despite the fact. that on the property catastrophe business, we saw continued pressure on the rates.. In personal accident and property per risk, the price declines were for the most part. actually quite small, and based of some losses in the past, on the casualty business, we. indeed actually saw some increases. Overall, we managed to improve our provision,. particularly some of our core clients and this is the reason that the opportunities that we. at Hannover Re saw in the Japanese market have actually been quite positive at this. renewal.. On the property catastrophe in the U.S., we saw the – it's too difficult for me to say. expected decrease, but nonetheless, it's a decrease of 5% to 10%. We saw another. increasing showing of that business to Hannover Re and, therefore, due to some business. reason, the premium volume actually increased slightly at 5% that actually rates have. come down. But we continue to underwrite rates which meet our requirement for being. well excess the expected loss plus expenses plus cost of capital.. Given the result of the first quarter, largely supporting our guidance, we have left the. guidance more or less unchanged. This, however, is no entirely true for the expected. growth because the successful start in the year, which will, of course, have continued. effects on the premiums booked in the later quarters, we are now more confident that. actually we will achieve an increase of our volume, both in Property & Casualty as well as in. Life & Health.. We left the target of 875% (sic) [€875 million] (25:30) for the profits for the entire year. unchanged despite the fact that we have made quite a way in the first quarter, but the. year is long and lots of things can happen. So, we felt it will be prudent to keep that. guidance unchanged for the time being.. Well the dividend, you can see is our normal 35% to 40%. This allows us, of course, to. finance our inspired growth internally. However, if the market remains unchanged and the. capital develops as we have seen in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, of course, higher. dividends are actually quite likely.. Looking at the individual areas of our Property & Casualty business, we are quite confident. that we will still be able to achieve margins above the cost of capital and this is despite. the intensive competition. However, we have seen that our Property & Casualty practice is. positioned to be successful even in this rather competitive phase of the market.. We see potential for further growth, in particular, in North America and Asia-Pacific, but. also in our facultative business and, in particular, our structured reinsurance business and. we, it's already certain, we'll see quite remarkable growth of our agricultural business.. While the volume, the arrows you see here is a little bit more positive because they are. not on a currency adjusted basis. So, a large part of those arrows are actually currency.. On the Life & Health business, similarly, we expect 2015 will be better than 2014 and. overall, can see a very good result. You can see that we expect negative premium growth. on our financial solutions business, however, premium on financial solutions is not that. decisive because a lot of the transactions are actually booked on a deposit basis. And. even as we have observed to some extent as a derivative therefore are not shown up in. the premium line at all. On the financial solution business, of course, it's the most. important development of the bottom line. And here, we are very confident that we will. see a very impressive growth in 2015.. The areas of longevity business we expect to grow. I mean, there's a continued demand. of tailor-made solutions which actually allow us to grow that business. Mortality business,. despite the continued negative repercussion from our ING portfolio, overall actually, it's. quite profitable. And for the morbidity business, we see improvements in Australia. particularly in the group business due to the significant rate increase.. Therefore, all in all, we are quite positive on our Life & Health business for the current. year. This slide looks familiar to you because it really shows where we see the strength of. Hannover Re and the current competitive business that reinsurance presents for us in. challenging investment environment. And this is actually quite continuous for the last. couple of years.. For the Life & Health business, I think, a lot has been said. Needless to say that it is quite. gratifying that we see increased profits from our Life & Health business at a time when we. see a lot of pressure on the P&C business from competition as the diversification works. well here. As for as the Property & Casualty business is consumed, our franchise is intact.. We, in our position as one of the large multinational, multi-line (30:47) reinsurers see. good opportunities on that business, and we can also that way safeguard the quality of. our business.. So far, we also could keep the very conservative loss reserving policy as the result overall. has been good. And that gives us quite a reassuring buffer also into the coming year.. Investment income, cash flow continues to be positive. We continue to keep the absolute. return on a stable level as the relative returns there on investments, 3%. We actually are a. little bit better than that. So, overall, the story is intact.. On that note ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation covering the. start, which was actually quite good into 2015 and we will be more than happy to answer. your questions.. Q&A. Operator. The first question comes from Mr. In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead,. sir.. In-Yong Hwang. Hello. Hi. In-Yong from Goldman Sachs. Two questions from me. The first one is on the. very strong non-life growth, you mentioned some of the segment spectrum and also if. you could give us a bit more detail around that and in particular what kind of strength that. Hannover you think is allowing you to grow so much in such a challenging environment?. And the second question is on kind of capital management. We're seeing continuous high. level of unrealized gains that is still going up. But I think that's where you will consider. capital money (33:10) always starts to go towards the 13% if that's kind of (33:15) the. same or does the high level of unrealized gains change that somewhat here?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, for the non-life growth, I mean, it's always a case that there are a lot of projects. where we are working on new business. So far, this year, the hit ratio where we actually. came to a conclusion has been relatively high. I mean we have particularly written some. new business, which we feel is actually quite attractive in China. This is largely on a. proportional basis, and it's kind of on a whole account basis of our Chinese cedants.. We also, last year, had underwritten a model of quota share which was actually premiumheavy. And, originally, we expected that to vanish because these things come and go, but. we managed to renew it for another year. So that is the reason for that.. Growth, I mean, I was just talking about the Japanese renewal where we managed. actually to improve our market position, and, therefore, on attractive business, which we. were looking to write larger shares, so we actually were able to do so. Then there are. continued flow of business there. The specific needs of our clients may be in conjunction. with acquisitions who are entering new lines where support of reinsurance can be helpful. and if you have a rather broad client base, we are contacted on these opportunities quite. regularly.. Of course, the hit ratio is sometimes not very large because of our margin requirement.. But so far, this year, we have been reasonably successful. Of course, there are few others. in the pipeline, but again, I mean, the ink needs to be dry before you can really say. something more definitive.. On the agriculture business, we also brought significant new business both – I mean, into. developed North America as well as in Asia, notably India. There is a reason for that. remarkable growth. I mean, but it's also growth that you probably can gather which to. some extent is the result of a more bulky transaction that we write.. As far as the capital management is concerned, of course, we have our AGM today and. we will I mean, propose to the AGM to pay a dividend of €4.25 which, of course, reduces. the capital in the second quarter. That is still on the agenda, despite the unrealized gains. on – as part of the capital. Therefore, I said, I mean, that it's not yet unlikely that we may. also pay a special dividend for 2015 should results allow, and capital markets be. unchanged in their trend. So, I mean, on the subject of share buybacks with our majority of. shareholder, it's a little bit more challenging. Does that answer the question?. In-Yong Hwang. Yes. Yes. That's very clear. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Frank Kopfinger from Commerzbank.. Please go ahead, sir.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your FX. effects. Could you please explain why they only hit your Life Re segment in the other. income and not the Non-Life segment as well?. And my second question is also, could you update us on your current reinvestment yields. and also whether you'll change your strategy going forward? And also given your strong. capitalization, whether there is some intention to put some more capital into risk or to rerisk your investments?. Ulrich Wallin. I think, Roland, this one's for you.. Roland Vogel. Yes. With regards to the FX, you know that our policy would be to always be matched and. welcome than negatives. Still, the overall approach would be a matched approach.. That is not always possible because and I think I've explained that before, you have to. decide which balance sheet you match, either the economic or the IFRS for the group, for. the single company, or the German GAAP so you have to compromise here.. And in that regard, it is very often – you could see unmanageable to be matched to 100%.. Here, the likelihood that we are a little bit long in the U.S. dollar was a little bit higher in the. life subsidiaries and the segments. So this is more or less by chance that these effects. have occurred on the Life side.. Ulrich Wallin. And if I may add, of course, in the first quarter the softening of the euro was actually quite. dramatic I would say, due to the quantitative easing of CZB (39:48).. Roland Vogel. So the leverage of any even not very high mismatch which might be unavoidable has. been rather high within that one quarter.. So with regards to the reinvestment yields, I think I present them twice a year. The math, it. should be around 1.6% I would assume. I haven't seen an update this year – this week. We. have not really dramatically changed. We're still looking for more investments on the real. estate side. We are looking at opportunities here or there.. You know that 60% of our assets are outside the euro, which helps at least to a certain. extent. Other than that, we have not changed our investment strategy. And we still expect. if the yields stay where they are, that we lose around 15 basis points per year as ROI for. the portfolio. Up to now, our expectations that this should be mitigated by higher volumes. have – but still realized so there is not a real new story here.. Frank Kopfinger. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. William Hawkins from Keefe, Bruyette &. Woods. Please go ahead, sir.. William Hawkins. Hello. Thank you very much. Could you just give a bit more detail about the life margins,. the remarkable figures you mentioned? Because I'm just trying to understand, when. we've got a material beat in longevity and mortality and morbidity as well versus your. budget, is that all kind of FX or are there other common things that are worth. commenting on or is this normal quarterly volatility?. Again, I'm just a bit confused about whether to say that this is a great beat and it's. sustainable and I should annualize it or if you just had a lucky quarter and in future. quarters, I should be back to your targets, so the strength outside of the one-off that. you've clearly flagged.. And then secondly, how do you want me to interpret the increase in the non-life. combined ratio year-on-year? To what extent is that business mix and to what extent is. that occurring because of pricing? I thought what you said about the reserving and the. rest of it. I'm just trying to get a feel what I should conclude by that visible increase yearon-year. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if I come to the life margins, I mean, I would say that you will continue to see higher. high margins because really it's a lot of financing of statutory reserves. I mean, if you call. it, out of the money stop losses where you would, of course, expect low premium for the. most part or premium equal to the profits. And that business, there is a little bit of a firstmover advantage particularly in the U.S we have seen grown quite nicely.. Also in the segment of financial solutions, we have the large morbidity treaty which had a. lot of premium, but very slim margin, if any, and as we discontinue that, you will see. premiums come down. But, of course, the margins increase.. On the longevity business, that is not really currency because – I mean, from the currency. – the claims and the premiums really are quite well aligned when they are booked. I would. say on the margins, on the longevity business will – a little bit high in this quarter, which has. to do with the enhanced annuity, but they will probably for the entire year will be more like. a 2% to 3%.. On the morbidity business, I mean, margins sustainable will be higher than in previous. years mainly due to the rate increases on the Australian group business that a lot of that. premium comes from and that on the DII business in Australia, which was the other source. of losses in 2013 we strengthened the reserves quite remarkable, and that seems to. hold.. Therefore, I mean, we are relatively positive on the development of the profitability of our. Life & Health business even though, I mean, you cannot multiply the break fee by four. because it is quite unlikely that we will have similar break fees in the coming quarters.. As well as – as far as the non-life combined ratio is referred to, well, I mean, I don't think. that's a major mix in the business. I mean, of course, it's determined by the loss ratio pick. for the more recent underwriting years the fact that we keep the unused large loss. budget in reserve, and the fact that is what kind of development from previous years you. have. As there has been no release of loss reserves from previous years you can see a. rather pure figure here. Rather pure figure taking into account the – actually the large. losses at the expected level.. With that, I would say we are relatively satisfied if it comes in below 96%. I mean in theory,. result in the first quarter. I mean, one thing which is of course a question we ask ourselves. all the time, when will we reduce rates, and we've seen reduced rates at least twice,. has not been the case as yet in the first quarter as far as we can see.. Thank you.. The next question comes from Mr. Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.. Thomas Fossard. Yes, good morning. One question. Going back to the (47:28) on growth actually in Q1 in. the P&C Re segment. I just wanted, Ulrich, you to comment a bit more on these short-tail. opportunities you're seeing in the U.S. markets. So, it seems to be pretty much under. pressure for the time being due to capacity. So, I'm quite interesting to better understand. where these short-tail opportunities are coming from.. And also, if you can comment a bit more on the agro business, because it seems to be. that for a lot of guys like you, not only Hannover Re, but in general, agro business is a. significant source of business opportunities. So, could you comment about on that if there. is any potential (48:11) regulation or anything like that? And more generally speaking, could. you update us now on how much is the agro business for the total group and what are the. main geographical exposures? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. When we come to the short-tail business we were mentioning. I mean, these are. business opportunities mostly actually on not industrial lines, but personal lines of small to. medium commercial. And, I mean, they are surrounding accumulation management of. catastrophe exposure with our client. And they are partly also, I mean, capital. management resultant. So, I mean, to that extent, there are opportunities that come and. go really. It just depends on the regions, necessities of our clients and beginning of the. year was just a few of those arose that we could achieve our margins and after significant. I mean, another big block of our property business is, of course, our property per risk. account. Prices are on a pressure there, but the rate reductions are, I would say, single. digit to the lower end rather than the high end. We have – I mean, particularly in the U.S.,. we are the lead market on that and we have – historically had very god margins because. again on that for the most part it's a very well diversified book, which is not that much. based on the heavy industrial business. And that business actually, we feel that at the. current rates, we still have sufficient margins, so we are looking for new business still and. also, of course, defending what we've got and we have been quite successful with that.. On the agricultural business, I mean, there is increased demand, particularly in China and. India, which we are benefiting from. Historically, we were heavily underweight in North. America and heavily overweight in Latin America. We still have very attractive portfolio in. Latin America, but we have accretively large market share. But we have increased our. involvement in the – particularly in the U.S., following the drop that we had a couple of. years ago. We felt that margins got a little bit better and so we got a little bit more active. there and that's where particularly in 2015, we have seen, I mean, significant growth. But. this is really, I mean, one or two new transactions which are quite large and makes. themselves felt.. I think, if you look at our overall volume on the agricultural business this year, we could. reach, I would say close to $500 million. So, it becomes an important part of our P&C. business. A little bit gratifying that we had also good profitability last year because that is. the big challenge on the agricultural business. It is a challenge for that business to be. profitable. So, we have to be very diligent when we underwrite it.. Does that answer the question?. Thomas Fossard. Thank you very much.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go. ahead, sir.. Kamran Hossain. Good Morning. Two questions. The first one is on capital. You sound – I mean, earlier in the. Q&A, you sound very – highly confident that you should be in a surplus capital position at. the year-end. Could you – I mean, unless we've got a massive (52:51) in between now and. then, which is Solvency III. Could you just give us a quick update on where you stand on. Solvency II and whether you see any kind of other potential major impacts on your capital. position between now and then?. And the second question is just on M&A. I know you talking about this in the past. valuations were a bit right. But is it happening at the moment given kind of a renewed. focus on maybe growing the top line where the business is attractive that this is. something that you might consider? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. As far as the surplus capital goals and Solvency II, I mean we have hired our internal capital. model for Hannover Re subgroup with our regulator in Germany and that looks to the. extent you can be sure when you talk with regulators quite positive, I would say. So, I. mean, from that point of view, in 2016 as the, I mean, legal capital adequacy should be. very comfortable, I would say, well in access of 200%.. So from that point of view, I mean excess capital is not a question. We still have the. constraints of the rating agencies, which – I mean we have got our capital model is a little. bit more precise for our business than theirs. That is still a slightly higher challenge.. However, also as their situation looks quite comfortable. So from that point of view, even. taking into account the necessary buffer, we are relatively confident, actually very. confident that we will have sufficient and even more than sufficient capital by year-end.. M&A activities, yes, I mean, we have constantly looking for M&A activities. We also have a. few targets in lines that could be very attractive for us. Unfortunately for the most part,. they are not for sale at this point in time or very expensive. Therefore, on large M&A. activities, there currently no hot topic or hot project that we are working at, I would say.. But, I mean, of course, we would always be interested in – if we find targets that can. improve our overall business profile, that would most likely go into the direction of a. practice in this lines of specialty insurance.. Roland Vogel. line growth again. I don't see that. Even if we have been growing in the first quarter more. than expected, we have not comprised our margin requirements or whatever, and we are. still prepared to not grow in case the business is not profitable. So there is no readjusted. focus on top line.. Kamran Hossain. That's very clear. Thanks very much.. Operator. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Research. Please go ahead.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. I've actually – just two sort of clarifications from William's questions earlier. I'm not. sure when you talked about the margin in mortality and morbidity business, which is 8.1%. in Q1 versus the target of 6% you were suggesting that part of that is because of the. repricing that occurred in Australia. Are you saying then that the 6% target is sort of out of. date now? And given the repricing, should we be accustomed to a higher target? I mean,. within the target of 6%, this can (57:32) with your ROE targets. So, maybe just to clarify, is. there an – was it really just quite a benign experience in Q1 or is there a structural. reexamination of that margin we need to think about?. And the second question, again clarifying, you said you were looking all the time to see if. there would be a margin erosion coming through in non-life because of the (57:57) of. weaker pricing. You said that you haven't seen it yet. So the underlying margin. deterioration in non-life when we allow for the fact that you've got to fully (58:08) a. normal budget (58:10) losses this year and last year is what then? It's just mix effects? And. when do you think you will start to see some underlying margin and erosion through?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean, firstly, the margin from the morbidity business. Of course, for the morbidity. business, they have historically been for the most part below 6% while mortality was. about 6%. I mean, on the Australian group business, the current margins are we above. 6%. However, I mean, there is already reoccurring competition for that business arriving in. that market because, I mean, as the overall reinsurance market is soft and people see. signs of improvement in that business, of course, there is immediately a renewed interest. in that class.. So for us, it's obviously a little bit important that we are, I mean, not waiting until the. improvement is actually seen, but are already involved in the improvement happening into. the Australian group business. That looks well for us, of course, only if there's higher. margins that we think we have now actually materialize itself in the longer time.. So I wouldn't say that – and I think that the 6% is still a good guidance for mortality and. morbidity combined and it's still a hurdle which is not that easy to constantly develop that. far. Despite the fact, again, also that the new business that we write, the margins that we. calculate are above that figure. But of course, I mean, actually to expect that also we have. to take them into account. But as I said, I mean, this, getting the problem areas. continuously better under control, we expect that the margins on our Life & Health. business will increase.. On the non-life.... Andrew J. Ritchie. And the 6% is consistent with the ROE target generally, is it right?. Ulrich Wallin. Andrew J. Ritchie. Yes. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. I mean, if you go to the non-life business, I'm absolutely certain that the reduced rate. eventually will make it felt in the underlying loss ratios. I mean, it's a little bit maybe. prolonged because of the continued very, very low inflation rate, but that is no way that. you can reduce the rates three years in a row and still hope that will not be shown, it will. not be seen in your combined ratios and loss ratios in, fact.. That's why we are so protective of our buffers on the loss reserves, because we expect. that we will actually need I mean part of that in the coming years. And, therefore, every. year like 2014 or the first quarter of 2015, we can continue to reserve very conservative in. the current market environment on the P&C side it's bonus for us.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. So, what you are saying is obviously the deterioration we saw on an underlying basis. year-on-year is kind of partly prior year noise, partly mix noise, really, not margin yet?. Roland Vogel. No, this is not margin. It's really based on nurturing our reserve buffer.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. The next question comes from Anasuya Iyer from Jefferies. Please go ahead.. Anasuya Iyer. Oh hi. My question is just coming back to capital. At the Investor Day last year, you gave us. €1 billion number for your excess capital allowing for rating agency. Do you have an update. on that given how the capital has moved since then?. And also how should I think about the usage of that capital especially given the growth. opportunities that you're saying are now in Australia and large volume treaties? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, we haven't got an update on the excess capital because we haven't yet calculated it. on the Q1 figures which, of course, I mean the capital clearly has increased, but with the. increased volume, also the capital requirement would have increased. So, we have to see. there that we come out there. I mean, use of that capital is still a challenge, I would say.. Yes, we have seen a good opportunity at the beginning of the year, but still the market. overall is relatively soft. So, I mean, that will be a little bit back and forth.. So, I mean we are still not in a position where we could use the capital without significantly. changing the volatility of the earnings. We, of course, could use the capital by – I mean,. significantly increasing our natural catastrophe risk appetite because we seem to be in the. position to write more natural catastrophe business if we want, or we could increase this. risk on our investment portfolio, for example, by, I mean, investing in equities.. However, we still see higher value to keep the volatility of our earnings to a lower level in. the current phase because we are still relatively satisfied with the absolute level of our. earnings, and therefore, from that volatility perspective, we could use the capital while. increasing the volatility. We still more like to keep our powder dry to times and the. opportunities are better.. Roland Vogel. And maybe from my side to the capital models of the rating agencies, I think I would. endorse what Uli indicated here. We have seen an increase in the capital position. So the. adjusted capital is higher. But also we have seen the drivers, the currency exchange rate. plus also the increase in the premiums which do get additional capital charge. So I would. assume and the first calculations would confirm that the position has not changed. drastically when it comes to the excess position.. Anasuya Iyer. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Thank you. There are no further questions. I hand over to the speakers.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you very much for listening in to this rather early call for us this quarter. And I. wish you all a very nice day, and thank you very much.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being concluded. You may now disconnect.",20150506_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2015-5-6_FS000000002212304783.pdf,2015-05-06
3,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to today's Hannover Re International. conference call on interim results (technical difficulty). For your information, this conference. is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today Mr.. Ulrich Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you. Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining the. Hannover RE conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO Roland Vogel and we are. pleased to present to you the figures for the first half-year 2016. With a net income of. EUR486 million, the business development in the first half-year supports the full-year. guidance. However, the Second Quarter on a standalone basis did not perform quite as. well as expected. In addition to a high level of large losses in the quarter, we also saw a. spike in the frequency of the underlying losses and some reserve increases on loss. reserves from previous years.. As a result, the combined ratio for the quarter was 96.1%, somewhat higher than. expected. Despite the fact that the combined ratio benefited from reserve releases over. and above the level of the normally expected run of profit. Roland will dwell on this in. more detail.. In addition, the tax rate for the quarter and indeed the half-year has been a little higher. than normally because the majority of the losses from the Canadian wildfires impacted. the results of our P&C subsidiary in Bermuda.. The premium income developed much in line with expectation considering the soft P&C. reinsurance market with a slight reduction of the gross written premiums and some. modest growth of the net earned premiums. Despite the fact that we have paid EUR573. million in dividend to our shareholders, the Second Quarter saw the shareholders' equity. nonetheless increase by 4.4%. This to a large extent was due to the interest rates. dropping even further following the Brexit vote in the UK and thus boosting the unrealized. gains on the balance sheet. Naturally, this puts the ROE under some pressure but at 11.8%,. it still remains above the minimum target.. Having already commented on the property and casualty reinsurance business, I would. like to add something on the life and health results for the first half-year. These results. have been quite solid. We have seen growth in particular from our UK longevity business. which more than offset the premiums lost from some larger single premium transactions. which we have not renewed. As a result, the premiums, both gross and net, saw some. growth.. The underlying earnings of the business have developed quite favorable. However, we. continue to see some negative claims experience from yearly renewable term business. from some older underwriting years of our US mortality business. We deal with this. problem by increasing rates where necessary and appropriate.. The results from our investments under management are fully in line with expectations. with an ROI of 2.9%. On this note, I will hand over to Roland our CFO who will explain the. figures to you in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Good morning, thank you, Ulrich. And as usual I will focus on the half-year figures and try. to keep my comments as brief as possible. However, I think in some cases further. explanations to the quarterly development might be useful this time. The slight decrease. in the top line is in line with our expectations for the full year especially in light of the. strong growth we recorded in the previous year. Net income increased favorably by 4.5%.. As already explained on the occasion of our Q1 conference call, the main reason for this. seemingly contradictory development is the change in unearned premium, the retention. actually only increased marginally.. Investment income in line with our expectation and excluding the EUR39 million positive. on; off effect in life and health reinsurance in Q1 2015, investment income from assets. under own management is on the level of the previous year, which can be seen I think as. a success in the current yield environment.. Other income and expenses decreased mainly due to less positive effects -- currency. effects -- in the life and health reinsurance. However, we are still in positive territory here.. At 27.5% the tax ratio was slightly higher than in the previous year. Ulrich mentioned that. mainly due to a less positive result from our subsidiaries in Bermuda. Even if we assume. that large losses will exhaust the budget also by year-end, we expect that to level out to. some extent for the full year.. Shareholders' equity increased by 4.4% despite paying dividends of (EUR573 million). (corrected by company after the call) in the Second Quarter. And on the right-hand side of. this slide you can see that especially the capital contribution from valuation reserves in our. investments increased by nearly EUR600 million as a result of interest rates declining. even further and thereby overcompensating the dividend payment.. With realized gains only slightly above last year's, we did not harvest from such. extraordinary gains and this unforeseeable effects here in the first half. On the one hand,. of course improves the capital strength of the Company even more. On the other hand, it. had diluted the ROE by nearly 50 basis points. Of course, this development should also. have a positive effect on our already high solvency ratio going forward.. Cash flow continues to be very positive in the first half year. You might remember that. some EUR500 million received from the Chinese financial solution treaty inflated last. year's cash flow. And EUR300 million from that amount have now been forwarded to Re. concessionaires in the First Quarter of this yea hence depressing the formally reported. number for operating cash flow. Excluding this effect and as demonstrated on this slide,. cash flow for the first half of 2016 was again over and above EUR1 billion positive and with. that fully in line with expectations.. Assets under own management increased by 1% to a level close to EUR50 billion -EUR40 billion, sorry. Increased valuation reserves had a positive effect of around EUR850. million while there was a negative impact from the currency exchange rates effect on the. hand and that was around EUR550 million.. As a result of our strict margin-oriented underwriting approach, P&C gross premium. decreased by 5.6% on an FX-adjusted basis. Please bear in mind that we have been. growing strongly in 2015 and that the previous year's premium was additionally influenced. by a non-recurring effect associated with the accounting of our facultative business where. we booked almost EUR100 million in premium -- in additional premium last year.. Moreover, we scaled back our involvement in Chinese motor business as well as in our. specialty lines., particularly in aviation where rates no longer justify a continued. participation.. Nevertheless, net earned premium was stable on an FX adjusted basis as mentioned but. is not the result of a higher retention, which actually decreased slightly. But it is due to the. change in unearned premium driven by the strong growth in 2015.. As you all know, following a very benign First Quarter, the loss activity increased. remarkably at 9.2% of net premium income. The budget for the first half year was almost. entirely exhausted. And in the standalone Second Quarter we actually recorded the. highest net loss -- large loss expenditures for an individual quarter since the First Quarter. of 2011. The budget was therefore clearly exceeded on a standalone basis; however, this. was compensated for by the unused portion of the large loss budget from the First. Quarter.. Moreover, also the frequency of various smaller claims was higher than expected in. various lines of business around the world. This development was mitigated by an overall. higher-than-usual positive run-off result. Here we, on the one hand saw some negative. run-offs from single claims also but these were more than offset by positive reserve. developments, particularly in marine. Some cases developed very favorably and also the. expected ultimate loss ratios could be taken down.. And as you will remember, the expected regular positive run-off result is around EUR50. million plus per quarter in the first half-year. This amount was exceeded by around EUR150. million and with that more than mitigating the negative developments I've mentioned. before.. Over the course of the year, of course, we do not have a fully-fledged reserve analysis. available. But we should expect that the positive run-off result has slightly affected the. confidence level of loss reserves downwards as compared to year-end 2015. We will. publish the final numbers of the reserve study for 2015 at the occasion of our Investors. Day in October as usual. But with the increase of redundant reserves we have. experienced by the end of 2015, it is fair to say that even with the potential reduction of. this year, we should still be remarkably above the level we had published last year. You. might remember these were EUR1.56 billion and again we should still be remarkably over. that number.. Ordinary investment income was in line with expectations. Total net investment income. decreased only slightly. I will explain the reason for this development when it comes to the. details of the investment income in a few minutes.. The tax rate increased compared to last year mainly as a result of less positive results. from Bermuda. As already mentioned, this should not come as a surprise considering the. significant cat losses in Q2. Altogether, with an EBIT margin of more than 14.6%, the P&C. segment performed still satisfactorily in the light of a still changing market environment.. As already mentioned, the large loss situation was exactly in line with budget for the first. half year even though the loss occurrence is distributed quite unevenly between the first. and the Second Quarter. The important message after the extraordinarily high large. losses in the Second Quarter is that our budget for the second half year of 2016, which. amounts to EUR472 million, is fully available, which is somewhat reassuring given that the. Atlantic hurricane season has just begun.. After six months, 11 major losses are showing up on the large loss list. They include. significant events. Also on the nat cat as well as on the manmade side -- sorry. With a net. loss of EUR132 million, the wildfires in Canada were by far the largest loss in the first half. year and at our Q1 results we had already flagged the fact that Hannover RE has a. particularly high market share in Ecuador and accordingly the net loss from the earthquake. there is EUR57 million for our own account.. Looking at the overall numbers, it's good to see that our retrocession protection is. working well, resulting in a relief of around EUR140 million.. Looking at the technical profitability of our P&C book by lines of business, the combined. ratio in marine is, as already mentioned, outstanding. Here I already mentioned the. positive ru; off of reserves at roughly EUR50 million in total in the Second Quarter.. Combined with an overall favorable loss situation this led to this remarkable combined. ratio of just 12%.. So our business for North American in particular contributes favorably very -- or very. positively to our results. The cat XL combined ratio is now over and above the MtCR. having been especially hit hard by the wildfires in Canada.. The earthquake loss in Ecuador on the other hand is mainly accounted under worldwide. treaty business hence explaining the rather high combined ratio in this segment.. Credit and surety was mainly affected by one large claim and it's still good to see that. with all these effects, the P&C portfolio as a whole remains to perform lower than. maximum tolerable combined ratio overall.. With currency-adjusted growth of 4.6% in the top line, development of our life and health. business is even a bit above expectations for the -- for the first half year. Q4 and -- Q3. and Q4 2015 have been particularly strong in last year. So this increase might be slightly. lower by the year-end.. The growth is mainly driven by continued demand in UK longevity. Net premium earned. increased remarkably by almost 10% adjusted for currency effects. The increased. retention is reflecting first and foremost, the reduced gross premium volume from a large. contract in Australia for which we had previously bought significant retrocession. protection.. Adjusted for the EUR39 million positive one-off effect in the previous year, the EBIT for. the first half-year 2016 would have increased compared to 2015 and, well, this is still in line. with our overall expectations for 2016.. Really already -- as Ulrich already mentioned the result from our US mortality business is. again somewhat below our expectation with mortality higher than anticipated. Apart from. that, the measures we had implemented with regards to a reduction in collateral costs. and in rate increases for selected underperforming treaties, well, these measures have. materialized as expected.. Our financial solution business continues to show excellent profitability with an EBIT. margin of more than 16%. Longevity is satisfactory with an EBIT margin slightly above the. 2% target. And as explained, the somewhat unfavorable development in the US mortality. experience is the main reason for the miss in mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, the. 4.3% figure is still an improvement as compared to 2015.. Ordinary investment income also here was in line with our expectation. The net effect. from our ModCo derivative was a negative EUR1.6 billion -- million of course -- sorry million. -- in the first half year.. Looking at the investments, the development is very satisfactory. Investment income. exactly in line with our expectation. A decrease in ordinary investment income is due to. the last year's one-off effect from the termination fee in life and health. Realization, I. mentioned that before, only slightly above last year's level with the majority driven by. structural changes within our private equity portfolio. In line with our investment strategy. as a hold-to-maturity fixed income investor, we did not harvest sharply increased. unrealized gains on our fixed income portfolio which is up by more than EUR850 million. since the beginning of the year.. As a result of the volatility of the equity market of the volatile -- sorry, the volatile equity. markets following the Brexit referendum, we had some impairments on individual stocks. within our equity portfolio. In total, that amounts to EUR25 million. As you know, we had. made a moderate start into building up a diversified equity portfolio in 2015. And we. continued this in January -- in 2016. Looking at our equity portfolio as a whole also. including the write-downs, the development is actually positive. So also here, we have. built up valuation reserves as a buffer for future volatility.. Overall investment return was 2.9%, exactly the return we are targeting for the full year,. even in light of the reduced investment yields we have to face right now.. The next slide shows an overview of how the different asset classes contributed to the. ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand side,. you can see that we have kept our asset allocation rather stable. When it comes to new. investments, we are still following a strategy of investing in highly liquid government. bonds in combination with some higher yielding bonds while maintaining an overall stable. risk appetite as we think that an increased liquidity overall is helpful in the volatile market. environment.. At 39%, corporates have still by far the highest share in our investment income. Real. estate and private equity are contributing significantly more than their respective share in. the asset allocation.. I think this should conclude my remarks and I leave the target matrix as always to you. Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Well the target matrix you can see that beside the prevailing difficult. trading conditions, we continue to see ticks on almost all of our profitability targets. The. premium income, however, developed short of our growth targets, particular in property. and casualty reinsurance business because of our selective underwriting approach during. the current soft market.. This slide -- this shows you the renewals throughout the year of our P&C book excluding. our facultative business, our structured reinsurance business as well as our ILS business.. You can see during the Second Quarter 16% of the traditional P&C reinsurance business is. up for renewal. In absolute terms, it's (EUR1.5 billion) (corrected by company after the call).. You may recall that for January 1 renewals we saw a decline of our premiums of 1.5%. followed by a rise of our premiums in the Second Quarter -- Third Quarter renewals of. 9.1%. And as you will see on the next slide, the Second Quarter renewals saw a growth of. 8% meaning that on a year-to-date basis and on -- based on constant exchange rate -we saw renewal premiums increase by EUR101 million equal to 1.6%.. This slide shows you the details of the Second Quarter renewals and as you can see -- I. mean there is that 8% increase despite the fact that the market in general has continued. to be soft. This in fact is for this business the fourth consecutive year where these. renewals were subject to soft market conditions. As a result, the rate reductions slowed. down considerably which one may take as indication of a bottoming out of the. reinsurance rates.. Based on our longstanding good relationships with our existing clients we nevertheless. managed to increase our premium volume at terms and conditions which in our judgment. still fulfill our marginal requirements. We achieved this growth without writing single large. transactions from a larger number of new business opportunities and to some extent. from increased shares of existing business.. The growth came mainly from North America, here from the shorter tail classes as well as. some growth on credit and surety. And on the agricultural business we saw a good growth. of our Chinese portfolio.. Our guidance for 2016 remains unchanged as we feel that the business development so. far this year as I already mentioned fully supports that guidance.. Considering the development of our IFRS capital, it is likely that we will again be in the. position at year-end to pay an extraordinary dividend like last year provided that the large. losses remain within budget and there are no contortions on the capital market.. Looking at the individual areas of our P&C reinsurance portfolio, you can see that the. profitability overall is still expected to continue to be above cost of capital. Due to the soft. market, this however is not true for classes like aviation or property and catastrophe. excess of loss, where based on the expected loss levels, the cost of capital will not be. fully earned. On the other hand, we continue to see good profitability on our North. American business as well as on our marine business due to the high quality of those. portfolios.. Furthermore, we have seen some premium growth, for example, in North America. But on. the other hand, a steep decline of volume on classes like aviation where we have to. restructure the book of business to be a soft market book of business.. On structured reinsurance and ILS business, we believe that the volume will be stable to. slightly up for the full year. The results -- this is -- will be the result of some new (service. relief ) transactions or capital management transactions from Eastern Europe as well as. from the US which are effective July 1. And these should more than offset the lost. transactions on service relief motor treaties from China where we saw on premium. incomes last year in excess of EUR200 million.. On our life and health business, we expect to continue to see very attractive profits from. our financial solutions business even without the positive one-off effects that we saw last. year. Our mortality business continued to show good underlying profitability so that. despite the fact that we have to assume that some of the older underwriting years of our. US mortality business will continue to develop adversely, we overall expect to earn the. cost of capital on our mortality business.. From a volume point of view, we continue to see good growth on our longevity business,. particularly from the UK. Whilst this business has become significantly more competitive,. we still are in the position to proactively write transactions which fulfill our profit. requirements.. In line with our strategy, we are confident that we will be able to safeguard a successful. development of our business even in the current difficult trading environment. We. continue to see an underlying increase in profitability of our life and health business. On. the P&C side, we are benefiting from our longstanding relationships with our clients which. allow us to protect the quality of our portfolio. In addition, also due to the very good year. that we enjoyed in 2015 and at the current year even higher reserve buffers than we ever. had in the past.. With our continued positive cash flow we expect that the assets under management will. continue to grow and will allow us to achieve in absolute terms a net investment income. which is in line with the previous years.. As we saw a decrease -- actually a welcome decrease of our admin expenses in the first. half year of 2016, we are confident that we will be able to maintain our competitive. advantage regarding the level of admin expenses.. This concludes the remarks on the first half year of 2016, ladies and gentlemen. And we. would be more than happy to answer your questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) Xinmei Wang, Morgan Stanley.. Xinmei Wang. Hi. Good morning, Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions please. First is. just a bit more clarity on the reserving please. Could you give some detail on the single. claims in Q2 so the one-off recurring, maybe some color as well on the years and. geographies? Then also on the higher frequency basic losses again which years, which. regions. I just wanted to -- which geographies. I just want to understand a bit better where. the reserve charges are coming from.. Then secondly, is how you think about the large loss budget for the next year. I guess you. don't have the same effect as you had in 2015 in terms of the FX impact on the budget.. But in light of the comment on increased frequency would you increase your large loss. budget on the back of that? Then maybe some commentary on the severity side of things. as well. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well yes, thank you for your questions. I mean on the large loss budget it's a little bit early. to say. I doubt if we will increase it significantly. But certainly on the catastrophe loss side. it's basically the result of an actuarial analysis that we look at our cat-exposed business. and calculate simply the expected losses based on the natural catastrophe models.. For the manmade losses, it's more an estimate based on the average of the previous. year. So I mean -- and that can go either way. But I mean the pressure that might increase. a little bit on the manmade losses purely because the business has grown in the last. couple of years and our lines have grown a little bit as well.. If I comment on the frequency of losses that we saw in the Second Quarter and also the -some of the loss reserves development, if you -- if I look at the loss reserve, I mean. versus actually not paid off, it's just individual losses, for example, some Argentinean. business and some business -- some casualty losses from Asia. But we have new. information and so we actually then increased the reserves partly as a matter of caution.. Whether or not we will actually need that, we have to wait and see. But it is in line with our. cautious results -- cautious approach to reserving individual losses. And is not only the. case on newly occurring losses but also on -- as we get new information on existing losses. we take that into account as well naturally.. Otherwise the underlying frequency clearly has been higher this -- in Second Quarter. If. you look at the first half overall it's not so remarkable. First half overall is probably quite in. line with expectation. But Second Quarter was clearly a spike there. And it happens that if. you look at the business on a quarterly basis, that you might have some quarters which. are very benign and others which are seeing -- more activity. On the reserving releases I. will hand that over to Roland.. Roland Vogel. seeing came from various lines of business all around the world there was no. accumulation up to now. We have not at all any indication that this is not just a coincidence. accumulation, that there is any underlying trend or whatever.. On the other hand, when it comes to the redundant reserves we already mentioned that. in 2015 we have increased redundant reserves remarkably. You will hear about the. numbers in October. So the last year we had published was I think EUR1.56 billion for the. end of 2014. That number has increased over the course of 2015 remarkably. We might. have a slight downwards effect this year but we will still be remarkably above the EUR1.56. billion which was the last number we had published. So in this regard, I would echo what. Ulrich mentioned.. It is something which we are expecting. We have mentioned for quite some time that we. do no longer expect to add to redundant reserves in this respect. 2016 was a very. extraordinary year -- 2015 sorry was an extraordinary year and now we are there at -- fully. in line with expectations.. Xinmei Wang. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.. Operator. Anasuya Iyer, Jefferies.. Anasuya Iyer. Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question was just on Life Re. I just wonder given. the mortality losses is there anything you might do differently from here to manage the. losses on these books and what the challenges might be particularly in asking cedants to. recapture some of that business.. My second question also on life re on the longevity EBIT margin, which was around 2.1%.. And I think in several of the previous quarters I've seen it higher than that, maybe close to. 4% or higher than 3% at least. Just wondered if there's a change in the market there that. we should note? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you for those questions. If I look on the -- on our US mortality business the only. area where we have problems is the large ING block that we acquired at the end of 2008.. And here we have two parts of the business. One is so-called modified co-insurance. business where we just -- and I mean get the premiums and reserves off our feeding. companies. Here the XXX reserving and AXXX reserving means that we have to post. rather high letters of credit. We have reduced the letters of credit cost so much this part. of the block is -- it's a -- actually with reduced collateral cost pretty much developing in line. with expectation.. So that leaves then the yearly renewable term business where the reinsurer sets the rate. on its own, somewhat dislocated of the rates of the feeding company. That of course. means that the rates would increase then with age and also the rates are increasing with. the expected payout so that the reserving and therefore the requirements of LCs on this. business is significantly less.. Here, therefore the, say savings on the collateral cost have limited effect and we have to. say that some of these treaties develop adversely. But we have seen the opportunity of. those to increase rates. And in case that -- this is in line with the terms and conditions of. reinsurers we are actually doing that. Of course, there is a time lag because you have to. have the evidence first and we are not doing that lightheartedly. Therefore, only after a. very thorough actual analysis we would approach our clients with rate increases. That's. why I say only where appropriate and necessary.. And -- that of course means that if your claims move -- more adversely than expected so. will the rate increases from a client point of view. But as I said, it has a lag of 18 months to. two years and therefore it is -- and in the mid-term we expect that we would be able to. compensate that problem but it has a short-term negative effect.. Roland Vogel. Longevity.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, on the longevity -- on the longevity business, most of that business, if you look at the. large longevity blocks which is the majority of the business -- other part of the business is. the single premium enhanced annuity business. But if you look at the block business, the. initial margins that we book here is around just the 2% mark. Because I would say all of. these transactions are still rather new. Maybe with the -- or rather green with the. exception of the very old ones which are not many. Because what we are really doing, we. are guaranteeing the pension payouts -- inflation adjusted -- for fixed premium.. And of course in the initial years, as I mentioned on previous calls, you are not expecting. that your pensioners you are paying the pension for will reduce in number to a larger. extent. And therefore , the opportunities that the actual payout and expected payouts will. deviate I would say in the first five years is extremely limited. And that of course increases. in the later years and should earn our margin accordingly. But none of the -- but maybe. bar one -- of those treaties are in the phase where according to our (inaudible) and. margins they earn the full margin as yet.. So we put -- the best part of the margin in reserve at this point in time. That's the reason. why on the longevity unless there is a development on the enhanced annuity you will see. comes from the enhanced annuities.. Anasuya Iyer. Operator. Vinit Malhotra. Operator. Okay, we can hear you now.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay.. Operator. Can you please go ahead with your question?. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you very much. So just a few clarifications please. On the frequency losses where. you have said there is no pattern and you also mentioned that some of these were not. new losses but more new information on existing losses and there you are reserving. conservatively, could you please give us some more clarity or some more numbers to use. here or some idea of how much is new losses how much is just reserve conservatism?. Then secondly on, Ulrich, your comments on you know the usual disclaimer on the. extraordinary dividend is large loss within budget and no distortion on capital markets.. Can we assume that what we have seen in the recent few weeks does not count as. distortion in capital market? Just a very quick clarification.. And I have one or two more questions. If you'd like I can follow up later or if you allow me I. can ask now.. Ulrich Wallin. You may as well go ahead actually.. Vinit Malhotra. seems to have fallen between 1Q and 2Q. Is it just because the budgets have been just. met. Is that the driver of this?. And lastly on the life, it's a little confusing, is the underlying versus last year still expected. to increase as was written on your slide? Or as from your comments just now, it's likely to. be flattish? If you can just please clarify that. Thank you very much, Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. As far as the development on the life goes, Vinit, we expect that the underlying. profitability is still going to increase but only when you exclude, of course, the one-off. effect from last year. You can see that we had about EUR180 million in the first half. If we. have a similar result in the second half that would be in line. Because we are never quite. sure on individual loss claims, you're never quite sure on how the problem business on -of US mortality actually develops on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But the mid-term trend we. are very confident that it's fully intact.. I mean what we have recently seen distortion of the capital market, well, I might say so. but certainly not that it will have a negative effect on this year's results. Because, yes,. there is some new money that we have to invest also in the second half and it will, of. course, be not all that easy to find low-risk, high-yield investment opportunities here. But. that's the smaller part of it.. And at the same time, of course, to the extent that if movement in the portfolio with the. increase valuation reserves, of course, there is a possibility that we will see some further. realized gains. It's, of course, for us our business model not good is that the interest rates. are so low. But that is more a medium-term rather than a 2016 problem.. If you look at the worldwide treaty why the combined ratio has increased in the Second. Quarter. What we report on the property catastrophe excessive loss is what we write and. (inaudible) to be written in our Bermuda subsidiary. The Ecuador loss has been absorbed. in the worldwide treaty reinsurance business. And also, some of the reserves that we put. up say in Asia where we had an increase in the loss reserve and also in Latin America on. some of the business, we just put further prudence in the reserves in the Second Quarter.. That also has been done in the worldwide treaty reinsurance. We do expect that by yearend this number, if the large losses behave -- will improve. again. But if you look, for example at Ecuador, yes, we had some losses but, of course, we. have seen quite significant rate increases on that business as well.. Then on the frequency of losses, it's difficult to give you more color on that, because it. just has been, as Roland said, from a rather wide variety of individual lines of business. We. had, for example, if you look at some of our German business we had a large, very large. treaty which is (inaudible) not too far from home. We had a great result in the First. Quarter. We had a very bad result in the Second Quarter. But the half year is absolutely. fine. So it's these kind of movements that we have seen in the Second Quarter.. And as far as -- the question should we have dipped even a little bit deeper in our loss. reserve? Well of course, we could have but on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are. relatively protective of our position there. And therefore, we did improve the combined. ratio to some extent but maybe not quite to the level of expectation.. Roland Vogel. Maybe, Vinit, if I can add here. So if we look at the number I did mention the extraordinary. one-off positive of EUR150 million with the large loss but it fully exhausted. This gives you. a little bit of an indication of the overall amount of developments below expectations.. And your question how is this distributed when it comes to negative run-off or higher. frequency. If you -- so we are looking at an overall number of EUR100 million plus. But you. could divide that by two. But to put that into perspective we are looking at a reserve. portfolio of more than EUR22 billion so in this regard we are not overly excited.. Ulrich Wallin. I can also add that, of course, under IFRS we book our IBNR what we call segment reverse.. And they are actually up, after the first half year this year if you compared with the first. half year last year. So the IBNR reserves compared to the same period last year has. actually increased rather than decreased.. I'm not fully alarmed even though I think it also has to be said that with the continued soft. market the business does not, at least our business, does not have the margins to absorb. a lot of negative development without resorting to the -- what we've done with the loss. reserves. I think we have to accept that. We don't have to (press) it but it's a fact.. Vinit Malhotra. that, they are worried that -- whether this is the pattern from previous low prices or low. terms and conditions. But you have said there is no pattern. And equally just probably just. actual loss. Is that correct understanding?. Roland Vogel. I don't have the number with me. But if I look at what we know today I think this should. give you a guidance. And again, it's distributed around the world in lines of business so. this is a little bit the indication that we do not see a real pattern here.. Ulrich Wallin. And it is largely reserves that you can see from the cash flow. It hasn't impacted the cash. flow you might say as yet. But it definitely has -- it is pretty much in the reserves rather. than in extra paid losses.. Vinit Malhotra. All right. Thank you for clarification. Thank you, sir.. Operator. Jonny Urwin, UBS.. Jonny Urwin. Morning all. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me please. So firstly just. thinking about how the retro program is working. You've obviously made some recoveries. in the quarter. I just wondered given peak hurricane season is ahead of us starting midAugust time. How well covered are you? Have you burned through a lot of retentions on. some lines? I know that the (k-session) kicks in from the first dollar loss. But on reinsurance. programs elsewhere, how much is still to go before you make material recoveries after a. Q2 spike in losses.. Secondly on pricing, there are lots of comments around bottoming out here as we've. seen from peers earlier in the Q2 reporting period. I'd be interested to get a bit more. color on where you think we are in the pricing cycle. Do you think we are about to turn? It. seems to me that we need a real loss to turn the market and if we don't get that we'll just. sort of bump along on the bottom. So I'd be interested to get your comments there.. Thank you very much.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you. If I look at our retro program, the recoveries are largely from the ksession. The vertical programs that we buy is un-impacted. Of course, the vertical. program puts a ceiling on the Canadian situation so that will -- this is contained I would say. from that.. But pretty much, most of it if you look at k it's not a negative territory as a result of the. losses. So we have eaten in and part of the premium but overall I think the k-session is still. pretty fine. Of course, it has less room now if it wants to be profitable for some major. hurricane losses or something like that. So no concern here.. If you look at the pricing, I would say overall the -- well, we haven't seen a change in the. sentiment I would say. Of course, there is increasing concerns with the reinsurer told to. reduce their prices further because we all have predictive modeling and of course, the. rating models and rating tools, even if you tweak them, would probably say that the prices. are rather slim that we are currently charge. And therefore, these rate reductions are. slowing. I would expect that that will continue to happen if the trend of reported results. from the reinsurance business and the reinsurance continues as is currently being seen.. But I don't see a change, a fundamental change in the cycle at this point in time I must say.. And of course, again I couldn't mention it often enough. The business that came for. renewal in the Second Quarter this year had, in some cases, seen rate reductions already. in three times consecutively in previous renewals. So it's not great.. Additional, if you look at the primary business that also sees some pressure on rates. particularly on the specialty lines, a little bit more than say one or two years ago. And of. time rather than excessive loss and facultative, those rating pressures on the primary. business will eventually also filter through to the reinsurance business even though -- even. if we don't change say terms and conditions from the reinsurance.. So I would say we have a reinsurance market that's reasonably concerned with the low. pricing but there is no fundamental turn at this point in time. That's an observation. And. from -- that's why I say we are safeguarding to the extent we can our loss reserve buffers,. because it is quite comfortable in the current market to have that.. Jonny Urwin. Thank you very much.. Operator. Kamran Hossain, RBC.. Kamran Hossain. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Can you hear me?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. I've one clarification and two questions. The first one is just to cover some of. Roland's points as a clarification. I'm not sure whether I heard it correctly or whether I. missed something. But did you said that in terms of how we should think about the. reserve for redundancy we should expect 2015 to go up and 2016 in absolute levels come. down. So that's the clarification.. The second question, again so I'm going to probably stick on this reserve redundancy. point, what was the thought process behind using the redundancy at this point in the. year? So you take EUR150 million out of the redundancy versus doing it later in the year.. We still have -- you said you have EUR472 million of budget left for the year. We don't. know what happens for the remainder of the year. So not just the opportunity to true this. up at the year end.. And I guess the second part of that question is if we have a light hurricane season will you. look to build that redundant cat reserve back into the overall redundancy?. Then the third part I wanted to talk about is, given your -- you've been willing to use. reserve surplus to produce earnings or you will be looking to that going forward. What's. your overall confidence on forward earnings from here as a result of using quite a large. chunk of overall redundancy? Sorry to stick on the one subject but it's kind of my highlight. for this morning. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. No. That's fine. First of all, I would say the development of the reserve redundancies in. 2015 was quite unexpected from us. And the reason for that was not that -- the rating. quality of the business in 2015 was great. The reason was that we saw on our books. losses develop significantly below expectation. And that is the reason why we saw this. development.. I would say from that point of view we also reached a point where on the -- even with our. auditors under IFRS we would be hard pressed and probably be not possible for us to. further increase the redundancies here anyhow. And therefore, we were willing to use a. little bit of that.. Also, where we used this has rather been from older underwriting years on shorter tail. lines where it would have been difficult to defend some at year end anyhow. A good. example for that is our marine business where we have seen a remarkable 12% combined. ratio in the first half. This is all underwriting here. So 2011 and prior where we had reserves. just sitting there.. But the tail, marine is mid tail and therefore clearly because it was also pretty much taken. from excess of loss rather than proportionate. Clearly, at one point in time these loss. reserves have to be released anyhow because the losses are simply not there. And yes,. we could have done that at year end but considering the spike in losses that we have. seen in the Second Quarter in line with what we said for some while now we used that for. -- really even out that a little bit in the Second Quarter.. If you look at the overall redundancy level in 2016, it's a little bit too early to comment.. And because that -- its dependant also on the losses as we develop on the current year.. And that will be taken into account in the loss reserves study at year end.. But one thing I should mention that on the new underwriting years 2016 and underwriting. year 2015 we kept the loss ratio PEGs entirely unchanged. And they would still -- there we. still book combined ratios excess of 100. So there if expectations in the end come to. fruition we would probably have to set some further prudence in our reserves on the new. underwriting years.. Kamran Hossain. And in terms of what this means for looking forwards and confidence on earnings are we. still in the position -- I got the feeling at year-end and in Q1, you were still fairly confident. not just about 2016 but about the medium-term based on the balance sheet buffers. Is. that still the position internally?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. On the P&C underwriting result we feel that that is for the coming years pretty well. safeguarded, as long as the losses are not over the large loss budget.. Of course, from a strategic point of view, we believe that eventually the market will turn. and we will see better rates again, which allow lower underlying combined ratios. Of. course, we think that this will happen at a time, at least that's the plan, when we still have. some reserve buffers left.. Kamran Hossain. Perfect. That's really --. Ulrich Wallin. But I think you should also be very clear, the current pricing level that we see in the. reinsurance market, does not necessarily support combined ratios at the expected loss. levels in the low 90s. We just don't see that.. Kamran Hossain. Perfect. Thanks very much for the answer. I think you've put a lot of my concerns to rest.. Thank you.. Operator. Michael Huttner, JPMorgan Cazenove.. Michael Huttner. Thank you. So much. I probably missed it. And apologies, I'm sure I did. What is the. underlying combined ratios. So if you stripped out these reserve movements on the nat. cat in Q1, in Q2 and the first half ?. Then are you also tempted, like your peers, to move to quarterly accounting, which I. guess would iron out some this (move).. Then on the solvency, I wonder if you can -- you said it would be likely up. I wonder if you. can give a feel for how much up?. Then on the reserving, just to go back a little bit. And I'm sure you gave the number. But I. missed it. What is the amount of reserve additions within the total reserve movement?. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well if I start with the Solvency II ratio, as you know, we had to report it based on year-end. numbers that 120% -- sorry, 221%. This is due to the increase in capital up to 227 now. So. this refers to the increased bid.. If you look at the underlying combined ratio, in our books that would be based on. expected cat losses and based on the loss ratio PEGs that we have on the newer. underwriting years, would be, I would say, around 98%, 99%. However, if you then take. into account to the high initial loss ratio PEG (C) normally expected run of profit, we are. still, I would say, in the region I would say of around 96%.. Michael Huttner. This is half-year, right?. Roland Vogel. Yes.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes.. Michael Huttner. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Does that answer all the questions then or is it more?. Michael Huttner. Was there a number -- yes, it was just a number, because you were talking about adding. to reserves for Argentina and casualty in Asia. Do you have -- is there a figure? Is the. EUR150 million net of these? And how much are these?. Ulrich Wallin. I don't think we have a concrete figure there.. Roland Vogel. (No), I think we tried to explain that quite some time. And Ulrich mentioned the loss ratio. fixed for the current year. So what I'd mention is that again in 2015 the redundant reserves. went up remarkably. We now see an extraordinary run-off which I have quantified with. EUR150 million.. So now it depends as to whether we have built up new redundancies for the current years. in the amount of EUR150 million, then the confidence level would remain exactly where it. was. Or as to whether we have built up a lower or a higher number. We will only know that. for sure after the next reserve analysis, which is by year-end. I did mention that our. assumption right now is that the redundancy level as compared to the end of 2015 has. decreased slightly.. Ulrich Wallin. And of course, on quarterly accounting, yes, we will be required to set up the Pillar 3. reporting, including the economic balance sheet on a quarterly basis. And we will of. course do that.. Michael Huttner. Okay, brilliant. Thank you.. Operator. William Hawkins, KBW.. William Hawkins. Hello, thank you very much. Just one question, sort of following up to the earlier)one. I'm. trying to just be clear about what your message is for the US mortality business. We know. it's already been a problem area. Your margin's been bouncing around a bit. It was low in. the Second Quarter. But it wasn't really disastrously low. And if you hadn't actually. mentioned US mortality, I at least wouldn't really have focused on it as much of a point.. So are you trying to tell us that US mortality has started to deviate again from your. expectations. And it may require further remedial action? Or can you just be clear about. whether there really is a problem here and whether -- what's going on. Because to me,. the headline numbers, unless there's something offsetting US mortality within your 4.3%,. doesn't actually seem to be too bad a result.. Ulrich Wallin. Well the US mortality on the new business that we write since 2009, which we call organic. business is actually performing head of expectation. This is a growing part of the book. and the same is true for some of the smaller blocks that we acquired. So that's why the. overall number is not looking all that bad.. The large block that we bought, there again, it's the YRT business where we continue to. see some loss emergence which is above our revised view on the most likely outcome.. That's the reason why we will impose further rate increases in order to combat that. problem.. In the actual numbers, it's not always easy to define, because of course it's in one line. with all the rest of the mortality business and there the development is actually positive.. But when I look for the difference in the EBIT on the first and Second Quarter, that is. exactly from this YRT business I just mentioned.. William Hawkins. Might it be fair to say then that there could be further remedial action that could hurt the. (multiple speakers).. Ulrich Wallin. There will be. There will be further rate increases. There's no question about that.. William Hawkins. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. In-Yong Hwang, Goldman Sachs.. In-Yong Hwang. Hello, thank you for taking my questions. Just two very quick ones, hopefully. Firstly, just. could you update us on what your reinvestment yield is?. Secondly on the July renewals, most of the growth seems to have come from the new. business, I think, from your existing clients in the US. Just a quick word on what's driving. growth there. And is it just increased demand on some of your specifics or are there. common themes behind this? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. If I take the first one -- the second one first and then Roland take the other one.. Yes. Where we grow in the US, as I said, it's more the short-tail lines, it's increased. demand from existing clients, which we are able to write some business which we feel is. very attractive. That's where the growth in the US comes from. It's not a large US excess. casualty quota shares, because we still are shying away from them, mainly because of the. experience that we had in the last soft market.. So we are not, despite the overall soft market, we are not unhappy with that growth. We. think it's proper growth.. Roland Vogel. With regard to the reinvestment yield, you know that we usually do comment on two. numbers, one of which is very easy to calculate, which is why I have it very concrete. This is. exactly what is the reinvestments yield on the portfolio, which I have today, if I would. reinvest an additional euro or dollar exactly in the portfolio composition as it is today. That. amount is on at least for the time of my responsibility on an all-time low of 1.37%. You also. know that we do not exactly reinvest into the composition where we are today. So the real. investment yield, or reinvestment yield should be a little bit higher than that, I would. assume, it's a little bit above 1.5%.. Let me give you some additional remarks to that. So right now, I would have to expect. that the dilution of the ROI is a little bit higher than it was before. So I usually say it's 10 to. 15 basis points but maybe it is right now 15 to 20 basis points.. On the other hand, you should also still bear in mind that with the barbell strategy we. have been entertaining for a good year now, we see that a portion of our government. bonds has gone up, which of course also means that with the rate decreases we have. been seeing, this is where valuation reserves come from. So the value of these. investments, the relative value of these investments, have increased.. Moreover, it was also interesting to see the sterling going down. Also with the sterling -the euro going down slightly as well, at least after the Brexit and in this regard we saw. some positive developments from the US dollar and the Aussie)dollar and whatever.. So overall the message is -- yes, the reinvestment yield has gone down slightly again. Also. again the valuation reserves have gone up drastically. We have not harvested any of that. and the buffer has increased to EUR2.5 million in variation reserves right now.. In-Yong Hwang. Great, thank you.. Operator. Frank Kopfinger, Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. Thank you, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on the investment. income, there specifically on the realized gains also on a net level, if you take realized. gains and realized losses into account then yes, they are on a similar level. However, if you. only look into the realized gains, I think they are quite high in Q2. You mentioned that this. is coming from private equity. However, could you comment again on where this high level. of realized gains if you only focused on these come from? What the drivers were to have. these specifically in Q2?. Then my second question is on your portfolio, also on the renewals. Do you see some. pressure on your combined ratio from a shift mix within your portfolios (say) higher. proportional share. But also a shift mix in other lines?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I'll take the second one first. I would say to some extent the portfolio shifts a little bit. towards some higher combined ratios because a proportion of pro rata business is. increasing and the proportion of excess of loss is slightly going down, even though it's. relatively large.. In addition, of course, on the excess of loss, it depends on the way the losses are actually. -- develop and happen. But if you just purely take the expected loss values that are. calculated from the rating tools, then of course also on the excess of loss business, take. lower pricing, the combined ratios would increase at a level of expected losses. It would. still be even at a level of expected losses, the combined ratio would still be lower on. excess of loss than on pro rata, because of the higher volatility of the results there.. There is a tendency in our book. And I would say overall in the market, with the shift to the. pro rata book that there will also be a shift that the underlying combined ratios will. probably increase.. Roland Vogel",20160804_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2016-8-4_SD000000002853744569.pdf,2016-08-04
4,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call. presenting the results for the first nine months of 2017. As always, I'm joined by our CFO,. Roland Vogel.. After years of moderate losses, we saw an accumulation of severe natural catastrophes in. the Third Quarter, particularly in the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean. Protecting against the. consequences of such events is the central goal of reinsurance. For us as a reinsurer, our. top priority is the efficiently settling of the incurred claims and the support of our clients.. This way, reinsurance can also play a part in alleviating the humanitarian and economic. impacts of natural disasters such as the ones of the Third Quarter of this year.. The national catastrophe losses in the Third Quarter resulted in a large loss burden for. Hannover Re of EUR 766 million. Within this number, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria,. together with the 2 Mexican quakes, amount to EUR 222 million of net losses. The largest. of these losses is Hurricane Irma with EUR 330 million, followed by Hurricane Maria, it's. EUR 221 million; and Hurricane Harvey was EUR 100 million, all numbers are net of. retrocession and before taxes.. Based on the currently industry loss figures reported by various sources as well as the. figures published by the reinsurance industry, it would -- this would give us a market share. in the losses falling on the reinsurance market of around 1.5% to 2.5%. Whilst these figures. are subject to significant uncertainties and recognizing that the reported losses from the. industry fall short of the industry losses estimated by the various cat modeling firms, this. nevertheless would suggest that Hannover Re's market share in the losses is well below. its market share in the reinsurance business overall, which is around 5%. This confirms our. strategy we followed in recent years to have lower market share in the natural. catastrophe exposed business as compared to the overall reinsurance business.. Despite the losses in the Third Quarter, we managed not to fall to a bottom line loss in. that quarter. But maintained a small net profit of EUR 40 million. This, comparatively,. positive result was achieved on the back of a very positive investment income, which,. beside an increase in the ordinary investment income of more than 10%, was aided by the. sale of our quoted expertise, which boosted the realized gains by EUR 226 million. So. sales was not only motivated to absorb part of the negative effects of the natural. catastrophe losses. But also to free up capital, which can be utilized in taking increased. underwriting risks based on the expected improvements and the conditions of the. property casualty reinsurance market.. On the Life & Health business, we saw a drop of the EBIT in the net income, which was. largely due to a one-off impact from our in-force management of our legacy U.S. mortality. business as a result of the recapture of some loss-making treaties. This one-off effect. amounted to EUR 45 million. Otherwise, the very positive development of our financial. solutions business as well as our business outside North America could not fully. compensate for the continuously higher-than-expected claims from our U.S. legacy. mortality business.. On this note, I would like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain the figures in. more details.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Uli. After various quarters, which were rather in line also,. we have to report some extraordinary items for the Third Quarter 2017. Still, I will try to. keep my comments as brief as possible and usual because I'm sure you have a wide. variety of questions.. The top line development for the first nine months of 2017 continues to be favorable and. the bulk of our expectations from the beginning of the year. But very much in line with the. first half year numbers. You will see later that this is entirely driven by our P&C business. group whereas our Life & Health business showed a small declining gross premium.. Net premiums increased by 8.4% adjusted for currency effects with a difference. compared to the gross premium development driven by additions to unearned premiums. as the retention remaining fairly stable. Apart from the stable, net retention on the group. level here, it might be worth mentioning that the stand-alone quarter, as Uli already on. mentioned, ended with a small profit and the tax rate is down by quite some margin.. Here, although the profit contribution from lower tax jurisdictions went down, this was. overcompensated by the fact that the realized gains from the equity portfolio are only. taxed at very reduced rates.. Moreover, in Essen, Germany showed a very strong result, which has increased the. minority deductions as compared to the previous year.. On the next slide, the operating cash flow continues to be very positive, also slightly. below last year's average. One should have in mind that the strong increase in our. structured reinsurance business is not very cash flow accretive in contrast, for example, to. nonproportional contracts. Nevertheless, assets under own management decreased to. roughly EUR 40 billion, significantly driven by negative FX or currency effects of around. EUR 2.5 billion due to the strengthening of the euro against most of the relevant. currencies.. On top of this development, we paid out last year's dividend, which, overall, was only. partially compensated by the positive operating cash flow of a good EUR 1.5 billion.. In order to understand the development of the IFRS capital position, one should start. reading the next slide on the right-hand side. Shareholders' equity decreased by 8.9%,. driven mainly by factors that we have already mentioned. There was a payment of a. record dividend, including the special dividend that amounted to EUR 603 million.. Additionally, the exchange rate movements as part of the OCI had a negative impact of. EUR 650 million. This especially reflects the currency translation of the capital position of. our subsidiaries. Moreover, the sale of the equities resulted in the realization of some. valuation reserve, which was only partly mitigated by an increase of other asset classes.. Taking all these developments into account, I would circle our capital position is strong.. And you probably are aware that the rating agencies take the same view. S&P just. renewed our rating of AA; and a stable outlook here during Q3. Furthermore, in October,. A.M. Best placed our rating under review with positive implications following the release of. the updated rating methodology.. On the next slide, the P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 16.1% on an FX. adjusted basis. This is mainly based on the successful new business written by our. structured reinsurance team. Additionally, as a result of our strong position in the industry,. we could grow some selective markets like for instance, U.S. property, China and Australia.. But also the first time consolidation of our Argenta acquisition has contributed for the first. time. Although here in the P&C, the difference between the gross and the net. development was caused by movements of the unearned premium reserve.. At 30.8% of net premium, major losses were about 4 combined ratio points above the. budget for the first 3 quarters, mainly owing to Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 2. earthquakes in Mexico. The combined ratio of 104.4% is, therefore, of course, clearly. above the full year target compared to last year with more than 1% of the increase. And. combined ratio stems from the Advanced Solutions segment, which we, on the one hand,. write with higher than 96% combined ratios plus some of the contracts were affected by. hurricanes as well. Major parts of these losses will be compensated in the future based on. the conditions of such longer-term agreements. But you should also bear in mind that the. opt in reserving remained unchanged since the end of the Second Quarter. Please. remember here, we had EUR 291 million additional reserves compensated by IBNR. releases. We will reflect the potential positive changes envisaged from another change in. the legal framework whenever we have more certainty about it.. Apart from such considerations, runoff profits have not been extraordinary. And we. expect the level of redundancies to be at the Q2 level. The ordinary investment income. was slightly ahead of expectations, mainly driven by a strong contribution from private. equity and real estate. And on top of that, of course, the disposal of the listed equities. boosted the good investment result even further in this segment.. We achieved EBIT margin of 8.9% as a little bit below our target. But given the frequency. of the natural catastrophe losses, the number is a good one especially as compared with. the industry.. Major losses may reach historic highs here in the next slide like the ones we saw in 2005. and 2011. Although 2011 and 2017 on this slide seem to have a very similar gross and net. impact for us, one needs to bear in mind that 2017 also reflects more than EUR 350. million losses from our ILS segment and the collateralized reinsurance, which go in and. out. And if we adjust for that, that means that, on the one hand, our retro cover were a. little bit less effective as compared to 2011 as we had more losses from proportional. treaties, which were not protected by the K-Cession. And on the Irma reached into the. nonproportional whole account protection, on the other hand, it also means that the vast. majority of our retro cover is still available and we could also already offer new coverage. for clients who needed it for the rest of the year. One thing should -- we should really not. forget is the remarkable level of uncertainty about all such rather new estimates.. The large loss here is an interesting one this quarter. As I said, the numbers look very. precise. But they are all early estimates. Maria, for instance, occurred just about 3 weeks. before we had to close our books for the Third Quarter. And that demonstrates the. uncertainty. If you count the 3 major hurricanes together, we are estimating our loss. currently at EUR 650 million. If you add the 2 earthquakes to the numbers, this would be in. the region of EUR 720 million. Including the ILS contracts, we overall had a 50% or 45%. relief from our retrocessions.. The next slide looks completely different if you -- we compare that with the Q2. conference call as the natural catastrophe losses have impacted various markets. Overall,. the total combined ratio came in clearly above the MtCR. Just as a reminder, the. combined ratio for the U.K., London market in direct business line stands out and that is,. to some extent or to a large extent, the result of the reserves strengthening for the. change in the Ogden tables over the course of the first half year.. In Life & Health, gross written premium increased slightly by 0.7% on an FX adjusted basis.. That is in the ballpark of our expectations for the full year as well. We have seen growth in. a number of regions as it's China, Australia and the U.S. This was, however, offset by. reduced premium income due to the discontinuation of larger volume contracts in our U.K.. annuity segment.. As reported in previous quarters, the result of our legacy U.S. mortality business had not. lived up to our expectations. This was the case for the reported results on an ongoing. basis. But also in addition, as Uli mentioned already, the preannounced recapture of our. mortality treaty materialized as expected and led to an average result of minus EUR 45. million. From an economic point of view, the recapture was still very beneficial as it will. improve the future results by quite some margin.. In contrast to the mortality, the profitability of our financial solutions business continued to. be excellent. These developments are also reflected in their respective EBIT margins.. Income from funds withheld declined by EUR 64 million due to the discontinuation of 2. large financing treaties. As indicated on previous occasions, the profit from the deposit. accounted business, mainly the U.S. financial solution, has grown remarkably. It reached a. level of EUR 139 million, which is reflected in the other income and expenses lines.. Currency effects, on the other hand, had a slightly negative impact.. Looking at the investments, the development in the first 3 quarters 2017 was very. pleasing. The ordinary return of 3.1% is well above the expectation for the full year. And in. light of the strong contribution from private equity and real estate, the ordinary result. increased by an impressive 11.5%. The income from private equity did, however, include. some extraordinary elements, which we cannot expect to reoccur in the Fourth Quarter.. Uli had already indicated the background of our decision to sell our portfolio of listed. equities short after Maria had hit Puerto Rico and a major loss for the industry was. foreseeable. We had realized a bit more than EUR 220 million in gains. According to IFRS,. such profits are really ROE accretive as they increase the profits and they decrease the. IFRS capital as the variation reserves go down. On the Solvency II, the decrease in capital. is not reflected in the owned funds. But the decrease of the high capital requirements for. the equity is reflected so that solvency ratio should be impacted positively. And according. to German GAAP, the dividend-paying German holding company, had a re as he receives. any tax-free profits. In light of such advantages, it was -- the decision was easy to make.. Moreover, of course, we took into consideration the strong performance and the. valuation of the private -- of the listed equities especially in this year. We will further use. equities as a technical instrument and may enter again if opportunities arise.. Before that background, the overall return of the investments was very strong at 3.9%. while valuation reserves were slightly reduced. But the remaining portfolio remains strong. and on a high level.. You're on the next slide that is very familiar to you. It shows the overview of how the. different asset classes contributed to the ordinary investment income as compared to. where we are invested. Nothing extraordinary here.. And I think that should conclude my remarks. And as usual, I'll leave the target matrix and. the outlook to Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Talking about the target matrix, you can see that we have 3 ticks, or I. might say only 3 ticks. I think the return on investment, as Roland explained, the growth of. the P&C premium as well as the EBIT margin on our very successful financial solution and. longevity business. The remainder of the target, particular regarding the profits, were. impacted naturally by the high (losses) of natural catastrophes in the Third Quarter. In. order to avoid any confusion, let me emphasize that this target matrix is still the one from. the strategy cycle 2015 to 2017. And therefore, it's slightly different from the new one,. which we presented on our Investor Day in October.. Coming to the outlook and here in particular to our new guidance for 2017. You will recall. that we gave a profit warning in 21st of September 2017, following the significant losses in. the Third Quarter. Because of these losses, it became evident that one of the providers. of our profit guidance was no longer fulfilled being that the large losses remained this in. the large loss budget.. Regarding the premium volume, we left our guidance unchanged because the guidance. for growth of more than 5% is well supported by the 9-month figures.. Return on investment, we increased to more than 3% from more than 2.7% and that, of. course, reflects the very positive development of the investment income in the first nine. months, not least due to the sale of the listed equity portfolio.. Group net income, we now estimate at around EUR 800 million. And that, of course,. reflects that we are missing the profits from the Third Quarter, which largely was, as you. call in Germany, the black zero. And therefore, we have to do the three quarter profits for. this year. This, of course, is still subject to the proviso that the large losses for the Fourth. Quarter remain this in the budget for the Fourth Quarter being EUR 202 million and that. we see no dislocation in the capital market. I should also caution, I guess, at this point in. time that the loss estimates for the Third Quarter losses are still subject to significant. uncertainties, which would -- which may go either way. I mean, we will see a little bit. clearer at the end of the year. But also then, uncertainties will remain significant.. The dividend payout should not be affected by the reduced profits. But we expect,. provided that the Fourth Quarter is in line with expectation, that we will still be in the. position to pay out the same dividend as last year being the ordinary as well as the. special dividend.. Coming to the profitability of the P&C business for 2017 as well as the development of. the volumes, you can see that due to the cat losses above the large loss budget, we are. not expecting to earn the cost of capital on our property casualty reinsurance for this year.. The affected areas, of course, North America as well as the natural catastrophe excess of. loss business. However, also the U.K. and the London market is affected. This, of course,. by the Ogden tables.. On the other hand, our very diversified book mitigates the impact of those cat losses.. And you can see that in the lines of Continental Europe where we have very good. profitability as well as Marine, credit and surety and in particular, the facultative book. So. you can see that a very diversified book of business with below-market average share in. catastrophe-exposed business allow us even at heavy catastrophe losses to still show. somewhat acceptable results.. Coming to the Life & Health business. You can see that our financial solution business, we. expect to continue to be very, very profitable with longevity and morbidity business. We. expect to earn the cost of capital. As far as the mortality business is concerned is the. negative effect, including the one-off effect from our U.S. legacy business will push the. entire segment or subsegment into profitability levels, which are not sufficient to fulfill as a. cost of capital.. On the premium side, we expect a rather stable premium development for the entire. year. There might actually be a slight increase because we already have seen some. increases in the Third Quarter. And we expect that to continue into the Fourth Quarter.. However, it will be largely stable.. Coming now to the guidance of 2018. And I should emphasize that this guidance does not. include the effects of the hardening market, which is expected following the Third Quarter. losses and the reported results of the reinsurance industry for the first nine months of the. year. Therefore, the premium growth, we expect single-digit growth. We haven't specified. low or high single digits that will really remain to be seen based on the actual effects of. the hardening market.. Return on investment, we expect at 2.7%, which is stable ordinary investment income. compared to the average of the last five years. I would say, in absolute terms but also in. relative terms, we see a stabilization here. I think Roland explained that in detail at the. Investor Day in October.. Net income, we estimate back more than EUR 1 billion. Again, that also does not include a. hardening market. At the same time, of course, it's also subject to the possibility of. further recaptures within our legacy U.S. mortality business that might take a negative IFRS. impact. But will have a positive long-term impact on the profitability. In addition, I should. caution that there might also be an unforeseen further acceleration in the actual losses. from that business, which, of course, could have a negative impact as well. Overall,. however, we feel well positioned to achieve again a profitability above EUR 1 billion in. 2018.. Our dividend policy remains unchanged as the basic dividend will be 35% to 40% of the. IFRS profitability. And depending on business opportunities and capital development,. there's a good possibility that we also will again pay a special dividend.. This now brings me to the last slide, I guess, which is the prospects, the midterm. prospects. Here on the property/casualty side, we feel that things are a little bit more. positive than they have been in previous years because we already see for us find of a. more or less than across-the-board trimming of the reinsurance market on the P&C side.. Of course, more pronounced on the loss affected business. But also we expect firming of. some market on loss business and have already witnessed first evidence of that.. Therefore, we feel that our combined ratio target of 96% or below is achievable in 2018. and beyond without resorting to reduce -- to reduction in the confidence level of our loss. reserves.. With our strong market position, we also feel that we could benefit from the growth of. the market more than the average market player and thus are expecting to slightly. increase our market share. And as a result of that, we expect a positive impact both on. the bottom and the top line of our P&C business.. In Life & Health, we expect a continuous attractive earnings from our U.S. financial. solutions business and the majority of our non-U. S. business.. For the overall profitability, the main importance would be the success of our in-force. management of our legacy U.S. mortality business, where we are confident that we could. achieve the necessary adjustments on the rate, in particular on the YRT business.. That said, for 2018, there is some uncertainty on the EBIT contribution due to the. possibility of recaptures, which may result in a negative impact on the IFRS earnings in. 2018. But of course, it would be positive for the future earnings of our Life & Health group.. With that, we expect an EBIT between EUR 200 million and EUR 300 million in 2018. And. that, of course, would largely depend on to the extent of the recaptures that we are. seeing.. A favorable development of new business and the already mentioned in-force. management give us a positive outlook for the IFRS profitability for 2019 and onwards.. On our investment, I think Roland explained in detail the stabilization of the ROI as a. percentage of the ordinary investment income from 2018 onwards. Then, of course, this. expected increased volumes in the medium term would suggest that we would be able. to increase our returns in absolute figures.. That concludes our presentations. And I look forward together with Roland to your. questions. Thank you very much for listening.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Kamran Hossain of RBC.. Kamran Hossain. Two questions. The first one is just trying to understand that the context of having the. (XT) portfolio and then what that means for growth. So I look at your 2018 guidance and. you said kind of single-digit growth for the group. But at the same time, you've kind of. freed up this cash, which in my mind should allow you to grow more, especially in P&C in. the coming year. What should we think about there? I mean, is that single-digit growth. really, really conservative? Just kind of any thoughts on that will be really helpful. And. second, in the life EBIT guidance for 2018, what level of recapture is included in that. assumption? And what kind of level of confidence do you have that this will be sufficient?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thanks for those questions, Kamran. Firstly, on the guidance, the growth guidance for. 2018, this was done really before because it's a plan, which was concluded before we. actually saw the effects of the Third Quarter losses and the effects on the market and it. was also before we were selling our listed equities. Therefore, I think on the P&C side,. this is a rather conservative estimate. I mean, we think there may be opportunities for. good growth on the P&C side in 2018. On the EBIT for the Life & Health, I mean, the EUR. 300 million upper end of the range would include of recap -- negative impact from. recapture, I would say, of up to EUR 100 million and of course, I mean, the lower end and. then slightly more.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. I just wanted to follow up on the retrocession comment that Roland was making,. suggesting that retro cover was less effective. I mean, relative to the budget, obviously,. 2017 has been far better managed in terms of net lease. Could you just clarify what that. comment meant, Roland? And just in that same context, I've noticed that on your line-byline combined ratios, the structured reinsurance and ILS was much worse in 3Q than 1H. Is. it just the same effect? So just as a clarification needed. And secondly, just on the. motivation for the equity sale. If -- you said this several times, I apologize. But just a. clarification, it was done primarily to have more capital to participate in the market. hardening. Will that be a correct understanding? Or was it done also for tactical reason?. But which one was the more important way, is what I'm trying to understand.. Well it was both, I mean, because -- I mean, of course, it was the rather neat way of. mitigating the impact because, I mean, the development of the equity markets have been. very favorable. So we had much of significantly large portions of unrealized gains on them,. which, of course, are clearly subject to change. And therefore, we thought -- I mean, not. only for the capital base. But also from a result point of view, it would be an opportune. time to utilize those gains. I mean, our expertise strategy remains unchanged. I mean, we. have certain triggers for investment and we have certain triggers for divestment. We were. pretty close to our divestment trigger. But not quite there. But so we just accelerated that. because it became quite handy. I mean, this is basically the motivation. And of course, the. positive effects on the capital adequacy ratio gives us the room to pay and see on the. one hand, of course, to write more business in 2018. But also, I mean, to pay an extra. dividend for the current year, which we deem to be in the interest of shareholders at least. in the interest of our majority shareholder. And therefore, overall, it seemed to be a. plausible thing to do. I mean, on the effectiveness of our retro program, it has to be said. that the growth loss includes a significant amount, as Roland already mentioned, that we. are directly ceding to the capital markets. So this is business, which we accepted and then. just, I mean, make it suitable for the capital markets. So it's really a pass-through. And that. is the majority of the difference between gross and net. Our overall retrocession program. was not that heavily impacted outside an aggregate excess of loss that we bought, which,. of course, was a total to the tune of a little bit more than EUR 100 million recovery. But. look at the whole account, I mean that has attachment point of EUR 350 million for peak. zones and EUR 250 million for nonpeak zones. That was only partly hit by Irma, not hit by. the other losses. And also K, a lot of the losses that are not subject K. So the K result is. still relatively benign for our investors there. Therefore, I mean, the collection was less. pronounced as in 2017. It would have been for us, in theory a lot better for all the losses. would have been -- I mean, accumulated into one loss because -- and then outside the. aggregate is several loss, of course. Our program could be -- would have been suited. better. Needless to say, I mean, the overall net amount of losses that we have from those. events are well within the expected parameters for return periods, say, around seven. years.. Operator. The next question is from Guilhem Horvath of Exane BNP Paribas.. Guilhem Horvath. Two questions from my side. The first one is I would like to have your view on this exercise. that's everyone is trying to contribute today in sending out all the reported losses and. trying to reach the USD 95 billion or USD 100 billion total loss for the industry. What is your. view on the fact that part of this is missing? And maybe in line with this, you said that your. -- particularly your Maria estimate was computed very shortly before you closed your. quarter. This estimate materially moved since you closed the quarter? And if yes, in which. direction? And the second question would be on the negotiations. Can you update us a. little bit on what you see in the market today regarding your own business negotiations.. But also the retro, you mentioned that the retro was only slightly affected by the recent. events? And you also said at Investor Day that you expected the retro prices for you not. to increase too much or at least you not accepting higher prices on retro. Is this still the. Ulrich Wallin. Well on -- I mean, yes, you're absolutely right that the loss estimates are of, I mean, early. estimates and that they have not reached the modeled numbers of, say, I would say,. people say it's anywhere between EUR 75 billion to EUR 225 billion. I must say, I mean. So. far, our estimate tracked pretty well with the advised losses that we have seen so far,. which, of course, are only a fraction of the losses that we have booked. On Maria in. particular, I mean, I would say there are some positives and some negatives. Overall, I. would say that at this point in time, the loss estimate that we have given on or that we. have booked on Maria still looks pretty solid. Overall, I think we will have to watch the. development of these losses in the next couple of years because if you look at the U.S.. domestic losses, which are the least of concern to us due to our low market shares in the. affected areas, I mean, there is such a vast number of individual small and large losses. that it just takes a long time to check -- to adjust all of them. On the Caribbean, I mean, if. you look at Puerto Rico, it's still not fully accessible. It's still largely out of power and while. the structure has not been hit as hard as expected, I mean, BI losses and later. development of losses is, of course, still very possible. So it's early days. But so far, I. mean, our loss estimates compared to what we have seen in loss advices and, of course,. talking to our clients at this point in time looks quite solid, I would say.. Roland Vogel. Maybe I can add here. We should, of course, bear in mind the comments we had made. about our retrocession being available. So if we just assume there would be negative. development there and the capacity would still be available, at least on the whole. account. As Uli mentioned, only Irma is slightly in it. So there would be a natural ceiling for. developments in our case.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. That's absolutely true. I mean, if we then look at the question of our own. retrocession, well, I mean, it's a difficult one for me to comment because we are actually. not too sure if I should be too open here because you want to play your cards closer to. the chest when you go into these kind of negotiations. But on a more broader note, I. our own retrocessions, of course, remains to be seen and that, of course, depends how. five years. So it's still in a rather positive position, I would say. Market overall, I mean, it's. facultative business, I mean, clearly points to increases. In loss-affected areas, clearly, I. mean, significant double-digit increases. But even having been recently been on a. conference in Asia or to the Asian clients that I have talked to, of course, point out that. they not live in the Caribbean nor in the U.S. nor Mexico. But they have some sympathy if. you tell them, well, look in 2011, you had the losses and the rest of the world market. increased in pricing as well. And I think they expect a similar movement for their markets. for the current year.. Operator. The next question is from William Hawkins of KBW.. William Hawkins. Just one question really. You've been very clear on what you said about the recapture for. U.S. mortality next year. I mean, I'm just wondering if we look beyond that, the EUR 200. million to EUR 300 million, is that a new range that you're also thinking about for 2019 and. 2020 because this is an ongoing issue. Or to pick up on what Kamran asked you, I mean,. are we having 1 down year and then hopefully everything sorted out and we're back to. normal, the EUR 300 million or even EUR 400 million that you referred to is the starting. point for 2018?. Ulrich Wallin. If things go according to plan, I mean, we have 1 down year because, I mean, the rating. actions that we are planning are really confined to 2018. So from that point of view, 2018. should be the most exposed year. If things go according to plan, of course, then from. uncertainties that we have seen on the loss development on the legacy U.S. mortality. business in the last couple of years, of course, the confidence with which I'm seeing that is. a little bit less than my predictions normally are. But as I said, if things go according to. plan, 2019 and '20, we should see significantly higher and higher EBIT.. William Hawkins. Got you. And given the -- I understand what you just said about wanting to be. conservative. I get that. But I think the first time I heard you mention in answer to Kamran's. question a EUR 400 million figure for underlying profits in 2019. The best I'd heard in the. past is EUR 350 million. Is that higher figure just reflecting the fact that the portfolio is. growing, you've got great financial solutions business? Presumably, that's what it is.. Ulrich Wallin. It's largely growing financial solutions business. It's also a growing international business.. And of course, it takes into account that the burden of the U.S. mortality business would. gradually come down.. Operator. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. I have two questions. My first question is coming back to the disposal of your equities. Can. you roughly at least quantify into how much additional volume growth this would translate,. given that you release capital, which you could then deploy into the -- I would assume into. the P&C business? Then secondly, also on the P&C business, there must be some sort of. underlying negative track from U.S. property per risk business in 2017 so far. Can you. quantify this? And also, say, whether this will be only a 2017 event or whether this is. something ongoing?. Ulrich Wallin. Well on the property per risk, yes, I mean, the combined ratio sits on that business. normally in the 70s. We are now looking more in the 90s there, which is a significant high. effect. I mean, there will be -- I mean, as this business is reacting to losses on an individual. basis because, I mean, it's largely, I would say, midmarket term product -- property per. risk business. I mean, we expect that to move back to the profitability that we have seen. over so many years in 2018, partly on the back of rate increases, which have nothing to do. with cat losses. But this business is just reactive to losses. In addition, it will also react to. the cat losses. So that -- we see that quite positive. I mean, on the amount of new. business that we can write based on the freed-up capital, that of course depends what. kind of business that is. I mean, of course, it's quite likely that we will increase our net risk. appetite for cat because there are a number of opportunities we are working at on the. cat side. That, of course, in volume terms will not be that significant. But it will be. significant in bottom line terms when you look at bottom lines based on the expected. losses. I think it's difficult to be more precise because there's different capital. requirements on different businesses.. Frank Kopfinger. And I think one should bear in mind that, yes, the disposal of the equities had different. reasons. That is one of which also without that disposals, we would not have held. impaired in our opportunities or potentials to take up market opportunities that is. definitely not the case. Of course, it increases flexibility a little bit more. So this is not a. prerequisite. It just helps. And it was also driven by variation considerations.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous.. Andrew James Ritchie. I have 2 quick questions. Curious, why you said earlier the K vehicle didn't pick up a lot of. the losses, a lot of losses were not subject to the K-Cession. I mean, given the K-Cession. has 40% quota share of your property exposed -- I'm sorry, cat-exposed business, why. was that? I'm just curious as to why that was the case. Secondly, I want more clarification. I. mean, you're implying that you will revisit the guidance -- 2018 guidance after 1/1 renewals.. But again, just to clarify, to the extent there is any harder pricing, currently, you wouldn't. really be earning materially improved margins until 2019. Isn't that the case?. Ulrich Wallin. Well on the first question, I mean, the K on the cat-exposed business, the K only takes the. property catastrophe business. So the property catastrophe excess of loss business,. largely writing the higher layer. They have, based on the current loss estimates, not been. affected. So should the losses grow. So will be the impact on the K transaction. But on the. losses, the K is not taking up that many losses. It, of course, works as a very efficient. shield when it comes to further loss development in the future on these losses. And the. second question on how the possible, I mean, margins from increased pricing will flow. through. Yes, partly, they will, of course, not flow through immediately into 2018. But partly. into 2019. But if you look at excess-of-loss treaties that are renewed at 1/1 at better prices,. of course, there you have an immediate effect because you get just more premium for. the same exposure. So I would say on the hardening market, as we said in previous years. about half of that -- 40% of that you see in first year and then the rest comes in the. second and the third year.. Andrew James Ritchie. I guess also there is going to be a bias to norm -- to harder prices in the later renewals. rather than the 1/1, which is why I was also thinking there could be more of a delay in the. (un) through?. Ulrich Wallin. Well of course. I mean, 65% of our treaty business renew at 1/1. And of course, we will. definitely strive to increase the prices also at 1/1 because that's the majority of the treaty. business they have to renew.. Andrew James Ritchie. How much of that is loss exposed do you think or has been exposed to losses?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, at this rate, difficult to say. But I think it's a smaller part of that. But I mean, as. we have seen in 2011, we expect pretty much also the loss-free business will be subject to. firming in terms and conditions.. Operator. The next question is from Michael Haid of Commerzbank.. Michael Hermann Haid. Just 2 questions relating to retro. First, on the K-Cession, is it then fair to assume that,. therefore, your K-Cession investors this Q3 was still only an earnings event and not a. capital event? And second question, regarding your expectations for your retro protection. for the renewal, what conclusions do you draw from the Q3 events? And how much your. retro was hit? I mean, I'm not asking in terms of what price expectations you have for the. renewal. But how do you want to change, if at all, your retro protection?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, as far as K is concerned, it's probably still a bit early to say if it was the capital. or an earnings event. But if it's in capital event on K, definitely not a significant one. K is, by. the way, largely renewed at this point in time already. The overall, I mean, structure of our. retrocessions that if you buy, I mean, depending, of course, on pricing, stay pretty much. unchanged. I mean, we will, of course, try to continue this buying aggregate excess of loss. maybe even a little bit more. And on the whole account, we expect that to be largely. unchanged, of course. There is no unlimited acceptability for us of rate increases. because, I mean, with our capital base, we can, of course, also increase our retentions.. But at the same time, I mean, this a reason we will, of course, of all our retrocession and. partners' renewal.. Operator. The next question is from Jochen Schmitt of Metzler.. Jochen Schmitt. I have one question on your investment book. What should we think about your strategic. an opportunistic basis? That's my question.. Ulrich Wallin. Well I think it's exactly how you described. You may remember that we entered into listed. equity in 2010. Once we went out of it because also the reinsurance opportunities were. remarkably higher. We always said that we are open and willing to invest again if. opportunities arise, then we did that up to an amount of 2% of the overall portfolio. That. is still -- or developed into nearly EUR 1 billion. But we should bear in mind, it was never. more than 2%. So the -- we could run our investment portfolio and we have run it also with. -- in good terms also without the equities. So in that regard, nothing has really changed. If. you invest in equity -- listed equities and you assume that there will be evaluation. increases in the future, then sometimes there is a time to harvest those. And this is what. we did in conjunction with all the other good reasons to do that. And moreover, we are -we have not changed our appetite in our strategy. So we will use opportunities to go in.. And if that develops exactly as it did before, there will be a time to harvest gains again.. Operator. The next question is from Jonny Urwin of UBS.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. Just one from me please. Just thinking back to your retro program. I mean, I guess, you're. going to want to get that all nailed down, sorted, renewed before you think about how. much you want to write at 1/1. And what do you want to do to your cap appetites and what. I have been hearing in the market is that in this phase that it's going to be quite late. renewal given the uncertainty around losses. The question is how quickly do you think. you'll be able to get certainty around your retro program and get it renewed. Will you be. ahead of the pack perhaps, given it's been less impacted than elsewhere?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I would say on our main facility, the K transaction, we already have certainty. So I. mean that's done. And the rest, I mean, of course, we haven't as yet went to the market. for quotation. But there is a centerpiece already in place. I mean, we are less concerned. with that.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard of HSBC.. Thomas Fossard. Two questions left on my side. First one will be on the S&P rating. So Ulrich, in your. preliminary statement, you indicated that S&P has recently updated your rating. Have you. also closed the discussion with them on how much excess capital you're holding on your. AA rating level? And the second question will be on the life U.S. mortality recapture for the. EUR 45 million negative impact on an IFRS basis. Could you disclose whether these in. reverse or quantify how much was the positive impact on an economic basis so EUR 72. million or EUR 72 million like?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, on -- if I may take the later one, I mean, we would have to say that, I mean,. this recapture was fully in line with our plan of the rate increases that we proposed there.. Therefore, a part of that has already been taken into account on the future management. actions at the end of 2016. So that the movement in the economic balance sheet for 2017. on this particular one will not be all that large. But it shows that the future management. actions that we contemplate are actually very reliable and we are able to execute pretty. much in accordance to this plan. I mean, the overall future losses that we avoided that way. were actually quite significant.. Roland Vogel. If I may take the Standard & Poor's question. I think what we have to bear in mind that the. Standard & Poor's has changed their treatment in the models, especially of the. reinsurance industry to some extent. So the world how we view excess capital has. changed in two respects. First of all, we are still in communication with Standard & Poor's. about some of the changes, which have cost us excess capital. And on the other hand, we. were living in a world where we assumed that, of course, for a AA; rating, we do need as. reinsurers based on the volatility and the industry risk, we would have to always have a. AAA capitalization. So the relationship between the two. So what we have and what we. really need to stay there has changed. And we are still in discussions with Standard &. Poor's how this will look like. So you could argue from a pure technical standpoint, this has. decreased to some extent, the excess capital. On the other hand, the hurdle we have to. jump over to stay at a AA; rating seems to have decreased also. So that was a little bit of. long-winded answer to your question. But as far as we see and with the confirmation of. the rating where we are, we feel comfortable where we are with our capital position with. Standard & Poor's today. To quote a number as we did before, I wouldn't be brave. enough today.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. And there are still some moving parts in. Maybe I would say mid next year, we should. -- the fog should have lifted, let's put it that way.. Thomas Fossard. Okay, sure. And just one additional point around where is the part of the changing model,. which is potentially the most costly or expensive for you? Is that on the P&C side or is that. on the mortality side of things?. Ulrich Wallin. No. It's not on the mortality. It's more on the longevity side. It's also a concept that S&P. runs it by, I mean, category of risks. They look at your internal model and always takes the. higher number of their own assessment and your assessment within the internal model,. of course, without using the same correlation metrics in respect of the diversification. benefit.. Thomas Fossard. Okay. So more on the life than on the P&C for the time being.. Operator. The next question is from Roland PfÃ¤nder of ODDO BHF.. Roland Pf Ã¤nder. Two questions from my side, please. Did you see business opportunities in the shorter. frame following these net cat losses? Did you see, for example, backup covers already?. And secondly, you spoke about positive spillover effect to loss-free lines. So which lines. do you think will be most exposed to maybe price increases going forward?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, we have, of course, already written some backup covers. I mean, this is not. huge. I mean, this is just individual backup covers that have been in the market, that some. of them we wrote, some of them we didn't write. As far as the spillover effect, I mean, I. pretty much view the situation a little bit similar to what we have seen in 2011. And if you. remember in 2012 following the 2011 losses, that the impact was not too dissimilar from. what we see this year. We saw basically an overall price increase somewhere of 7%, I. would say. And if you look at the overall business, that should be achievable this time. around as well. That, of course, means that loss-affected businesses have significantly. higher rate increases. And the rest of the businesses would really be dependent on profit. prospects and, of course, also I mean the experience of that business, you will have. differential, I mean, methods of rate increases of those. Of course, I mean, if business is. marginable at current rate, that will get higher rate increases if loss free compared to. business that is extremely profitable where the rate increases may actually be not as. pronounced, if at all. But it really depends on the individual experience and the profitability. of the business. But needless to say, it would mean overall also on the loss-free business,. we will see rate increases.. Operator. The next question is a follow-up of Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. The follow-up question is on the retro again. If K series and whole account both have not. been severely -- I mean, not been hit too much. There is still around EUR 700 million of. retro, which is -- or some kind of offset, which has come in. And I'm a bit confused as to. what could have driven that because in the past, you have provided some scenarios,. maybe 3 or four years ago at your Investor Day, which also included premiums in and out?. Is there some such calculation behind these numbers? Or is it really that there is some. retro. But we don't know or you're not disclosing where it is today?. Ulrich Wallin. No. These numbers are not heavily affected by -- I mean, it's not taking into account the. cat premium and deducting it from the losses as you do if you look at the capital impact.. This includes to some extent reinstatement premiums. But I have to say that. reinstatement premiums in and out are quite similar. If at all, in is a little bit higher than out. because the majority of the recoveries from the retrocession is either K, where we are. not, of course, paying retrocession or the aggregate excess of loss, where we are not. paying reinstatement premiums as well. Reinstatement premiums are only being paid on. the partly affected whole account. I mean, of course, the remainder of the coverage is still. in place. It's very comforting for us because, I mean, should there be a movement in. reported loss numbers that would have us to adjust our figure's output on a gross basis.. As Roland already alluded to, we would be pretty well protected on a net basis for quite a. bit of development there. I mean, the reason that the retro program wasn't that effective. was really, the -- I mean, the significant frequency of losses. So I mean the whole account,. of course, it's really geared to larger -- for the most part, to larger individual losses, let's. say, comes in the Mexican earthquake or even the Harvey. So that's the reason why it's. only hit by Irma.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) The next question is again a follow-up of Michael Haid of. Commerzbank.. Michael Hermann Haid. Two additional questions. Maybe I missed it. But can you say a word on how the solvency. ratio could have developed in the Third Quarter? I assume that with a profit and with the. release of risk capital from the liquidation of the equity portfolio, it should have increased.. Second question, also relating to the liquidation of the equity portfolio, I saw that you. reinvested some of the money in government bonds. Can you say in what government. bonds you invested in and what the reinvestment rate of this would be?. Ulrich Wallin. Well if I take the first one. Well it looks at this point in time as if the solvency ratio on the. Third Quarter for the group would actually increase rather than decrease. I mean, there. are lots of, I mean, moving parts in a Solvency II solvency ratio. But it's also related to. currencies and interest rates and stuff. But at this point in time, it looks as if there's an. increase in the solvency ratio. That also, of course, has to do with the fact that we have. our operational risk model being approved now. So from that point of view on a group. basis, we would expect that the probability of an increased solvency ratio is higher than. the probability of a decreased solvency ratio.. Roland Vogel. But let me comment on the reinvestment yields and the govies. So Mike, I don't think that. you had the opportunity to be at the Investor's Day, where I showed a little bit the. reinvestment yields also in respect of maturities and currencies and the dependencies. So. we will, of course, invest currency-wise. I think also the equity portfolio did follow the over. -- at least, in overall terms the currency composition. So the largest reinvestment will be in. the U.S. dollars. We will also take longer-term maturities to see the maturity is a little bit on. the govies side to avoid very low interest rates. The same would be true for the euro. investment as well. We should also bear in mind. And I said that before that we will stay or. we will keep the powder dry over the course of the renewal season. After that, we will. have to decide and one should assume today that the reinvestment of these monies. follows the overall reinvestments on average as well.. Michael Hermann Haid. Okay. Can you remind us again what the operational risk could imply on your -- how much. of percentage points in the solvency ratio?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I think it's just shy of 20% if I remember that correctly.. Operator. The next question is from James Oram of Citigroup.. James R Oram. This is James Oram from Citi. And I've got 2 questions, please. In your report, you. mentioned U.K. motors is one of the areas where you expect to see price increases next. year. It seems there's still quite a lot of debate over the extent to this increases that we. might see and I just wonder how renewal discussions had progressed so far and what. you're seeing there. And the second question was at the Investor Day, you suggested it. was still too early to comment on potential developments in equalization reserve. I just. wondered if you had a clearer picture now. You've got more precise loss estimates for. your exposures.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. As your second question is a difficult one, I would leave that to Roland, of course.. The first one on the U.K. motors is a slightly easier one. So I take that. Yes, I mean, we see. significant increases on the U.K. motor excess of losses, where we play with just an excess. of EUR 5 million, which in a launch have been pretty much doubling in pricing in. reinsurance rate, coupled with the increases in the primary business. So we have more. than twice the price on those. However, I have to say that there is -- on most of them, we. have adjustment clause that in case the Ogden rate changed again, the pricing will be. reviewed. Because, I mean, the exposure on the upper layers, which we are playing is, of. course, very much dependent on the Ogden rate. So I mean, if you have a layer excess of. EUR 10 million and the rate changes back, say, from minus 0.75 to 0.5 positive, it has a. major effect on the expected losses. It will also, of course, has a major effect on our. reserves we have quoted there. But it will then also be reviewed. The pricing rates will. then be reviewed again.. Roland Vogel. So with the more difficult question, the very quick answer could be, no we have not. reviewed or made an additional estimate of the development of the equalization reserve.. 6 weeks or 7 weeks before the end of the year, that exercise wouldn't make too much. sense. I would still say that you should bear in mind that the addition and the releases. from the equalization reserve to some extent can be managed and steered. They, of. course, have an impact on the German GAAP accounting of the Hannover Re SE. But with. the retained earnings and the profits carried forward, which we have and the. opportunities to steer that, I would assume this really does not drive our management. decisions to such a large extent.. Operator. There are no further questions. I hand back to the speakers.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you very much. Thanks for listening to our conference call. And I wish you all a. very nice day.",20171108_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2017-11-8_SD000000002868833083.pdf,2017-11-08
5,"Good afternoon everybody here in Frankfurt, and good afternoon to all those joining us. via the Internet. Welcome to Hannover Re's Analyst Conference. It's a pleasure for me to. see that so many have taken up our invitation. And we are very delighted to present you. the figures for 2015 in greater detail, which we have published this morning.. I must say I'm impressed to see that you, as our analysts, have proven to be very accurate. in estimating our results and being very close to our actual numbers, at least, in most. cases. Today, we offer also a dial-in option for all those who are not able to participate. here physically in Frankfurt. And as a reminder the dial-in participants will be in a listen. mode only during the presentations.. I also like to draw your attention to the feedback questionnaire on your table, or which we. have distributed in advance. As you may know, we appreciate your remarks, and it lays the. foundation for preparing the upcoming Investors' Day in October. You may either leave. that feedback form on the table or send it in to our Investors Relations team.. First of all, Ulrich Wallin, our CEO, will kick things off with a brief overview of the financial. year 2015; and Roland Vogel, our CFO, will then move on to present the financials in. detail. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond at length to all your questions.. And I also would like to point out that you please wait for the microphone before asking a. question, so that everybody is able to hear your question, even those who are not in the. room.. On that note, I'm delighted to hand over to Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, Karl, and good afternoon. Welcome to Hannover Re's analysts'. conference for the year 2015, which has been a good year for Hannover Re. We had the. fourth consecutive record year in a row. And for the first time in the history of the. company, we reached a net profit in excess of €1 billion, being €1.15 billion, which is an. increase of almost 17% compared to the already very good result in 2014.. With this good result, we will also increase our dividend provided that the AGM agrees to. that. And we have – we'll be proposing to the AGM to raise both the basic dividend from. €3 to €3.25, as well as the special dividend from €1.25 to €1.50. So, all in all, from €4.25 to. €4.75.. Not only has the result been good, also, the capital has grown again by 7% despite the. fact that we see widening of the credit spreads and the increase in interest rates. particular in the U.S dollar. Last year, the OCI effect is negative, and we have paid more. than €500 million in dividends last year. However, due to the high profitability, also, the. capital has increased. The book value per share stands at around €67.. Also, the return on equity continues to be at acceptable level. We have exactly the same. number that we had last year of 14.7%, which, of course, is well above our minimum. requirement which is of course 900 base point excess risk free.. You can see here on the slide that we see that 2015 is an excellent foundation for 2016.. So, you can see that we are quite bullish for our 2016 results as well. And I'd like to briefly. explain why we're saying that the foundation that we have laid in 2015 bodes well for. good result in 2016.. First of all, if I look at the P&C business, we have improved the combined ratio slightly. compared to last year 2014. However the confidence level has further increased. In other. words, the redundancies of our loss reserves according to early calculations by third. parties as well as our own actuaries has actually improved quite remarkably compared to. 2014. This is very positive for us because due to the soft market in the P&C business, we. were expecting actually a stable situation here at best, or even a slight reduction. Now. that we have that increase, we feel that it should give us another two years of room to. weather the storm of the continued soft market.. Second point, on the Life & Health business. In 2015, we generated a very good result.. EBIT €404 million, €290 million after tax profit. However, we also significantly reduced the. collateral costs of our U.S. mortality business and also has increased rates on that. business in BAT (07:20). So, that means that on a like-for-like basis, we have improved the. underlying profitability of our Life & Health business, so we can expect that the trend of. continued profitability of Life & Health should continue into 2016 and beyond.. I should, however, mention a word of caution here. The actual 2015 result is above the. trend line and the reason for that is that we have the extraordinary profits, also nonrecurring profits on our financial solution business, particular, the breakup fee that we. were pointing out to you in the first quarter. But there were also more positive effects on. the financial solution business. Yes, we had negative effects as well, also negative oneoffs, particular, as a result of our French business, which actually is a negative deviation to. last year of around €70 million. But the positive effects clearly outweigh the negatives and,. therefore, I say that we are a little bit above the trend line on the Life & Health in 2015.. On our investment side of the business, again, 2015, an outstanding result. However, we. also managed to further increase the assets under management due to continued very. positive cash flow. Actually, Roland would show you that, in that respect, 2015 was a. marked improvement compared to the already very good results in 2014.. Of course, the increased assets under management, even with the lower interest rates. would allow us to keep the absolute returns of our investment portfolio at – in historic. level, in absolute terms that we have seen over the last few years. So, all in all, I would. summarize that we had a very good result in 2015, and we also laid the basis in 2015 for. good result in 2016 as well.. And on that rather positive note, I will hand over to Roland to give you all the details.. Roland Vogel. Thank you, Uli. And I will try to keep it on a positive note. We start with the cash flow, as Uli. mentioned. Here, you see that 2015 ended with €2.6 billion. Here, for the first time, we. did something, which we usually not do, we adjusted the number. If you look at the cash. flow statement of the Annual Report, you will find €3.1 billion. The reason for that inflated. number in the cash flow statement was a Chinese financial deal, where we received, just. more by coincidence, the money before the balance sheet date.. We will payout that money to reposessionaires in Q1 & Q2, most likely, so we did not feel. that this is real operative cash flow. This is why we adjusted the number for 2015. Still with. the €2.6 billion, very positive. This is, of course, driven by good results on the underwriting. side as well as on the investment side. Still it's also a little bit inflated by the currency. exchange rates, which also helped the cash flow number to improve and was – if it wasn't. there 2012, this would have been in another record number.. This number directly supports the right-hand side. The assets under our management, by. the way, here, we did not adjust for the €500 million. We felt it is not that material for that. number. We could have even adjusted the ROI calculation, which would have benefited. from that adjustment. This is something we did not do. We only wanted to make you. aware that the cash flow would not be sustainable over €3 billion. Here, again, it was also. already mentioned, nearly €40 billion to be invested into – also into the future, which. should support the net investment income for the future as well.. Then on the next page the policyholders' surplus, which includes the hybrids as well as the. minorities and the shareholder's equity, shareholder's equity up by 6%. That is something. which improves our balance sheet as the policyholders' surplus only up you could say by a. slight €30 million. The reason for that is that we called one of our hybrid bonds in the. second quarter last year. And the €1.5 billion here should be the longer run rate. It still. leaves us with a lot of additional flexibility to issue more hybrid if we want to. Right now,. we don't have any plan to do that, but we would be in a position to do that.. You see the components of the change of the shareholder's equity on the right-hand side. of that slide. The net income, of course, a positive, and the dividend payment €513 million. last year for the running year based on the announcement of Uli, with the €4.75. This. number will increase to €573 million. So, it is an increase over and above that.. You see that the change in unrealized gains and losses went downwards by €460 million. that is driven by some rate increases and the increase in credit spreads. You know that we. have, in general, a held-to-maturity portfolio that is something, which, of course, brings. some volatility to the shareholder's equity number. But on the opposite side, we have the. currency exchange rates, so all the equities holdings in our subsidiaries are then. translated from U.S. dollar into the euro. And here we had a positive of €333 million, which. brought us over and above €8 billion in shareholders' equity by the end of last year.. There is, I think, no need to repeat what Uli already had explained around our dividend. policy. It says in place. I might take that opportunity to update you a little bit on my. presentation. I think it was in this room or the room next door in – from October, when I. referred to our German GAAP results. So, the German GAAP results for the holding. company, or the operated holding company, was €900 million. We used to – this. opportunity to transfer €250 million to retained earnings. And we have established based. on the dividend the proposal – a profit carryforward from – of another €83 million. So, also. the strength of the German balance sheet – the German GAAP balance sheet is improved. – has improved remarkably.. Why did we increase the basis dividend to €3.25. If you do the math and apply a 40%. payout ratio, that would – or approximately 40% payout ratio, that will bring you up to. around €1 billion, and I think this the message we have with us here, that the long-term. sustainable earnings capability of the company, we feel, should be around $1 billion going. forward.. Return on equity, you see that our earnings power has kept up with the increase in capital. over time. That leads to the fact that we could maintain the ROE at 14.7%. You see on the. right-hand side the on-average numbers for 15 years, for 10 years and for five years. By. the way, the 15-year average should improve next year, when we can delete out 2001,. with WTC, which, of course, is a little bit – dilutes that number this year. Overall, the. message is we have kept the ROE at 14.7%. The hurdle decreased from as you can see. 10.7% to 10.2%, so you could argue that the marginal profitability of the company has. increased.. ROE in comparison with the friendly competition, you see that in 2015 we are number one. again. That is also true for the on-average number, which we usually take as a basis for. the ranking here on the right-hand side, by quite some margin, more than 200 basis. points margin in front of the number two.. On this slide you can also see that the majority of the peers we are referring to on this. slide has decreasing ROEs. And that is, of course, also driven by increasing capital. numbers. But this is also the way we try to manage it to have the capital increase in line. with the earnings power and the earnings increase, which we have been showing. And so. far, we are happy to look at that ranking. And we will do everything to show you a. comparable picture next year.. I think on a group level, there is not a lot to add. We will come to some of the details in a. second. Perhaps, it should be mentioned that the call of the hybrid has, of course,. decreased the interest payment that is only true for a good half year on this page. As far. as I remember, the planned number for next year was a little bit more than €70 million. So,. at least also the call of the hybrid will also decrease that burden here even a little bit. more.. Other expenses are down from last year. Still, we should bear in mind that they are a little. bit better, a little bit above the run rate. We are still benefiting from currency exchange. rate gains. You know that our strategy would be to have a neutral number here. Already,. last year, or the year before last year and in 2015, we had a positive currency exchange. rate effect in the other income, so that is something which is not really sustainable.. What is sustainable is the deduction of LoC costs, so we decreased the volumes of LoCs. outstanding. And we have also decreased the interest payments on these LoCs, so that is. something which is sustainable. And we also have increased fee income of the mostly Life. & Health deposited accounting contracts. And also that should be a positive number in the. future, in the other income and expenses line.. Moreover, you also might ask as to why the tax ratio has increased. We usually say that. 25% is a good run rate for the tax rate. Last year we were below. This year we are a little. bit above. All the Germans might have heard that for instance Hanover, as a city, has. increased trade tax by only a small – from 460 basis points to 480 basis points. But as you. know, we have to calculate deferred taxes, and we have to calculate the deferred taxes.. For instance, on the equalization reserve, volumes this more than €4 billion. And if you. only apply a brief increase in trade tax, that results in more than €25 million burden here.. This is not cash out, this is future taxes to be paid, but that I think attributed 1.6. percentage points of that. And then also, there is one instance, where we put up some. tax provisions to reflect a potential risk from the ruling of the German high tax court.. Overall, this does not change the picture. The expected run rate would still be 25%.. Now on the non-life side, I think Uli has already mentioned various points here. We will. come to the areas of growth in a second. What happened to reserves, I think that is. usually one of the major interest. Here, we had a very positive run-off result. If you open. up the Annual Report, we are referring to approximately €500 million in positive run-off.. That would lead to the assumption that, potentially, redundancies might have decreased. which was not the case, as Uli elaborated on already. So, we had, especially positive runoff effects from property lines. These were the lines where you look at single events, you. set up reserves.. Usually, the assumptions are that these are best estimates reserves. Still, these losses ran. off very positively. And then so far, we had a positive run-off plus. This did not decrease. redundancies. And we looked at the current year last year. Very conservatively, one more. time, you will also see that we looked at year 2014 a little bit more conservatively. So, in. that regard, we could capitalize on that positive run-off and still increase our redundant. loss reserves, remarkably, to say some examples, so for instance, Deepwater Horizon, Air. France, these were – Sandy, these were losses where we could release reserves. And we. will also see that on the next page here in a second.. I think that should be it. If we look at the lines of business, and the P&C segment, this. shows you that the margins between the MtCR, our Maximum tolerable Combined Ratio. and the combined ratios, which we have realized are getting narrower. You see that. Marine is a little above, driven by some of the run-offs. Same is true for Aviation. Overall,. again, it's getting more narrow. And we – to have the redundant reserves especially in that. segment gives us some relief. Still, overall, you see that with an EBIT margin of 16.6%, we. are still looking at a very profitable diversified business group. And based on the. assumption that we should be able to achieve that also next year, we are quite happy with. the achievement we see here. And, of course, it was a record result for the P&C segment. as such.. Areas of growth, you see North America has been an area of growth. We also see growth. opportunities into the future. Continental Europe, very competitive already last year.. Marine, Aviation show growth numbers, might be surprising, because we always say that. competition is tough. And especially in Aviation, we have decreased our market share. If. these numbers are not adjusted for currency exchange rates on the line of business level,. this is difficult to do. So in real terms one should assume that Aviation and Marine have. been showing in real term, decreasing numbers.. What is also worth mentioning, I think the credit and surety line looks a little bit worst then. it was. So, we also here, we have added redundant reserves. So, we see that this line is. still profitable into the future. It might not grow that much. It has been growing nicely last. year, as for instance, has our structured reinsurance in ILS. This is where we take and. money ceded to the markets relatively risk free. So very, very profitable and successful. last year.. Large losses, not a lot to say here. We had expected €690 million, €573 million have. materialized so approximately €120 million below budget. That is already for quite – for. four years now in a row. You see that we are below budget. And this is, of course, the. explanation for the competition in the cat business, which we're seeing. And this is also. the reason why we do not grow that much and have also increased our repossessions a. little bit.. The list of large losses shows a very mix picture, very long for catastrophes as well as for. man-made losses, but so high-frequency, low-severity, you could argue. If we add up all. the natural catastrophes, we are far below our loss expectations. If we add up all the manmade losses we are far, far robust. Overall, as mentioned, we are below the line.. Tianjin, of course, the most outstanding last year €111 million net for our share. We have to. accept that we have nearly paid, we have nearly not paid any losses out. We have. received some loss advises, so we will have to find out. We still feel that we are very. conservative – that we are conservatively reserved here in the future.. So, maybe the most surprising positive note, the €400 million – or more than €400 million. EBIT for our Life & Health. The fourth quarter, as you see, was an underwriting result of. €83 million, and especially a positive one. Uli mentioned already one one-off, which was. also driven by the financial solutions segment, which has improved not the net investment. income, but the underwriting result. We also had some negatives before. We mentioned. that U.S. motility running off below expectations, our result from France.. Overall, if you look at the net underwriting result for the full year, there is something which. should be achievable also in the future. Here, I would say, it's a little bit an offset between. positives and negatives and the run rate. It – we mentioned the €39 million there from the. termination fee, which is in the net investment line. That is something which is not. sustainable into the future. If we look at the EBIT margins by segment, you see financial. solutions, again, very, very profitable. And we also see that profitability into the future.. Longevity, here we had a positive run-off and also positive results from one special. relation, and that has improved results here remarkably. Mortality, still a little bit below the. run rate. We've discussed that before. We have improved the LOC costs. We have. implemented rate increases, so the run rate should be better into the future. Will this be a. contributor to outperform into the future? Most likely not. Again, overall, very positive and. so far with an EBIT improvement by more than 50%, something which is worth. mentioning.. The next page you might have recognized that we have no MCEV numbers with us. We. did the math internally and you will remember that the VNB, the value of new business, is. the only key figure, which is part of our target matrix. This is why we have implemented or. why we reported here. We will, as from this year onwards, no longer report about MCEV.. We will substitute that by the numbers and key figures from the economic balance sheet,. which will be available even with our auditors approving the math as from next year. This. year, we have the VNB with us. As you see – as you can see, very productive last year.. On a like-for-like basis, VNB improved from €448 million to €489 million. Now, as we are. preparing a Solvency-based reporting, we have no longer applied the 4.5% capital cost. ratio, which is suggested by the CFO Forum, but we've changed that to the 6% cost of. capital ratio, which is required by the Solvency II calculation. That decreases that number. then to €543 million.. As you can see here, on the right hand side, this number was made up of the lines which. have contributed or usually the long tail lines, of course, where you have a long stream of. positive cash flows in the future that is true for the longevity business. Here, we have. entered into a few new deals, especially from the UK, but also Asia and other countries.. We have been growing nicely in our organic growth business in the U.S. And also, the. financial solutions business in the U.S. contributes to this VNB. So, this should be another. good basis for future profits. But apart from that, no other MCEV calculations anymore –. or publications anymore.. The third business group, as you can see here, the investment income growth, despite. lower realizations. I think that is the sweet point for ROI. On an ordinary income side, it's a. little bit inflated by the €39 million from that life & health termination fee. But even if you. take that out, that reflects 10 basis points, it would be €3.3 million (33;59) so a significant. achievement, and this was supported especially by our private equity portfolio, where we. had distributions from funds also from our real estate portfolio and, of course, the. increased volumes which we had available.. Realized gains-losses (34:22), slightly down, still on a higher level. This – it was not in the. intention to harvest gains here, but we have also changed our reporting currency of our. Irish company. And with that, associated was a transfer of €1.5 billion from euro into the. dollar, so we had to sell, we had to reinvest and that led to realizations and then so far. also to realize gains.. Impairments, I think more than half of that is still ordinary depreciation on our investment –. on our real estate portfolio. So, in that regard, nothing to write home about with regard to. any impairments or depreciations. A neutral change in fair value line, which has also. appreciated. This is comprised of a negative ModCo derivative that was mitigated by the. positive effect of some other derivatives. Overall, again, a neutral impact.. So, with 3.4% ROI, and here I can only mention one more time, the ROI here for Hannover. Re is calculated using balance sheet numbers so you can take the assets under own – on. our own management from the balance sheet, incoming period and outgoing period. divide them by two, take the investment income and do the math. I think some of other. companies do the calculation differently. Here, it is really transparent and, I would say,. rather conservative.. The balance sheet, here, we have the decrease of the OCI, which has already been. mentioned. Some increases in interest rates and the widening of credit spreads has led to. that decrease. Again, it does not really affect us that much. We have this held-to-maturity. bucket, and this just is a normal volatility which we usually see.. We have added one slide, and you might tell us if you like it or not. This compares a little. bit to where we are invested and where the investment income comes from. So, on the. right-hand side you can for instance see that we have €43 million invested in governments. and semi-governments and only 25% of the net income stems from that source. You can. also see here, of course, the high flier is – in 2015 was a private equity portfolio where we. had invested 2% of our invested assets, but we have a contribution of 9% to the ordinary. income.. So, this is not the usual run rate, I would say. This is a little bit inflated, but still very positive.. The other outstanding factor you see is for real estate you see 4% portion, in the. investment portfolio 11%. Here we have to bear in mind that this is before depreciation. and the ordinary costs. And so, far it's a little bit inflated, but it's still far above average. If. you look at the corporate's 34%, part of the investment is 37% of the ordinary income. split.. I think we have already mentioned that the composition of the portfolio didn't change that. much. We have explained this barbell strategy, which we are following a little bit to invest. more on the safe side to increase liquidity and therefore also take a little bit more risk on. the lower quality side. You see that the governments here increased from 21% to 26%,. the covered bonds go down from 14% to 10% and the non-investment rate investments. do increase slightly. That is a reflection of that strategy.. There's one additional information. It used to be the topic of the last investor conferences. and road shows, which we did. This is why we've added this one or these two pictures.. Here, you see the sector split of our corporate exposures and on the right-hand side what. of this corporate exposure is invested in oil and gas and also the quality of these. investments, as you can see here €800 million exposure into oil and gas related issuers,. €52 million of that high yield very diversified, €230 million in BBBs.. We are talking about more than 100 names for this portfolio, so the average investment is. less than €8 million. And of course, we have higher investments in better qualities and. lower investments in lower qualities. So, we do not see that as any remarkable exposure. which could materially affect us.. And I think that concludes my portion, and I'll leave the target matrix, as always, to the. CEO.. Ulrich Wallin. year. We outperformed on almost all of our targets, some very remarkably like the value. of new business. Well, I mean, of course, the return on equity and all the other ones. So,. target matrix, everything is fine, confirms a good year.. If I then come to what's to be expected for 2016, I also have a chart here, which is not too. dissimilar to the one that Roland showed you, and I will try to keep it short and tell you. things that are in line with those that Roland told you.. This is the expectation here for 2016. And if you look at North America, we expect. premium growth, and we also expect good profitability. And the basis for that is our very. broad book of business. We have more than 600 insurance companies that we do. business with in the U.S. and our growth is broad based. I mean, we are not, for the most. part, writing single large fees in order to stimulate growth and this is particularly true for. our casualty business.. The reason for that is that in the last soft market in the late 1990s, we did actually write. some large facilities and proportionate casualty treaties, which due to the low rates that. we (42:08) have created some problems in the run-off. Therefore, we have rules that. none of the casualty treaties that we write should be a significant portion of our overall. U.S. casualty book. And that is the reason why we grow our casualty business with many. individual (42:31) treaties rather than with a few very big ones. Slightly different on the. property side, which is shorter tail, you'll know (42:38) more quickly where you are. So,. there, we are more willing to write also single larger treaties, which we actually had done. last year and we most likely will continue to do this year.. Continental Europe, different picture. In Germany, we see increased retentions, which put. pressure on the income. On the other hand, the rating and environment in Germany is still. quite positive. So, from a profitability point of view, we are satisfied with Germany. The. rest of Continental Europe, extremely competitive, rates are under pressure and so is the. profitability, therefore we reduced our involvement in the rest of Continental Europe.. If you look at the specialty lines, you can see that we are reducing our premium in marine.. We also reduced the rates. However, we keep the quality of the business quite high due. to selective underwriting. And so, we are very positive from the quality of our marine. book, which almost exclusively is in excess of loss book. And we have to make sure that. the book is clean. So, if you don't accept non-marine cat exposure into it and therefore. our underwriters. And having been underwriting the marine business myself, I'm happy. there's a book that we've got there.. It's not the same case with Aviation, where it will be not be long before we pay the. airlines for the privilege of insuring them. The rates on aviation continued to slide. And I. would say – it's fair to say that at the expected losses with the current rating level and this. unfortunately is also true for the aviation excessive loss, we would have to expect a result. definitely on the cost of capital.. As a result and we have shown you that in the renewal call, we have reduced our premium. volume and market share in that area. While we have on the calamity (44:54) basis, we. have the saving of that line of businesses that we have the highest level of redundant. reserves on aviation compared to all the other classes in relative terms. So, the calamity. year (45:12) results are likely continued to be acceptable.. Credit and surety, with (45:20) our growth of the business in 2009, we have reached the. us to keep the book and also to keep good margins for our shares in that business.. Therefore, we expect that the volume will be rather stable, but that we will continue to. earn margins well in excess of the cost of capital. UK has a little bit of mixed picture on the. regional site. (45:55) We are happy with our book, but the market is very competitive and. I'm talking non-property catastrophe here.. We think that we have a good quality book, which however is not growing due to the soft. market. It's different on our primary business, which is allocated here as well. That book of. business is growing, and we also feel it grows profitably, but it is rather in specialty lines. book.. Facultative, the same applies, what I have told you, to the marine business. We have been. very selective. We will see some decrease in premium in the current year due to selective. underwriting, but we feel that the quality of the book is very good and that we will see. good profitability of that business. That already has been very evident in 2015, where we. managed to improve the combined ratio quite significantly as compared to 2014 despite. the reduced rates and pressures from the soft market.. Worldwide treaty, rather a large block of business with differing movements. We. continued to grow on our agricultural business. We also have, over the last couple of. years, significantly improved the profitability of that business, and we expect that to. continue into the current year. We also have grown our business in China, where we have. seen good double-digit growth. And also, in Southeast Asia, growth has been quite good.. In the more established markets, like Southern Europe, parts of Latin America and also. what we expect to see in Japan, it's the other way around as their volume would reduce. as the result of competitive market pressures. However, overall, the book is very well. diversified, and we are optimistic and quite confident that we will continue to see good. results from that book.. Catastrophe excessive loss, which we largely write from Bermuda, again, like aviation, we. believe that if we have the losses at the level of the actuality (48:35) calculated expected. have reduced our volumes there. The (48:48) business line is that – despite the fact that. the rates have come down, the probability set on a 12 months arrive (48:55) and you will. borrowed from the future, I would say, because, I mean, if the actuaries are right, in the. where this line of business will actually reduce or see losses. (49:24). retrocession and an enlarged rather conservative loss reserves on the past losses.. Structured reinsurance and ILS, I mean, we will see some reductions in the ILS because. also our partners find it difficult to generate sufficient amount of business. On the. structured reinsurance, of course, it's more bulky business. There are some larger. transactions, which are either they are not however low risk – in this area of the business. and rather secure profitability.. So, overall, you can see that despite the soft market, despite the fact that retentions are. increased in part, we still feel that our very well diversified books gives us good. opportunity also in the current year to earn a profit in excess of the cost of capital and. naturally the run-off result we expect to continue to be positive as well.. If I come to life & health, as the star (50:46) of the profitability in 2015, it has of course. been the financial solutions business and we expect that to continue into the current year. even without one-off positive effects. It's a bit of a mixed bag on the one hand. We have. the capital relief transactions, which are not very premium heavy so – which are either –. the majority of them are actually either there's a premium that we expect a profit or. they're deposit accounted or even are accounted as investments, this book of business is. actually increasing – continues to increase in size, and we expect the profitability to. increase outside the one-off in fact (51:43) as well.. The other part of that business is cash financing. For a different business, here, we finance. the acquisition costs or embedded value. This business would normally show quite a lot of. premium, hence the margin on the premium would not be very large for the most part.. growing, therefore you can see the volume arrows pointing upwards here. This is on. some special relationships, where we develop business with partners and where we also. finance the protection costs.. Overall, we see the profitability very positive with that business. Longevity is another area,. where we see growth. Demand for longevity transactions, largely in the UK, but. increasingly also outside the UK is increasing, but so is the competition. I mean, that. business has become quite competitive. We write it for many years now. We do not. compete on price in this business. We compete on deal certainty and the speed of. transactions because we have quite some respect towards this business due to the long. run-off of that business. But with our market position, we still expect growth from that. business.. Mortality and morbidity, we expect reduced volume. This is due to the fact that some. large transactions will discontinue, and this is both on some Australian group business as. well as some business out of China, where we expect that's also will not be renewed, but. we expect at the same time that the results will be improving and this is of course on the. U.S. mortality because of reduced collateral cost rate increases and also in the rest of the. world, particularly on the – on those two classes, we see increase of simple profitable. business where we will see improved profitability. That's the expectation more in detail. for 2016.. If we then put it into the guidance 2016, bottom line is more important than top line.. therefore we expect premium income stable or even a modest reduction. Return on. investment, 2.9%, as Roland already pointed out, is expected for the current year, so that. should allow us to keep the absolute return on investment at an acceptable level. We. have changed the guidance a little bit for the group net income because we were saying. when we first guided the third quarter figures, that should be around €250 million.. Now, we're a little bit more optimistic and this on the basis of what we have seen on the. full year results for 2015. We say that we should see at least €250 million always provided. that the large losses and the increased large loss budget of €825 million and there's no. dislocation in the capital markets, but we see that €950 million should be the floor and. the analyst consensus on this year we don't think is too far off of what we can achieve.. And then, the dividend payment I should probably tell you a little bit on that as well. Of. course, we had a base dividend of €3.25 for the current year.. There's no particularly good reason that the very same goes according to plan that we. should not have the same base dividend for 2016. When it comes to special dividend, of. course, it will pretty much depend what happens throughout the year. If the market. continues to be soft because we have no volatility then of course the probability that we. will see a special dividend again is very high. If we have large volatility and, as a result,. significant opportunities to grow the business exponentially which of course is a less likely. scenario, then we may not pay a special dividend but rather use that money to produce. additional profits, the less likely scenario I have to say.. With that, briefly, why are we confident with the profitability of Hannover Re 2016 and. beyond? On the life & health business, we feel that the trend to increase profitability. where we see the base here in 2013 is fully intact even though 2015 significantly (57:34). trend line.. Secondly, on the P&C, we feel that we'll continue to have a quality portfolio. We feel that. as one of the top three reinsurer we are in a position that we have sought-after capacity. by our clients and the situation regarding the conservatism on the loss reserves and the. buffers in the loss reserves has actually further improved in 2015.. So, we are confident that we will continue to show acceptable underwriting profits also in. the coming years, again the provider on the large losses. Retrocession is the only area,. where the soft market really benefits us, so we bought a little bit more. We, still, on the. expected losses pay a margin (58:32) on our retrocession. We should make that clear in. case some of our retrocession fully comes in (58:38) don't worry, you are right.. On the investment income, our business continues to have positive cash flows. We feel. that our investment strategies that Roland explained in detail is valid, so we expect that. the absolute returns will continue to be at the level that we have seen in the past years in. absolute terms not narrative terms.. Lastly, as far as the admin expenses is concerned, actually, we managed to reduce our. admin expense ratio in 2015. That, of course, also had to do with the increased premium. With that, I would like to close off with our presentation, and Roland and I will be more. than happy to answer your questions. Thank you very much.. Operator. Well thank you. We will now begin with our question and answer session.. We proceed with the questions from the attendances in the room and switch then to the. questions coming from the conference call. I already see some questions here. First was. Andrew Ritchie.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Three quick questions. When I look at your – delve into. the Annual Report, there are three measures of capital. I think it's one ranging from 131%. coverage to 246%, there's 131% on your internal model, 246% one version Solvency II,. 221% another version Solvency II, it's not to (1:00:52) have a choice. Which one really. matters just remind us and if you have any kind of reasonable sort of target range around. which one should we look at, which one should we care about? That will be the first. question.. Second question, is there any measure of how much of your buffer has gone up on the. non-life reserves? When I look at the combined ratio and back out large losses, back out. prior year development, it hasn't changed much year-on-year, so I'm finding it hard to see. how there's a lot of additional conservatism the last peak, (1:01:25) maybe help me there.. And the third question, when I look in the Annual Report, it says that there's already a. small benefit, I think you used the language pro rata on lower collateral costs in the life. business. What is the benefit already, how much more benefit is there to come through in. 2016?. Karl Steinle. Yeah, would you like to (1:01:45)?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah, I have to. I can understand that the solvency numbers become a little bit more profit. (1:01:51) and you have different numbers. And the 131% is just internal model number. based on one in 3,333 years (1:02:04) the return period or ruin probability. That is only a. proxy for what we expect as an S&P rating because it's a AA quality.. If you look at the 246% and 221%, so 246% is the full internal model. And the 221% is the. internal model as it's approved by BaFin. Therefore, from legal (1:02:42) solvencies, the. 221% is the important number and that is also the number where we have a limit and. threshold in our risk management system where the limit is 180% and the threshold is. 200%. And the reason that we are so far away here from 100% is that we believe that we. are AA credit and limit and threshold should reflect that AA credit.. What is the difference between the 246% and the 221%? The main difference is that, on. our full model, we use our own model also for calculating the operational risk. However,. our operational risk model has not found the blessing of the BaFin, our regulator. So, in. Solvency II, relevant model for our legal solvency, we use our internal model for the. quantitative risk, and for the operational risk, we use the standard model.. The standard model comes out with higher number for operational risk than our internal. model. We are currently working and BaFin expects that from us to work on our internal. model for operational risk to get that approved as well. I think we are on a good path. there.. The other difference is that in our internal model the capital of the minority shareholders,. in particular, of ENS3 (1:04:25), we calculate them as available funds for 100%. Under. Solvency II rules and regulations, it's the haircut (1:04:33) on minorities. And this is the. other admittedly much smaller difference. That brings the 246% to the 221%, so that is. The second question.... Andrew J. Ritchie. I'm sorry to be a bit detailed (1:04:51) on this. The one I see 100% (1:04:52) is the sort of. softest (1:04:55) binding constraint that you had done (1:04:55)?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, yeah, I mean, on the legal solvency.... Andrew J. Ritchie. On legal measures (1:05:01).. Ulrich Wallin. ...the constraint would be based on the 221%. And I mean, it's a self-imposed constraint to. the extent that we have the limit and the threshold at 180% and 200%, respectively.. There is of course also a threshold on the S&P and A.M. Best models even though that. looks quite comfortable at this point in time.. Then you wonder how the confidence level could have gone up when you see that the. underlying combined ratio is presumably quite similar to what it was last year. First of all,. the absolute loss reserves have increased. So the contribution to our IBNR reserve what. we can segment with called (1:05:59) segment reserves is significantly higher this year. than it was last year. This year, I think it was, from memory, 236 million (1:06:08).. And also, the development of the past losses in 2015 was very favorable. Therefore, if. you look at the calculation at the end of 2014, of course, it had an expectation for the paid. losses and the advice losses in 2015 and the actual paid and advised in 2015 were below. the expectation at the end of 2014. Therefore, in the extrapolation of the triangulations. into the future, that way we saw increased redundancies. That is the reason.. So loss reserves in absolute terms increased and actual loss emergence in 2015, below. what we expected in the actual calculation at the end of 2014, that's the reason for that.. And then the last question I would hand over to Roland, I guess. That is on the percentage. of the collateral costs that we already saved in the current year compared to what we. save next year.. Roland Vogel. What we are referring to here is a larger transaction which we have implemented late. third quarter last year, which should save us a little bit more than €20 million per year, and. insofar, we have a pro rata benefit from that. This one transaction, I already before that. we were also able to decrease the overall volume and that we were able to decrease the. cost of the LOC capacity which we use. In that regard, there should be a – but this is. something I cannot quantify right now. It will also benefit us next year, so I think the first. step here should be something between €5 million and €10 million in absolute terms.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. And then, of course, there was one other transaction that we closed at the end of. last year which would also reduce the collateral costs by about €6 million per year. So, if. you look at it all in all, saved collateral costs for 2016 should be around 34 million. Of that,. what we had already achieved in last year in 2015 would be around €6 million.. Operator. Hey, well, the next question comes from Frank Kopfinger.. Frank Kopfinger. It's Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. I would also like to come back to the Solvency II. number, to the 221%. Unfortunately, you only provided as of the end of September within. your Annual Report. Can you then provide some sort of guidance there? Are we – as of. the end of 2015 and maybe also as of today as we had some volatility also in credit. spreads last (1:09:39) recently?. And secondly, my question would be on negative interest rates. Do you have a number. that you can share? How much of your – or what's the share of your portfolio of assets. that are affected already by negative interest rates? And more important, what do you. see as an consequence for you as an investor? Are you going to lengthen the duration to. avoid negative interest rates? Are you climbing up the risk curve or what is your strategy?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I would leave the question on negative interest rates to Roland because far too. complicated for me. But on the Solvency II number, yes, it's a number at the end of the. third quarter that is in the Annual Report. And the reason for that is that the full calculation. of the economic balance sheet, but of course, the basis for that which is a Pillar 3 of. Solvency II efforts that we are doing this year is still a little bit late, but that will change in. future.. I would say that we already calculated the capital required and that has stayed stable from. the third quarter to year-end. The funds available, so we expect those that they will be. increasing to some extent because if you look at IFRS capital, it has increased by around. €400 million from the third quarter to year-end. That increase of course will also flow. through to the economic balance sheet. Then of course we have developments of the. embedded value and the redundant loss reserves which also play a role there.. I would say, on average, that should be rather neutral. So I expect that, at the end of the. fourth quarter, the Solvency II ratio is actually increasing, but we will let you know the exact. number in due course. What we've seen so far in 2016, that's a bit early to say. I mean, I. think we have seen some further widening of spread that will, of course, I mean, reduce. the valuation reserves, but there are of course other movements as well. I mean, there is. some new business being written on the Life business so far. And I mean the quarter is. not over yet. I mean, losses have been rather benign I mean around the world.. So we have to see what that does, but we will certainly bit by bit, I mean, improve the. speed of our reporting here because, from 2017 onwards, we have to report quarterly on. our economic balance sheet and the deadlines are getting closer and closer as well. We. are in the process of using our accounting system that we also use to come up with the. HDB and (1:13:10) IFRS numbers also for the Solvency reporting. That is not an easy task. and it's not per se (1:13:14) a simple project, but it would allow us to more efficiently come. up with those numbers and also more reliable.. Roland Vogel. If I may add, I think we are fully aware that Solvency II is on everybody's minds, but on the. other hand, we've never been reporting about Solvency II numbers because we really. didn't have a real restriction here. We do follow this model far more closely. It is based on. our internal model where we also build decisions on so on, so forth, it is far more. important that we should bear in mind it is not a real restriction in our strategies today. We. are fully aware that other companies in the insurance world are far more restricted for. those it might be far more important. But for us right now, it is another hurdle we have to. jump over. This is also why you don't see it as so pronounced and with a lot of focus in our. presentation.. Ulrich Wallin. (1:14:29). Roland Vogel. Yes, I have the negative interests or the negative things for me here. I don't have the. exact number with me how much of my portfolio bears negative interest rates. I think we. can do the math a little bit together. We are talking about, if that is a euro government. problem, then we have approximately 30% of – 31% in the euro right now, we have 26% in. (1:15:01). If that is approximately the way where we are, we might be a little bit more in the. euro here. So we're talking perhaps a 10% potential where this dependent on the maturity. in the country I'm investing in, this might be the case.. Your question was as to whether this really affects our investment strategy, and the. answer to that is no. We have to invest. We have monies and sometimes we have to. invest monies and also euros short term safely. And we will also have securities in our. portfolio which do bear negative interest. The important thing for me is the risk appetite. and the reinvestment yields that we always publish the reinvestment yields. They have. been below on a theoretic basis. So if I invest everything exactly how I have invested. today, that was between 1.7, 1.8 (1:16:07) over the last years, in fact, I have a math (1:16:10). with me now because we do not exactly reinvest where we are and had been invested. few years ago that the achievements for last year was above 2 (1:16:23).. In that regard, that is the important thing to me where the whole strategy ends up. So. also your suggestion that we might increase maturities would not be, from my point of. view, an advisable strategy. If the marginal spread I can make is better on a long-term. corporate part (1:16:50), than I would rather accept negative interest rates in a. government bond. And the higher marginal spread on a long-term corporate or vice. versa. This has to be decided. We look at the options which we have and that includes. also most naturally – securities was negative, spreads and to increase maturity for the. portfolio as such is not a solution. Anyway, you know that we match currencies and we. match maturities rather dogmatically.. Operator. Okay. Well then I have another question from Stefan Scharff.. Stef an Scharff. Yes, Stefan Scharff, SRC Research. One quick question about your guidance. It's about the. premium volume more or less unchanged, and I would assume after the good picture in. Life & Health business in 2015 that this good picture will continue in 2016 and also the. premium volume in Life & Health should increase at least a little bit. That would mean that. in the non-life business, you expect a slightly decreasing volume of premiums. Is this a. good assumption from my side?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. We expect slight decrease in premiums on non-life at this point in time. We made. the calculation after the one, one (1:18:23) renewal season and looked – made an. assumption what will happen on the midyear renewals, looked at the unearned premium. from previous years coming in. And so we came to the conclusion that we would be. around 2% to 2.5% below what we had last year based on unchanged exchange rates. Of. course, the exchange rate can bring things a little bit in out of order, I would say.. If I look at the Life & Health, I mean, we have a number of large fees which are. discontinued which we have to make up for. I mean, I think that we might end up similar,. maybe slightly up, maybe slightly down. That's not so important for me. The most. important thing is the bottom line on the Life & Health. Because if I write deposit. accounted treaties, I'm equally happy with the profits then if they come with a lot of. premium. That is less of an issue as far as I am concerned, at least for the current year.. Important is that we increase the value of new business and that we increase the. underlying profitability.. We have a lot of growth initiatives, so I'm fully expecting that, in the medium term, also. the premium volume on our Life & Health business will continue to grow. I mean, one thing. on the Life & Health which I would like to remind you is that it's not a terribly large. business. I mean, Life & Health reinsurance is only about 50 billion of worldwide premium. volume, and it's very concentrated. I mean, the top seven reinsurers have about 97% of. those 50 billion. So where we grow we have to create new business which up to now has. not been reinsured.. Stef an Scharff. One quick follow-up question about the EBIT margin and mortality and morbidity business.. As we can on see on slide 18, you achieved 3.6% in 2015 and the target is to come near. to 6%. What is your assumption for the current year?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I would be disappointed if we are again below 6%. I mean, 6% is what we need to. get and our colleagues are working on it.. Operator. Okay. Well, the next question is coming from Mr. Schäfer.. Andreas Schäf er. Andreas Schäfer, Bankhaus Lampe. Just one question on your guidance with respect to. the investment income. I mean, you're targeting more or less a stable investment income,. but your target yield is some 50 basis points below what you have achieved in the last. year. So how does it fit together? I can't believe that your assets under management will. grow some 15% this year.. Roland Vogel. I think what we mentioned is that we will keep the volumes – or that we will keep the net. investment income stable with regard to the expectations. We had an expectation for. 2015 of approximately 3%. We have some extraordinaries up and down. We have – that. also includes a negative ModCo, we didn't embark on that too much.. So what we usually said is that we should be able to mitigate the 15 basis points which – or. around 15 basis points ROI which I lose approximately year-by-year by increased volumes.. I think that is the assumption behind the plan right now. The plan right now does not. include realizations to a large extent or to an extent where – which we had seen over the. last two years. This is how you – this, of course, includes no currency exchange effects in it.. So, right now, it might not – the plan today is obviously a little bit lower than what we have. achieved in 2015. But this still leaves us the room up – but it's a more or less theoretical. bottom approach. You look at the maturities you have at your current portfolio, then the. majorities, that is assumption of positive cash flows. We do apply our re-investment yields.. Now a little bit better than we had calculated and that comes up then with an investment. gain which, right now, in the plan as it is set up early this year is a little bit lower than what. we have achieved last year.. Ulrich Wallin. But, of course, it also helps us that we have increased our investment in U.S. dollars and. reduced our investments in euro. U.S. dollars, you get higher interest rates, and we did. that of course by converting the functional currency of our RS (1:24:04) subsidiary from. euros to U.S. dollars. We did that not in order to earn higher investment income, but. largely in order to help our subsidiary with their capital requirements which are almost. exclusively in U.S dollar and on a group basis to mirror the currencies of our capital that. seek currencies of our capital requirement.. Operator. Okay. Well, the next question comes from Roland Pfänder.. Roland Pf änder. Roland Pfänder, ODDO BANK (1:24:43). Coming back to your Life business, could you. please provide us an EBIT split regarding financial solutions, longevity, morbidity and. mortality? And maybe you could have some words on the financial solutions business.. Why is it this profitable? Is there not competition coming in and normalizing the margins,. so to say, or what's your take on this? Maybe you have a hard number on your reserve. redundancies. How much did they go up in 2015? Thank you?. Ulrich Wallin. Firstly, regards (1:25:18) to the financial solutions business so profitable. I mean, the. profitable part of that is largely business that we have started to generate following the. financial crisis. And it revolves around redundant reserves of so-called Triple-X and AXXX. reserves in the States which up until then largely had to be financed by LOCs. Then in. 2008, the LOC costs increased dramatically. We offered structures to our clients that they. could deal with those statutory capital requirement without the use of LOCs but without –. with the use of other structures.. That business has the average duration of those facilities is like 10 years and it has. relatively high margins at that time. All of those transactions have to be approved by the. regulators and the respective states and what is most important and we have seen that in. recent survey for the clients there is a deal (1:26:46) of certainty. As we have done some. (1:26:52) largest number of deals, it helps us to acquire new ones because we can offer. better deal with certainty. It's fair to say that on a like-for-like basis, the margins on that. business have come down. But as the business is covering redundant reserve, the. expected loss ratio on it is actually zero, because they are far out of the money stop. losses basically, that's what in essence is. (1:27:16) That creates a profitability. The other. part of that business, as I explained, is cash financing.. Profit margins, I mean, EBIT margins on cash finance are not that attractive, but in a mix, I. mean, the profit margin comes up pretty high. Of course, in 2015, it was aided by one-off. effect that we generated profits particularly with that one transaction that was mentioned,. which otherwise we would (1:27:52) have received. In the coming years, we front-loaded. them upwards, but the underlying business is still growing, that's a good thing. We. continue to have new transactions on that side, both financing as well as these, I mean,. financing of redundant reserves.. Then the split, I mean, if you split the longevity where we have 4.5% margin, and then that. leaves 18.1% for financial solutions, that is a little bit inflated on the longevity business. because there was one transaction which was over-reserved last year out of a actuarial. arrow. That arrow had to be corrected this year, and that created some €20 million. additional earnings on that business.. Overall, our reserving on longevity business is conservative because, I mean, you have of. course locked in assumptions as you have on Life & Health. On longevity, we impair them. on a by treaty basis. So if you have actually to expect it, that is positive and we have. better view on the mortality for the future. We will not unlock, we are not allowed to. unlock, and so the reserves they remain unchanged. If we have a negative deviation on. our future expectations, we unlock and book that has a loss. We had part of that in 2015. admittedly smaller numbers, single-digit numbers because it was smaller transaction, but. that's how we look at that.. The split between mortality and morbidity, Roland has right in front of him.. Roland Vogel. Positive. Mortality written margin was 4.1% and the morbidity was 2.3%. And I think you. were also referring to the absolute number of reserve redundancy increases. We are still. waiting for the final reports to come in, this is why it is always a bit difficult, but my CEO",20160310_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2016-3-10_FS000000002259507768.pdf,2016-03-10
6,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re international. conference call on the Q3 2020 results. For your information, this conference is being. recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand you over to our host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques Henchoz,. Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Let me welcome you to this. conference call presenting our results for the first nine months of the year. As usual, I'll. start with an overview before our new Group CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel goes through. the financials in detail. And I will then comment on the outlook for the year later on. For the. Q&A, I'm additionally joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller, on the life side; and. Sven Althoff for P&C.. Looking at the results for the first nine months. The Hannover Re Group has again proven. its resilience, bearing in mind that we have absorbed a total pre-tax impact of around. EUR860 million from COVID-19 in our P&C and Life & Health business segment, the group. net income of EUR668 million and the return on equity of 8.3% are quite satisfactory.. Additionally, the Solvency II ratio of 222% remains comfortably above our 200% threshold.. And with double-digit premium growth our new business production is fully intact in an. improving market environment. Overall, there is of course still an element of uncertainty. around the COVID-19 loss experience going forward. However, due to the provisions. made for expected COVID-19 related losses, we're now in a position to provide guidance. for the year-end results. As things currently stand, Hannover Re anticipates a group net. income of more than EUR800 million for the full year 2020.. Going into the details of the results of our P&C reinsurance business. The additional. EUR100 million related to COVID-19 claims in the third quarter are significantly lower than. what we booked in Q1 and Q2, bringing the total loss estimate to EUR700 million. The. major part 71% of the EUR700 million are still IBNR reserves. And the affected lines of. business are also largely the same as before, namely business interruption, credit and. surety and event cancellations.. Additionally, we have reserved for expected losses in some other lines as for instance. D&O. The COVID-19 losses, together with a NatCat and man-made large losses where. we observed increased activity in the third quarter, exceeded our budget for the first nine. months by EUR400 million, bringing the year-to-date combined ratio to 101.4%.. In life and health reinsurance, the COVID-19 impact on the result was EUR160 million. The. main driver here is our US business. Against this backdrop, the EBIT of EUR315 million is. strong, also stripping out a positive one-off effect of EUR55 million within the investment. income. Financial solutions continues to perform superbly. And the US mortality. experience excluding the COVID-19 effect was in line with our expectations.. Finally, at 2.8% or 2.7% adjusted for the one-off effect in life and health, the return on. investment is satisfactory and in line with our initial and now reconfirmed new target for. 2020. The profitable premium growth in the first nine months is the main reason for the. very positive operating cash flow of EUR2.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2020,. which is already higher than full year figures for the previous year.. The strong cash flow in turn is fueling the growth in assets under management shown on. the right side of the slide, which is particularly important in the current low yield. environment, because the growing asset base is helping us to mitigate the impact from. low reinvestment yields.. Looking at the details of the invested assets. The positive change in valuation reserves. only partly offset the negative effects from currency translation resulting from the. devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Altogether, assets under own management stood at about. EUR49 billion at the end of the third quarter.. Looking at our capital position. Shareholders' equity increased by 2.8%. As you can see,. the net income for the first nine months was sufficient to fully cover the dividend payment. in Q2, which is even more pleasing, bearing in mind that the group absorbed a negative. net COVID-19 impact of EUR860 million.. Within the OCI, the positive impact from the decrease in interest rates is more than. compensating for negative effects from currency translation. On the left side of the slide,. you can see that the capital composition is more or less unchanged. You might remember. that we issued EUR500 million in hybrid capital in July. However, we also had a EUR500. million hybrid bonds with the first call date in September. And as we exercise the call. option as planned, there is no visible effect on the total hybrid position. By the way, the. same is also true of our Solvency II balance sheet, which means that we have also. maintained a high degree of flexibility around our hybrid capacity.. On that note, I would like to hand over to Clemens, our CFO who will explain the figures. in more detail.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Good morning, and thank you, Jean-Jacques. It's a pleasure for me to present the. financials of the Hannover Re Group for the first time. So moving directly on to the. segmental reporting.. I will start with the development of our property and casualty business group on Slide 7.. Gross written premium grew by 16% adjusted for currency effects. The growth is highly. diversified, which is pleasing with particularly strong contributions from North America and. the APAC region. Overall the development was driven more by property than casualty. business.. Looking at the large loss situation for Hannover Re. The loss activity from natural. catastrophes and man-made losses has clearly increased significantly compared to the. first half year, almost exhausting the Q3 standalone budget of EUR336 million. On the. other hand, the additional net impact from COVID-19 at EUR100 million was materially. below the numbers we saw in Q1 or Q2. Overall, 71% of the estimated EUR700 million of. total impact still consist of IBNR reserves.. As Jean-Jacques explained, there remains of course an elevated level of uncertainty. around the further loss experience. However, the high level of IBNR also provides. significant headroom for actual claims to be reported and we do feel comfortable with. our reserving position as of today.. As a result of the reserving for COVID-19-related claims expectations, the large loss. budget for the first nine months of 2020 was exceeded by EUR400 million, accounting. for roughly 3.8 combined ratio points. Adjusting the reported combined ratio of 101.4 for. this budget over run, the figure would have been close to our 97% target for 2020.. In terms of the runoff of our reserves, it's fair to say that in the nine-months 2020, our. runoff result was positive and overall in line with our expectation. Altogether, I would. guess the confidence level should not have changed materially since year-end 2019. But I. would at least not assume that we added anything to our reserve buffer.. On the investment side, net investment income decreased by around EUR100 million with. lower contributions mainly from private equity, from real estate and from our inflationlinked bonds within the ordinary return. Compared to the second quarter, impairments. were modest in the third quarter and on a nine-month basis offset by an increase in. realized gains. Other income and expenses were positive by EUR67 million mainly driven. by positive currency effects. Altogether, the EBIT margin decreased to 5.6%, mainly due. to the weaker underwriting result.. On Slide 8, total net large losses including COVID-19-related claims accounted for. EUR1.149 million in the first nine months of 2020, exceeding the budget of EUR749 million. by EUR400 million. Compared to the first half year, the difference between the gross and. net loss, as you can see on the slide has increased. This is because the high NatCat. activity in Q3 triggered our retro program. And additionally, a part of our COVID losses. are covered by our retro as well.. Overall, the EUR1.14 billion net loss already exceeds our full year budget by EUR175 million.. This means that 2020 will be the fourth consecutive year with large losses above the. expectation, which of course is not only true for Hannover Re, but it also applies to the. industry as a whole. And that should trigger even more positive pricing moments going. forward.. On Slide 9, you can see our large loss list. It reflects the increased loss activity as. mentioned earlier in the third quarter. Largest loss on the NatCat side, as you can see. here, what's the so-called (the record) storm event in the US, followed by Hurricane Laura.. On the man-made side, the port explosion in Beirut accounted for EUR67 million on a net. basis. Due to the very benign first half year, total large losses would still have been below. budget excluding COVID-19. Looking at the numbers for COVID-19. In Q3, the gross loss. increased by EUR264 million to EUR873 million.. In comparison, the net development of EUR100 million was significantly lower. The reason. for this is that we receive more and more information from our clients enabling us to. allocate IBNR reserves to individual treaties. And we also take into consideration, of. course, our retrocession protection. This was not possible with the IBNR booked in the. first half year.. You will remember that where we had reported a gros loss very close to the net, even. though the underlying assumption for the gross loss was already higher. In the event of. further increases in the gross position, it's fair to say in the fourth quarter, we can at least. partly expect corresponding relief from our retrocessions, which will then limit the impact. of course on our net position.. On Slide 10, that shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business. Overall,. COVID-19 affected several regions and lines of business, as you can see here. But Europe. and credit and surety were the most severely impacted ones. The weaker technical. profitability in the Americas was mainly the result of the mentioned weather-related U.S.. losses in the third quarter. Agricultural business was mainly affected by the Bushfires in. Australia and some COVID effects.. On the positive side, the technical profitability of our facultative business as well as our. aviation and marine business was very favorable. Altogether, combined ratio was at 101.4.. On Slide 12, looking at the development of our life and health business group. Growth was. mainly driven by a large financing treaty. You will remember that probably from last year. from earlier calls that we wrote in Q4 2019 in Australia. However, this was partly mitigated. by the expected reduction in premium volume due to the effect of recaptures in our U.S.. mortality portfolio, as a result of our management actions in the previous year.. Altogether, gross written premium in life and health increased by 5% adjusted for. currency effects. The impact from COVID-19 was EUR160 million in the first nine months,. of which 43% is booked as IBNR. The main driver was our US mortality book. But other. areas, like for example our Australian disability business are also affected.. Overall, we are still seeing significant differences between population mortality and the. effect on our portfolio, largely due to socioeconomic factors and a age structure. Apart. from COVID-19, the result of our life and health business group was quite favorable. The. legacy US mortality portfolio performed in line with our expectation. And the earnings. contribution from our financial solutions business in particular, continued to be excellent.. On top of this, we recorded an extraordinary gain of EUR55 million from an equity. participation as part of our investment income. Adjusting for both the EUR160 million. COVID-19 impact and this positive one-off, the EBIT would have been very favorable at. around EUR420 million.. Looking at the individual third quarter. The normalized EBIT on the life and health side. would have been EUR143 million. The net investment income decreased mainly due to the. EUR100 million positive one-off effect recorded in 2019. You will remember that which was. only partly offset by the one-off effect in this year. Otherwise, the ordinary income was. favorably supported by an overall positive contribution from the change in fair value. through P&L, even though the impact from our ModCo derivative was negative by EUR9. million.. Other income and expenses primarily driven by further increase in the contributions from. our deposit accounted financial solutions business. Currency effects were slightly. negative. At 5.3%, the tax ratio is low, mainly due to good results from subsidiaries in. jurisdictions with a low tax rate and the tax reduced investment gains from the. aforementioned participation. In the third quarter standalone, we have seen the same. effects and in combination with losses at individual subsidiaries. The tax rate was even. negative.. On Slide 13, sort of as an additional information beyond the IFRS numbers. This slide. shows an overview of the new business written in the third quarter 2020 as well as. upcoming business opportunity on the life and health side. Both the new business and the. pipeline business are rather diversified by region and reporting category, but particularly. our financial solution business is an area where we continue to see very healthy demand.. Just for the sake of completeness, since we've focused only on the most important deals. here in this overview. This, of course, does not mean that we don't see any opportunities. in markets or regions, not mentioned on this slide. Altogether, the value of new business. achieved in the first nine months already comfortably surpasses our full year target of at. least EUR220 million.. So moving on to our investments on Slide 15. I think it's pleasing to see that despite the. very challenging market environment on the capital markets, the return on investments of. 2.8%, including ModCo and excluding ModCo actually, it's -- so the aforementioned. amount doesn't really contribute to that number. So 2.8% return on investment is still in. line with our initial full year target, even excluding the EUR55 million positive one-off effect. in life and health that I mentioned earlier, the ROI would still have been 2.7%.. The decrease in ordinary investment income is driven on the one hand by lower. contribution from our inflation-linked bond portfolio. You know that we purchased that to. hedge our inflation risk. And there is some balancing effect, of course, on the underwriting. side as well. On the other hand, by the returns from private equity, which were also. weaker compared to our expectation in a normal market environment and compared to. the very high contributions in the last -- particularly the last two years.. Realized gains are on a similar level to last year, where we have benefited from the. restructuring of our participation in Viridium. This year, realizations are mainly coming from. our fixed income portfolio. And impairments and depreciations were higher than last year,. mainly due to the impairments for alternative investments in the second quarter.. Impairments recognized in the third quarter were fair to say very moderate. Unrealized. gains increased remarkably to EUR3.2 billion, driven by significantly lower interest rates. and further normalization of credit spreads due to the recovery of corporate bond. markets.. On the next slide, Slide 16, you can see that we have actually not changed too much in our. asset allocation. I think the slide is quite familiar to most of you. So we have not changed. the asset allocation and we do not intend to do so. You might remember, even before. the crisis started, we had begun to sort of scale back some of the proportion of bonds. attributable to our US SME portfolio. And we have used the price correction in the stock. market in March to carefully reenter the listed equities, buying around EUR250 million.. As mentioned in earlier quarterly results calls, we have been following a passive derisking. approach with new money being invested in high quality assets only. However, in the. meantime, this has come to an end. And we do carefully start back to normalize our credit. risk taking. Contribution, as you can see here, on the ordinary investment income is. diversified as usual, this time with a slightly lower share from private equity.. So this conclude my remarks. And I hand back to you Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, Clemens. Let me now cover the outlook section on Slide 18. And. first, our updated guidance for 2020. Based on our assessment of the impact of the. COVID-19 pandemic, we feel comfortable enough to provide guidance on our financial. results again, and expect group net income of more than EUR800 million for 2020.. You might ask why the Q4 performance needed to achieve. The EUR800 million looks. modest. But as you already heard, some negative effects are to be expected in life and. health as in previous quarters. And additionally, the investment return in our assumptions. is slightly lower than the 2.8% for the first nine months. For the full year, it should still be. around 2.7%.. Gross written premium for the group is expected to show high single-digit percentage. growth at constant exchange rates. Finally, we expect to pay an ordinary dividend of EUR4. per share for the year 2020, in line with the previous year. The payout of a special. dividend will be partially dependent on the growth opportunities that actually materialize. in the upcoming P&C renewals in January and the amount of capital tied up by this growth.. Based on increasing demand for reinsurance and improving market conditions, it is. pleasing to see that many lines of business are growing. Even more importantly, we also. expect these trends to continue in the next renewal seasons for 2021. The profitability. outlook for the full year 2020 is more or less in line with the combined ratio overview. Clemens showed earlier, largely reflecting the COVID-19 impact.. In life and health, we can similarly see which lines of business are affected by the. pandemic, namely mortality and morbidity. On the positive side, as already stated, our. currently most important profit driver financial solutions continues to perform very well.. And the profitability of our longevity business is also strong.. Even if hardening market cycles are generally not a theme in life and health reinsurance,. we have seen earlier that our new business production is fully impact -- fully intact, sorry,. and that the pipeline looks quite healthy. Demand in financial solutions continues to be. favorable and is also visible this time in our premium development, due in particular to a. large financing deal in Australia. Additionally, we see promising growth potential in the. Asian market. And the growth of our mortality business is impacted by the effect of. recaptures in our U.S. mortality portfolio.. As usual, we also provide a first look at our expectations for the next financial year. together with the publication of our Q3 numbers, even though the market environment is. currently more dynamic than usual.. Gross written premium is expected to grow by around 5%. And you might be surprised. that the number is not higher in light of a hardening P&C market. But firstly, we didn't want. to put too much pressure on our underwriters by giving a higher volume target. As usual,. the focus is on the bottom line contribution. And secondly, I would point to the potential. negative impact the economic downturn might have on the primary insurance market and. indirectly also possibly on proportional reinsurance business.. Of course, it's early days and we will review this target after the one-one renewals when. we have more transparency on their outcome. The return on investment is impacted by. the lower reinvestment yields. And additionally, we expect some lower contributions from. inflation-linked bonds with the resulting decline to 2.4% in the next year. Regarding the. inflation-linked bonds, please bear in mind that we buy those to hedge the inflation risk of. our P&C reserves. And therefore economically, there is an offset in our liabilities.. On the positive side, assets under management are expected to grow further due to the. positive cash flow helping to mitigate the impact on the absolute investment income.. Altogether, we anticipate group net income in the range of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25. billion, and therefore, on a similar level to the initial expectation for this year.. Looking at the components of this guidance. The contribution from our P&C business. should improve compared to our assumptions for the last year, whereas the investment. return is slightly under pressure in the low yield environment. The development of life and. health is expected to be more stable. In general, there is, of course, a higher degree of. uncertainty than usual. And various factors such as the availability of COVID-19 vaccines will. have an influence on the further course of the pandemic.. Therefore our guidance is subject to the premise that we do not see a significant COVID19 impact on our life and health business, and as usual, that major loss expenditure. remains within the budgeted level and that there are no unforeseen distortions on capital. markets. The large loss budget for the next year will be increased to EUR1.1 billion, largely. driven by the growth of our business.. Finally, we will continue to adhere to our general dividend policy going forward, with a. payout ratio of 35% to 45% for the ordinary dividend and the addition of a special. dividend, if our performance is in line with expectations and the capitalization of the. company remains comfortable.. This concludes our remarks, and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Question And Answer). We will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first. question is from Emanuele Musio, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now. open.. Emanuele Musio. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have two questions. Looking at. your guidance for 2021, I am quite surprised that you are aiming at earnings in line with. 2019, basically. However, since then, the rate have gradually improved. The momentum. will start quite strongly in 2020, partly as a consequence of lower investment returns that. you mentioned already, right? And so, was just curious to know a bit more about your. assumption for 2021 maybe in terms of COVID-19 and loss expectation? Or maybe you. are implying that rate improvements are still not enough? Or maybe you are just setting. the bar low in view of uncertainties and maybe the idea is to gradually raise the bar as. clarity emerge? Any comment of this would be much appreciated.. And the second one is still on objectives. I mean it is, I think broadly shared view that 2021. will see further pricing improvements, although the improvement will learn through full in. 2022. So as far as gross written premium growth in 2021 is concerned, you aim at just 5%.. So I struggle to understand because it might be argued that lower top-line growth in a. hardening market should go to the benefit of profitability, but this is not reflected in your. net income guidance.. So what is the missing link here? You said, you don't want to put pressure on underwriters,. but arguably rates have gone up by more than 5%. So even if you renew your existing. book at better rates, shouldn't you see more than that, more than 5%? I mean, what is. the average rate improvement across your book to-date? So if you can please help me. understand a little bit more about these two elements.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much. So maybe just a couple of general comments, and I'll pass on to my. colleagues just to go into the specifics.. I think we're faced with a situation, which of course, is rather uncertain. And it's much. harder this year to anticipate the development in '21. So the range is a little bit -- the. range of outcome is a bit wider. But nevertheless, we felt sufficiently confident to affirm. range in terms of net income and growth. I think in terms of growth, the biggest challenge. we're facing is the uncertainty on the economic outlook. So this is very hard to quantify.. And we felt this would of course have a bearing on the eventual growth outlook therefore. 5%, which might come a bit more modest than anticipated.. So maybe both P&C and life and health, I'll ask Sven to start with P&C with the. assumptions, expectations for '21 and then Klaus on the life and health outlook.. Sven Althoff. Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques.. When it comes to the profitability, our expectation is that we will have substantial rate. increases at set to 1:1 and later renewals. But as I already explained during our Investors. Day, this will not directly translate 1:1 into an improved combined ratio. It will to some. degree, but the features, which will eat part of the rate increase, which will be achieved as. -- losses go into our models. And therefore, our view on risk for some classes of risk lines. of business have increased, requiring part of the rate increases we will achieve.. And secondly, as you know, we are buying significant amount of retrocessional coverage.. Whilst we are confident that we will achieve pricing, which is risk-adjusted similar to the. pricing we have in 2020, the underlying business has grown as you can see looking at our. Q3 premium figures. So therefore the premium for those covers will increase in line with. exposure growth also eating part of our gross rate increases that we are going to. achieve.. On the growth side, in addition to what Jean-Jacques has already explained, I can offer. two additional comments. One is that rate increases does not necessarily always translate. into premium increases. There are lines of business, which are driven by turnover or other. classes of business, which have a link to the underlying pricing of, for example, the. commodity. And in a situation of a severe economic downturn, therefore the underlying. premium or exposure basis is somewhat erod. D and therefore rate increases do not. necessarily mean premium increases on a one-to-one basis. And secondly, you know that. the business is not only re-rated at the reinsurance level, but also at the insurance level.. So therefore, for certain covers, the confidence of our ceding companies will be. increased so they may retain a little more of the business net.. And secondly, the re-rating of the reinsurance may lead to restructuring of programs also. meaning that ceding companies may take higher net positions at the more frequency part. of their programs. So that would be my explanations on the P&C side.. Klaus Miller. Okay. On the life side, we basically have to look at the U.S. and the performance there.. The claims Jean-Jacques mentioned the EUR160 million are more than two-thirds from. the U.S. And I would expect that to be the case also next year. All the other countries do. not contribute significantly to any COVID claims so far. And in the U.S., we have certainly. an expectation that for Q1, Q2 in 2021, we will still see losses of the same magnitude as. we have seen in the last two quarters. This might and probably will be compensated to a. large extent by new business. We see a huge demand on financial solutions side.. And if you look at the Page 13 of the presentation, where you see the value of new. business and you just do a simple calculation, you probably have to use your ruler to. figure out the value of your business, because we didn't put the number on the page. But. it's about EUR 380 million. And if you deduct the EUR 160 million COVID claims, then you. end up exactly with the planned value of new business. So on the lifestyle, it looks like we. are fulfilling our plans completely and this should continue and might be evne more. favorable in 2021. But we will definitely see COVID claims. It all depends on the fact when. the U.S. starts managing the pandemic.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Maybe just one last piece of information on '21. Overall, we have the 5% growth. This is a. bit of a mixed bag. The P&C growth is expected to be beyond that while life and health. will be slightly below in the short term. So this shows a little bit of differentiation with the. hardening market reflected in the numbers and the importance of financial solutions in life. and health, which doesn't have such a strong impact on top line.. Emanuele Musio. Operator. Our next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now. open.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Good morning, everyone. First question is based on the dividend, how to think about. that? I guess the regular parts of the dividend is very clear. So a discussion there. But what. are the key trigger points to think about on capital position versus the special cost of the. dividend or one that you have paid in recent years. Is this S&P capital-linked? Or was there. some other trigger? And if you were to hit your plan that you have at the moment for the. renewals, given it sounds like you're being relatively conservative on kind of what you're. assuming there. Does that mean you've got enough capital to pay that special part of the. dividend or not? And the second question is looking at next year, your cat budget's. increased, I think, 13% year-on-year well ahead of the premium growth you're suggesting.. Is this mix change at some assumption change or bits of both? Any thoughts on that. would be helpful. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. Clemens will respond on the dividend and capital management and Sven on. that net cat.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you. Well, Kamran, on the dividend. Well, you can see that in our Solvency II. number, which is very stable at 222% as of Q3. So in all regimes and of course as you. rightly mentioned, we do have the rating agency models, et cetera. We've always had. good buffers both -- in both regimes, I would say. And we do, at the moment still have. sufficient water under the keel in terms of our capitalization.. However, I think it's fair to say that -- and you've seen that in 2020, our business has. grown at a stronger pace than our capital in all regimes. And if the opportunities appear. as we do expect them, particularly on the P&C side, they will absorb further capital. And. mean we really want to be in the best possible position to take full advantage of the. improving market conditions. So we really do not want to limit attractive growth. of the year, our Q4 position. But that's the reason why we have been careful in wording. we see the Q4 numbers and when we are through the renewals particularly on the P&C. Klaus Miller. As regard to your question on the major loss budget, could you please repeat your. question? I didn't fully understand parts of your question.. Kamran Hossain. Yes. Sure. The -- I guess, the large loss budget seems to have grown -- or for next year. seems to have grown 13%. You're implying 13 -- sorry, 13% versus 5% premium growth. So. I was just trying to understand is this a mix change in business? Or are you rising kind of. more cat business? Or is this an assumption change given the last four years have been. running ahead of budget, I guess, not just for you, but for the industry as well?. Klaus Miller. Okay. Thank you very much. The answer to that question is that it's a mix between our. over achievement in 2020. As you know, when we started the year, we didn't expect a. double-digit premium growth on the P&C side. And of course the EUR975 million, we had. written down in 2019 already. So therefore, a part of the adjustment is growth related in. 2020. And the second part, of course, is then growth related as an expectation into 2021.. When it comes to mix of business, we are not expecting any fundamental changes as far. as the mix of business is concerned. But what can be said is that we have made a little. more room in our internal model for writing natural catastrophe-exposed business given. the re-rating we are expecting. So we have adjusted our risk appetite from somewhere in. the 16% range to 18% of economic capital according to Solvency II. So there is a little. higher risk appetite, but not substantially.. That's great. Thank you.. Operator. Our next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead sir. Your line is. now open.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I hope you can hear me.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yep.. Vinit Malhotra. So the question -- the first one is on the gross loss on COVID in third quarter of EUR264. million. I just wanted to better understand is the allocation to the IBNRs and is the. allocation to the individual treaties, is that something that is just the mechanical. procedure? Or is that being actively driven in other words? And also is this gross-to-net. already in 3Q a bit faster than we expected -- or you expected? And just some. commentary on that would be interesting.. And second thing is just on the life mortality, the recent headline figures in the U.S. Is the. population and the portfolio, the difference -- I think in an earlier call, Klaus, you might. have mentioned, 20% population and 5% for Hannover's own book. Is the recent -- more. recent trend still in line with the earlier kind of relationship? Or is it that there is a bit of. more divergence between the population and what you would expect from Hannover Re. portfolio. And I'm more referring to even a qualitative comment from the more recent. data, not just 3Q, please. Thank you very much.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So the gross-to-net situation COVID will be answered by Sven and U.S.. mortality by Klaus.. Sven Althoff. Yes. For the P&C COVID side, we had seen more loss reserves advised by our ceding. companies in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The IBNR setting is not a. mechanical exercise. It's to a large degree a management decision. But as Jean-Jacques. mentioned, we have kept the overall level of IBNR at 71%, still relatively close to the 80%. we were showing in the second quarter. So it was important for us given the ongoing. uncertainty to keep the IBNR level at a relatively similar level compared to the second. quarter.. Given that we have a little more clarity, talking to our ceding companies from where we. can expect those losses, it was easier for us in the third quarter to book some of the IBNR. against individual contracts. And to the extent we have done that certain retention levels. are satisfied on the retrocessional side. That piece of the equation is more mechanical. than at that stage. And the same goes for our K-securitization. Once a business qualifies. for session under K, we have a full follow fortunes principle. And therefore to the extent. we are booking -- specific IBNRs on those contracts, this would filter through to our K. transaction. And lastly in Q3, we have started to already -- to also see a lot advisers under. our ILS fronting activities. And they are, of course, directly channeled to the investor base. for which we are doing the fronting.. Vinit Malhotra. And so even for the fourth quarter, you still think you're still very comfortable with the. situation on COVID P&C, Sven?. Sven Althoff. We are comfortable. I wouldn't say very. I mean, the pandemic is ongoing. We have the. second wave of partial lockdown mechanisms. You and I, we have both no idea whether. that's a November topic or whether this will lead well into 2021. So from that point of view,. we feel that we are well reserved, that we have good cushions on the IBNR side. But. there's still significant uncertainty as far as the extent and the duration of the lockdown is. concerned, and the economic consequences coming with that.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Yes.. Klaus Miller. Yes. On the life side, I might have to disappoint you. My former answers are still valid. We. mortality has been as you mentioned, at 20% higher than expected. About 70% of that is. explained by the COVID claims directly. That means that's the death certificate same. level. Reporting is not that great. Then also significant impact might come from fewer. people seeking medical treatment for serious medical issues because of a fear of COVID,. so they don't go to the hospital. And there is also very likely we would call it deaths of. despair like suicide, opioids, things like that. This translates into a portfolio death rate of. perhaps less than 5% because of the age distribution. The average age of COVID deaths,. I guess in the U.S. and this is the market we track closely, because most of our claims. come from there, is the age is still about 68. It's significantly higher in other countries like,. Germany. We have 80 to 82 and basically no claims in our portfolio. In the U.S., you have. permanent business. In the UK, you have a little bit of what you call all of life business. But. this is relatively negligible for our portfolio at least in the UK.. Then the claims we see are significantly lower than the average plan, what we have. We. have only seen eight claims above $1 million so far. And that is significantly lower than we. would usually expect. So this explains the big difference, but it all depends on the age. distribution in your portfolio. And as you might remember, we have been able to get rid of. a lot of this in the last two years by recaptured. I hope that answers your question, but I'm. sure you will ask it again in three months' time. And then I might have another answer.. Vinit Malhotra. Right. We'll look forward to that. Thank you very much.. Klaus Miller. Sorry.. Operator. Our next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now go. ahead. Your line is now open.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions. The first one would be related to. the special dividend again. Sorry about that. Understand your remark regarding still a. question mark on how strong the one-one renewals could be. But if I remember well, you. issued a EUR500 million subordinated bond in Q2, if I'm right. And that was not for, I. would say, clear refinancing purposes. I see that at that time, you indicated that you raised. a bond in order to have some additional flexibility if business opportunities were stronger. than expected. So could you maybe rephrase your special divi comment, taking into. consideration the EUR500 million hybrid bond?. And my second question will be related to COVID-19 additional reserves, you booked in. Q3 on credit and surety and also in the other lines. That's where obviously the increase. has been. But clearly we have not seen yet any substantive news flows on these two lines.. So maybe you could shed some light on what has driven the increase in those two lines in. terms of additional reserves? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Clemens, special dividend first.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thomas, happy to clarify to add some information to the hybrid situation and the. special dividend. In general, yes, it's -- you're perfectly right. We did raise a hybrid bond in. the second quarter. However, and I probably have not been so clear on that earlier. I. apologize. So I think we -- that was only, one, to refinance the early call bond that we. called in the third quarter. So that was actually a refinancing act, which we always knew. that wouldn't really add capital to our position.. As you know, yes, there is headroom for further financing activities. Of course, we will look. dividend. And of course, please bear in mind that when you look at our guidance for. 2020, the more than EUR800 million already translate to roughly 60% payout ratio for the. basis dividend, of course. So that's something that we kept in mind as well. But again, we. will revisit that position earlier in 2021.. I hope, Thomas, that answers the question to some extent on the hybrid front.. Thomas Fossard. Yes, thank you.. Sven Althoff. When it comes to the COVID losses, let me start with the credit side. Yes, you're right. We. have a relatively little news as far as individual insolvencies is concerned. Here, the various. state stimulus programs for the economy are doing their job. So we have strong stimulus. packages. We have rules in place, lifting the requirements for declaring insolvencies. So. therefore this problem not gone away, but it's pushed us into the future. Let me put it this. way. So from a pure accident year point of view, there would be very little need to do any. reserving on the credit and surety as regards COVID this year. So you have to see the. EUR180 million we have booked here as a precaution for future insolvencies, which most. likely will not happen 2020, but in later years. The exact timing, of course, is unknown. The. reason for the increase from Q2 to Q3 has to be understood in the context that of. course, we have earned additional premium in the third quarter. So therefore, we have. booked some additional IBNRs on that additionally earned premium adding to the. precaution we had taken in Q2.. When it comes to business interruption, we have more advances from our ceding. companies from a variety of regions. I guess the best publicized situation in the last. couple of weeks has been the UK with the FCA test case and the outcome of first ruling.. Ceding companies, of course, have translated that ruling into losses as far as their. portfolio is concerned have advised those losses to us. And we have booked them. accordingly. And as I've mentioned before, we have taken this as, yes, a requirement to. proportionately build additional IBNRs on top of that in order to stay at a comfortable level. when it comes to actually advice claims to IBNRs and the overall reserve situation.. Thomas Fossard. So thank you. Maybe one word, if you could on the other lines, so maybe the financials. and D&O lines where things have increased as well?. Sven Althoff. Yes. There was a relatively proportionate increase in all lines of business. If you look at Q2. where we had booked EUR600 million and Q3 the EUR873 million, which we have booked. on a gross basis, we have added to our Q2 results in all those lines of business. But. depending on the news we received from the ceding companies to a varying extent, the. largest increase we have certainly shown is on the property business interruption side. But. there were also additional ins against lines of business like D&O.. Thomas Fossard. Okay. Thanks, Sven.. Operator. Our next question is from Paris Hadjiantonis, Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your. line is now open.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes. Hi from my side as well. I hope everybody's doing well. The first question will be on. Solvency II. And what is assumed currently in terms of COVID-19 losses going forward? I. think Klaus implied earlier that some low triple digit million for higher mortality claims from. the U.S. is already assumed, but can you please give us an idea both on Life Re and I don't. know whether there's anything on the P&C side as well?. I mean relating to that question, since you are assuming some losses from mortality and. looking at your guidance for 2021. I know you're trying to provide a normalized basis. But. can you be a bit more clear on whether or not these assumed losses on Life Re are. already included in the guidance you have given for 2021?. And then a small one, again on the Life Re side. Looking at your appendix, Slide 23, about. one-third of the life and health losses are coming from non-mortality, so morbidity and. other. Can you just give us some light on what exactly is driving this morbidity and other. losses? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So Clemens will comment on what's baked into the Solvency II numbers, and. then Klaus will take the other questions then.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Paris, exactly as you assume, there's a different picture on P&C and life and health. both under IFRS and Solvency II regime under P&C, I think, it's fair to say what we show in. our IFRS numbers is reflected in our Solvency II numbers already. So that really translates. sort of into each other. On the life and health side, I would probably make some general. remarks and then hand over to Klaus to add a bit more specifics on the numbers. probably. But in general, I think in IFRS, it's pretty much the same as on the P&C side. unless you do see future losses that don't want to be too technical, but that do not. surpass the loss recognition test. So then you are able to account for future losses under. IFRS regime other than that. And our current numbers do not reflect that. But Klaus will. shed some light particularly on the Australian business.. In -- on Solvency II, I think it's fair to say we haven't really adjusted our long-term. assumptions both for mortality and morbidity. That is not reflected in Solvency II. However,. on the short term, let's say probably the next quarter and probably somewhat into 2021 is. reflected in Solvency II reserves already. But Klaus, you might be able to shed some more. light on that.. Klaus Miller. Yes. Let's start with the Solvency II numbers. I have just the numbers for the U.S., and this. is about EUR100 million for the fourth quarter and 2021. About EUR30 million is for the. fourth quarter and the rest for the year 2021 under Solvency II. There is no loss recognition. in the U.S., because the buffers are high under IFRS. So you won't see that in the same. cushion or buffer you won't see under IFRS.. And the other thing, Clemens already mentioned. In Australia the disability business was. loss making the last couple of years and this has been a significant problem for us in the. past. And we had loss recognition under IFRS 4. So that any changes we make to our IFRS. numbers would go straight to the bottom line. And here we expect some economic. downturn in 2021, which usually leads to higher disability claims in the sense that. reactivation probabilities will go down. This could happen for various reasons, but. definitely it will happen for COVID-19 reasons. There will be an economic downturn. That's. what we expect for 2021. And we have about, I guess, EUR44 million in additional reserves. put aside for the economic downturn-related lower reactivation rates in 2021. So this is a. cushion for next year. But this is only possible under IFRS 4, because we are already in loss. recognition for the disability business in Australia.. Clemens Jungsthof el. So Paris, to be clear that is really what you see under both regimes, right, under Solvency. II. And IFRS as Klaus mentioned, something that we don't see in 2020, but we expect in. 2021. However, we have taken care of that already as a sort of a second order effect. related to COVID, to some extent, already in our 2020 numbers.. Klaus Miller. According to my definition, this is even a third order effect. The first order is COVID claims. -- named COVID claims. The second is the claims I mentioned earlier from death of. despair few sites -- or fewer people seeking medical treatment and die of a heart attack,. because they don't go to hospital. The third order effect -- impact would be an economic. downturn, which across the world has an impact on our disability claims. Does that answer. your question?. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes, thank you. Just to come back to the guidance, Klaus, you are saying that in the U.S.. mortality, you're talking about EUR17 million impact in 2021 and then also some on the. morbidity side in Australia. Are these already reflected in your guidance for 2021 in terms. of IFRS profits?. Klaus Miller. Yes.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes, okay.. Operator. Our next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is now. open.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi there. Just a very quick question. I'm assuming your willingness to talk about the. dividend means that you're assuming the regulator in Germany, BaFin, will be as. pragmatic year-end dividend discussions as they were with the FY '19. Is that your working. assumption? Have you been given any indications so far on that?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So we didn't have a direct discussion yet on this, but we expect based on the dialogue. we've had in the past months to have a pragmatic perspective from the regulator in. Germany. That's the assumption. I feel optimistic that this will be confirmed as we start the. New Year. But my assumption is that we'll have -- based on the numbers, based on the. performance and the strong reserving position and the business outlook that BaFin would. confirm the dividend.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) We haven't received further questions. I will hand back to the. speakers.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much for taking part of this call and for the questions. So we wanted. to convey the message that our year-to-date figures are now solid enough to provide. guidance. Of course, some moving parts and some potential for changes in the fourth. quarter. There is some NatCat activity, in particular, but we feel confident in the EUR800. million are stated with a high confidence level.. We have robust reserving with COVID-19. The impact is yet to be confirmed, but I think. there's more solidity in the numbers. And we understand more and more where we are.. The primary wordings are changing, the reinsurance wordings will be changing. So the. exposure will be reduced quite significantly. And on the guidance 2021, clearly lots of. uncertainties. We took account of the economic outlook, which might not be very, very. positive. But we see increasing momentum in P&C. We expect the hardening of the. market and that's the main opportunity for us in 2021. And once we have this highlighted. and more visibility on how we fare, I think we can confirm the dividend assumptions for. the next year. So we'll have an opportunity in the New Year to comment on the renewals.. Of course, we will give you an update on the outlook on '21 and obviously, the dividend. decisions, which as always is being taken in the New Year.. Thank you very much for your attention, and have a good day.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded.

7,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on 1st January, 2021, Property and Casualty Treaty Renewals. For your. information, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call. over to your host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please, go. ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Hi, good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining this conference call. presenting the outcome of the January renewal for our P&C treaty reinsurance book. As. usual, I'll start with an overview before our Executive for P&C Business Coordinator, Sven. Althoff goes over the details of the renewals outcome. I'll then comment on the outlook. for the year thereafter.. Let me start with a few general comments on the market environment. Overall, I'd say,. the positive momentum we have observed in the last couple of years and in particular in. 2020 has continued and we've seen another year of improving rate quality for the. reinsurance industry. Additionally, the primary insurance markets have experienced a. significant improvement in many geographies and lines of business. In some case we've. seen the second or even the third consecutive year of increased premium quality, which is. of course particularly positive for our proportional reinsurance business where we directly. benefit from the developments in the primary markets.. Drivers for these developments were higher than average loss experienced in the past. four years and the continued challenging interest rate environment. As COVID was a. significant loss complex, but not capital event in 2020 for the reinsurance industry. We're. not in a disruptive market environment. We have seen capacity available. So I would call. this an orderly renewal and hence price changes were in my view overall satisfactory but. of course more moderate than some market observers had initially expected.. As always the status of the cycle depends on the capacity and demand mechanism and. even though capital was available for the January renewals. This time, the pricing power. was more favorable to the suppliers, which largely acted in a disciplined manner.. Therefore, the market firming was broad-based and accompanied by improving terms. and conditions, particularly regarding pandemic exclusions and silent cyber exposure.. As usual, the trends in this renewal did vary quite notably depending on geographies and. lines of business, when it comes to the level of pricing adjustments. In general most. dynamic development could be observed in North America, in the UK, and in the specialty. business classes.. Finally, I'd say that, this renewal has underlined that the reinsurance market was willing to. allocate capital and to support their client's needs, and has therefore shown the. relevance of the reinsurance market in this turbulent environment.. Moving on to the Hannover Re Treaty Renewal, I'd say that the most of the described. factors were also true for our own portfolio with improvements in the primary markets,. reinsurance rates being adjusted up as well as terms and conditions, adding up to a. clearly improved quality of the portfolio. Additionally, we at Hannover Re have continued. to benefit from the flight to quality which is a long-term trend in our business and given. our financial strength and the excellent market positions, we could feel that trend again. during the renewals.. Therefore, I'm very pleased with the outcome of this renewal. The total price increase. was 5.5% and the risk adjusted price change for non-proportional business was even. higher at 8%. Sven, will show you in a minute that this brings our book to a level surpassing. the risk-adjusted trade quality seen in 2012 and '13, before the last phase of the. significant market softening started.. Looking at the premium volume, our book grew by 8.5% in a firming market. You've seen. high growth rates. At Hannover Re in the past years, our focus here was on improving the. portfolio quality, and therefore, the growth of our portfolio was mainly driven by price. increases and less by an additional expansion of the P&C book. We also did not shy away. from not renewing business or not fully renewing our lines where the profitability targets. were not met by our underwriters judgment.. Additionally, the growth we have seen it does not include our facultative business,. structured reinsurance and other non-traditional reinsurance business. On top of this, we. do expect to see some more growth opportunities in the upcoming renewals as well as in. the non-traditional lines. Last but not least, the demand for insurance was in some cases. dampened by reduced reinsurance commissions, by the fact that some primary insurance. premium is calculated on business activity i.e. turnover or mileages et cetera.. In addition we have clearly steered our risk appetite in the nat cat segment, and we're. successful in diversifying the book outside of the U.S., where we were not willing to. allocate significantly more capital.. I'm particularly pleased with our team managing our retrocession. They've successfully. renewed the retro programs and placed the targeted level of coverage at a reasonable. price, which is risk-adjusted, well in line with the reinsurance market and could be. absorbed by our own business portfolio.. Last but not least, the ability to grow our book and to achieve high profitability is also. based on one of our key competitive advantages, namely our low admin expense ratio.. Therefore, it is important for us to further build on this advantage. This is in a nutshell the. development of this renewal and I'm pleased to hand over to Sven who will give you. some more insights on our renewal performance.. Sven Althoff. Thank you, Jean-Jacques and also a very warm welcome from my side. Today, we are. reporting about the treaty business which was up for renewal at the 1st of January. This. represents a total number of EUR7.7 billion of premium out of our EUR15.9 million of. premium. So overall 67% of our treaty business and 49% of our total P&C business.. On the right hand side of the graph, you can see the regional splits of our renewable. portfolio, EMEA is of particular importance for us at the 1st of January, given that almost. 90% of our total EMEA portfolio renews at 1st of January and also when it comes to the. specialty lines, a very significant part of that business is also focused at around 1/1. If. you're interested in the details, you can see a slide in the appendix where we show the. premium that is going to renew later in the year and from that slide, you will notice that. when it comes to the Americas and the APAC regions, there are significant volumes to. come at the first of April, 1st of June and 1st of July renewal dates.. Out of the EUR7.7 billion of premium that was up for renewal, we non-renewed our ceding. companies restructured business of -- in the amount of more than EUR700 million leaving. EUR7 billion of premium that we actually renewed. After the renewal this turned into. EUR715 million more, where the most influential part of this increase is actually the. increase in price which was 5.5%. This compares to 2.3% which we had reported a year. ago, so much more positive. And we had smaller contributions from the change in our. shares and the change in the underlying premium from our ceding companies.. The EUR680 million we could again show a significant amount of new business. This was. very diversified again like in the last years with particular emphasis in the German market. this year and our North American portfolio and business coming from the London market.. Overall, we grew the business by 8.5% up to 8.4 trillion[ph].. As you can see, we had premium and price increases across all lines and regions with the. most dynamic development in the U.S., London market and specialty lines. The only area. where we had a slight drop in premium income, despite positive price momentum is our. agricultural portfolio and I'll come back to that in a few slides to give you the reason, why?. We look into our business on a proportional and non-proportional basis, this slide is giving. you more details. So you can see that the proportion of portfolio shows an overall price. increase of 4.4%, all regions and product lines have contributed to this and again, it. compares favorably to the 2.1%, which we reported a year ago.. On the non-proportional business, we have seen even more positive momentum with an. overall price change of 8.8%, this is significantly higher than the 2.9% we had reported a. year ago and only slightly below the 9.9% we reported for our 1st of June, 1st of July. renewals last year. But you have to remember that the 1st of June and 1st of July business. last year was very involved in previous loss activity. So mainly in the U.S., Chile and. Australia and at the 1st of January renewal, we have a much more diversified portfolio.. The best price momentum we can -- could see from a regional perspective coming out of. the Americas, both North and South America and from our specialty lines of business.. Jean-Jacques already mentioned that adding our 8.8% of positive price development on. the non-proportional business, this has been the most pronounced rate increase we could. observe in the last 10 years cycle and adding or deducting all the price movements we. have reported over the last 10 years to you, this now brings us to a level exceeding 2011.. But let me give you a little more detail when it comes to our various portfolios starting. with EMEA.. In EMEA, the overall premium grew by 10.6% and this is on the back of a price increase of. 3%. We had firming of the rates both on the primary side and on the reinsurance side. The. most notable firming on the primary side was coming out of our UK portfolio. Reinsurance. rates were firming across all geographies and as Jean-Jacques already indicated, we. were also able to improve terms and conditions.. We have increased our share in Lloyd's markets with a particular emphasis behind our. wholly owned subsidiary Argenta. The flagship syndicate of Argenta 2121 is not a fully. aligned syndicate, but we have now grown our participation behind that syndicate to more. than 50%.. Germany was particularly successful renewal, our subsidiary E+S is one of the market. leaders in that market and despite this already very strong market position we could again. widen our client base and increase our participation on existing programs.. In North America, the premium growth was even more pronounced at 15% on the back of. a price increase of 8.3%. Here again, we had very positive trends both on the primary and. on the reinsurance side across both Property & Casualty, we could successfully introduce. pandemic exclusions and made very many cases also silent cyber exclusions in our. renewal portfolio, and this allowed us to materialize premium growth across both Property. & Casualty lines. Also Latin and South America was a successful renewal, in particular. Chile, again showed good levels of the rate increase following the losses we had in Chile. from the riots, a year ago.. On the APAC side, the growth was a little less pronounced compared to previous years. was 4.1%. Here the price increases actually exceeding our premium growth with 6.1%. We. had successful renewal in Southeast Asia and Korea, where we were able to write more. volumes of business at more attractive terms and conditions. But where we had to drop in. volume was out of our Mainland China portfolio which from a single territory perspective is. the biggest contributor to our APAC premium. And the reason behind that is twofold;. firstly, we did not achieve the levels of rate improvement that we wanted to achieve. And. secondly, we have a few market dynamics in China like the deregulation of the motor. business, which has led to a reduction in our premium income from the Chinese market. overall.. Turning to the specialty classes, we grew our credit, surety and political risk portfolio by. slightly above 5% with a very pleasing development on the pricing side where we almost. hit 10% as an overall increase. This was a first step of a hardening as a result of the. uncertainties linked to COVID-19. There are relatively few incurred losses in credit and. surety at this stage given the various government stimulus packages and monetary. stimulus packages plus the fact that in quite a number of the countries credit insurers had. spec stop solutions from the governments.. But nonetheless, given the overall economic recession, we still have to expect a certain. vehicle of insolvencies, once those packages and protection mechanisms are phasing out. and given that level of uncertainty in this portfolio we were able to successfully negotiate. strong price increases. We have only very selectively grown our client and exposure base,. given the background of the economic recession, but overall, a very pleasing renewal.. In marine and aviation, the growth was a little more pronounced. It was 8.2%, again, very. good pricing momentum with 11% of an overall increase, this was on the back of various. losses both on the aviation and on the marine side. So we were able to not only. significantly increase the rates on the non-proportionate business, but could also. negotiate lesser commissions on the proportionate structures. In both markets, we see a. strong momentum on the insurance pricing, so the quality of our pro rata book has. certainly significantly improved. However, premium volumes continued to be more stable. due to the depressed turnovers given the global situation particularly with that particular. impact on flying activity and the airline industry.. As already mentioned a few slides ago on the agricultural side, we have dropped our. premium income by almost 15%, despite the fact that we are able to show an overall price. increase of 3.4%. We had various developments in this particular portfolio. So a good. growth and increased shares in countries like the Americas, Eastern Europe and Turkey. but a rather significant drop of our premium income in China.. Here the background is the fact that following the African swine fever, China experienced. at the end of 2019. The Chinese government decided to establish a state-owned. reinsurer for agricultural health and they are given the priority session before the open. market and that priority session made the overall premium pool for the open market. significantly smaller, and hence, resulted in a drop of our Chinese agricultural premium.. When it comes to the non-treaty business, so restructured reinsurance and the facultative. reinsurance, we wanted to give you a little bit of an insight of how we fared at the 1/1. renewal. In structured reinsurance, we continue to see a very high demand for solvency. relief transactions worldwide. We have been successful to close an exceptional high. number of new transactions at the 1/1 renewal. We lost only one contract, so a good. growth in our structured portfolio at 1/1. We expect that trend to continue throughout the. rest of the year. And overall we do expect a premium development in the lower doubledigits area for this portfolio.. In the facultative side, we are participating in the positive development on the insurance. side, we have seen a significant flight to quality. So policyholders in facultative reinsurance,. buyers have been very security-minded and there was a lot of demand for Hannover Re. securities, which we could successfully turn into new business opportunities. In addition to. the pandemic exclusions and silent cyber exclusions I have already mentioned earlier, we. can also report further improvements in terms and conditions on the facultative side. So. very often we have seen increases in underlying deductibles and reductions in. supplements for certain exposures like, non-damage business interaction coverage, and. overall the rate increase we can report as 8%, but up to 20% in territories like North. America, or product lines like particularly downstream energy.. Summarizing, our cat renewal at the 1st of January, we can see that there was widespread. improvement of our portfolio on a -- from a terms and conditions point of view in most. regions. The most positive rate movement we can report from our U.S. renewals with. about 10% risk adjusted Europe and the rest of the world was ranging in the 2.5% to 5%. range. Our premium nonetheless grew more pronounced in APAC and EMEA for the. reason that was already mentioned by Jean-Jacques, despite the fact that the strongest. rate increase came from the United States renewals.. We were not willing to dedicate more capital to particularly U.S. wind coverage. So we are. participating in the positive rate increase of 10% for that (inaudible), but we have not seen. this as an opportunity to significantly widen our exposure base on that side. Overall, we. can report that we had diversified growth of almost 10% in our cat portfolio.. Coming to my final slide on the retrocessional side, we had a rather positive renewal. season. We were able to increase the limits that have been placed both in our. aggregates on large loss, excess of loss structure from EUR200 million to EUR225 million.. We have also placed slightly more of our whole account protection coming from EUR325. million, going up to EUR337 million, where we have placed a little less as our proportional. of co-efficient, where last year we secured a paid-in capital of $680 million, this year of. $610 million. We could have placed more, but we did not wish to compromise on terms. and conditions more substantially also in light of the fact that the protected portfolio has. been seeing good improvements on the incoming side.. So overall, we have been able to place according to our net risk appetite targets and the. price adjustments we had to pay we're fully in line with the price increases we achieved. on the incoming portfolio. So from a net position, a very welcome outcome of our retro. renewals.. With that, I would hand over to you, Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, Sven for this overview. Now let me come to the guidance for 2021.. Firstly, showing you the usual overview of the volume and profitability expectations. Just. as a reminder, we're now looking at the financial year perspective. As we have seen in the. 1/1 renewal report in most of the markets and segments, we continue to grow based on. the positive change in pricing, in terms explained before. We expect particularly strong. profitability in North America and EMEA and specialty lines, but more importantly all lines. are expected to earn an at or above cost of capital level. Therefore, the overall picture is. quite satisfactory from our own point of view.. In terms of guidance, even though there are some moving parts with the development of. the pandemic and the P&C renewals, I can confirm the outlook for 2021 already. communicated last year in November in terms of volume. The renewals have confirmed. our growth target, but we also have some important renewals later in the year, and there. might be further opportunities to grow.. Additionally, as Sven reported the structured reinsurance and facultative business which. are not only 1/1 renewals have a good pipeline for the remainder of the year. And finally,. the -- in Life & Health, we have a strong pipeline for new business, particularly in financial. solutions, but it's too early to revisit our guidance for the year. Therefore, we left the. volume guidance for the group unchanged, but there is probably more upside potential. than downside risk in my view.. The return on investment is at 2.4%, taking into account the deterioration of the interest. rates levels. We have maintained the group net income target in the range of EUR1.15. billion to EUR1.25 billion. In P&C, we now feel much more comfortable with achieving our. 96% combined ratio target but this is also needed to offset the declining ROIs. This is also. supported by the reserving for COVID-19 related losses we did in Q4, 2020, which has. significantly reduced the risk for further additional reserving in 2021.. On the other hand, we have to expect further COVID losses in our Life & Health business. group in particular driven by the expected development in the U.S. at least until we see. the positive effect from the vaccination campaigns. So I would expect Q1 and Q2 to be. impacted with a significant improvement later on in the year. We still do not see the need. to change our group guidance firstly as a part of this development was initially already. included in the outlook, but secondly also because we expect to see a positive one-off. effect in Q1 2021 triggered by a restructuring of the reinsurance arrangement or the ING. portfolio. Altogether, this will help to mitigate the somewhat increased expectation or. additional COVID losses.. Regarding the dividends, we continue our policy of paying out 35% to 45% of the group's. net income, as an ordinary dividend and consider an additional special dividend if we. reach our profit guidance for the year and have a comfortable level of capitalization. As. usual, we published at this time of the year our preliminary key figures for the previous. year. The full set of numbers, as you know, will be presented to you on March 11. So at this. stage just a few comments on these preliminary figures.. In terms of gross written premium we were able to exceed our guidance. In the end, we. achieved a growth rate of around 12%. This is predominantly due to the expansion of our. P&C business, where we continue to have strong momentum in 2020. The return on. investment is expected to reach 3%, which is well in excess of the 2.7% and which we. mentioned last time, benefiting from a higher realized gains and one-off effect from an. equity participation in the fourth quarter.. The group net income of EUR883 million is very satisfactory and this bearing in mind that. we're looking back at an extraordinary year with total claims related to COVID-19 of. around EUR1.2 billion for the Hannover Re Group life and non-life.. The P&C, COVID loss estimates increased by EUR250 million in the fourth quarter, which. is more than we indicated in November. Here, we've taken a more conservative and also. more long-term view on the loss expectations with further reserves added for event. cancellations, credit and surety and also long tail lines like casualty. This also entirely. explains the combined ratio of 101.6% which would be around 97% excluding the. exceedance of our large loss budget. The COVID related losses in Life & Health were at. about EUR100 million in the fourth quarter, mainly from our U.S. business, which should be. less surprising given the development in this country. As usual, we will communicate the. decision on our dividends in March, together with the full details of numbers for the fullyear financial results.. At this stage, however, I can confirm that we expect to pay at least, EUR4 per share. regarding the decision on the possibility of a special dividend. We will particularly look at. the expected growth opportunities over the course of this year, as well as 2022, where. we expect continuous growth momentum.. All together, Hannover Re again proved its resilience and the ability to achieve solid. results even in a very difficult year like, 2020. We'll give you the figures in full detail on the. conference call on March 11, as mentioned.. So with that, I close the presentation part and would welcome your comments, feedback. or questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Question And Answer). Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) And the first question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. One on 2020, and then another one on the. 2021 guidance. I guess given your decision to take a more cautious view in the fourth. quarter for 2020, could you maybe give us an idea of how much IBNR is as a percentage. of total COVID claims and how material kind of this conscious for you has been in. changing that? So that's the first question.. The second question is just really interested in the sake of guidance for 2021. My kind of. way to put to what you're saying this morning is that you feel more positive in P&C, but. clearly excess debts on going away in the near term. Are you now thinking about the. guidance being kind of slightly worse in Life and slightly better in P&C?. And I guess, the second part to that question is, I guess, one of the footnotes in your. guidance talked about for 2021, excluding material impact from excess kind of mortality. trends. But you talked about Q1, Q2 probably having those trends. So is that factored into. EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25 billion? Any thoughts about kind of the meaning of the word. materiality would be really helpful? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Very good. Maybe I'll ask Sven to give the percentage of IBNR at this stage.. Sven Althoff. Yes, as you would expect we had additional losses reported from our -- companies due in. the course of fourth quarter. One of the drivers behind our decision to increase our -reserves was to keep a robust level of IBNR, what we could report in the previous. quarters. So, the EUR950 million we are showing on the P&C side is still 2/3 -approximately 2/3 IBNR.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. have on the price side is broadly speaking in line with our expectations before the. renewals. We will need to see how much growth we continue to have. But certainly there. is some upside and some of the upsides is not only price related, but also related to the. pipeline of non-traditional solutions. There is good demand and good momentum there. as well. So depending on the -- on how it plays out it might be within our expectations or. ahead of them. So too early to say, I would say, for P&C.. For Life & Health, clearly the expectations or the excess mortality, particularly in the U.S.. last time we talked in the fall was a bit less than what we incurred. So Q4, roughly. speaking EUR100 million. It may reflect what comes out in Q1, possibly Q2 a lot will. depend on the vaccination programs. Of course, the vaccinations are focused on the. high-risk groups. So that might lead to a better effect on what we see in the first half of. the year. We also see that the delta between overall population and insured population. continues to be quite material. We have an excess mortality on our U.S. book of about 6%. at this stage versus roughly speaking 15% in the overall population. So this remains stable.. So probably some more exposures and in Q1, possibly Q2, but on the other hand, we. have some positive one-off effect on our business which will to a great extent. compensate possible higher exposure in Q1. And we continue to have very, very good. momentum in the transactional space in financial solutions, which partly is reflected in our. 2020 results, but I also see very, very strong pipeline for '21. So, I would say, yes, possibly. a slightly worse in terms of COVID burden initially in the year, possibly, compared to what. we said in November, but we have one-off effect and better traction than expected in in. financial solutions. So overall, I'd say the guidance that is can be confirmed and the level. of confidence we have in this guidance has been increased based on what we know.. Kamran Hossain. Fantastic. Thanks very much for the answer.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Good morning. Thank you very much. So my first thing is that the -- just a little bit on the. exceptional disclosure on the structured book, one of the things I noticed in your outlook. is that your profitability or structure reinsurance impairment showing good positive sign.. So, I'm just curious if it's the function of supply and demand? Is it likely that we should think. of a better combined ratio for the structured reinsurance going forward or in '21 at least?. Any comment on that would be helpful.. Second thing is, I just noticed the comment you made about the fourth quarter COVID. claims, could you just shed a bit more light on the casualty element you said, where. workers driven by some COVID-related social inflation impact? And secondly also will. there be any growth and net disclosure that you're able to share now, or we wait for 11th. March? And my third and final question is on Sven's comment on U.S. nat cat where 10%. pricing achieved, but lower volume, could you just share any more comment on that,. please? Thank you.. Maybe I can say just a few words on the non-traditional business and ask Sven to. comment on casualty and nat cat, also complement on structure. But I'd say this is the. non-traditional space is a little bit different in terms of dynamics. What we see is its. continued demand, I think the uncertainty on our clients' financials and strategic shifts. create demand, so we see that increase in demand. It's not a segment, which is totally in. line with the traditional market in terms of supply and demand, you need to look at it. separately.. So you don't have the same type of swings. It's more tailor-made. It's one-off. So, I would. say there is possibly a bit more demand, but we don't have the totality of the market, it's. very difficult to know. A lot of the opportunities are created, they are not part of an. existing book of business being reviewed -- renewed. So, I would say, very, very difficult to. say at this stage. I would not really anticipate a significant change in combined ratio. performance for our non-traditional book, but I would expect this increased demand to. continue over the year.. Sven Althoff. When it comes to COVID and casualty, we still have very few loss situations reported from. our -- companies. So out of a certain prudency, we have decided to look a few additional. loss ratio points across most of our casualty portfolio. We have no insight into which. particular area of capacity will be impacted by COVID-19. So, we do of course expect. certain losses to be reported under the coverages for example, but overall our approach. has been a little more broad -- by increasing our -- last in order to recognize this. uncertainty, which in the end in a few years' time, I'm sure we'll show that in some product. lines, we will have been too high, in some product lines we will have been too low, but. overall when it comes to Casualty, we are comfortable with the recent inquisition that we. have now established.. On the U.S. -- catastrophe side, we have renewed a stable portfolio from an exposure. base, so we have not reduced our participation on the U.S. -- side, but we had no interest. peak peril by quite a margin from a net exposure base followed by U.S. earthquake and. from a diversification point of view, we have decided already in 2019, that for us, it makes. with our existing U.S. winds portfolio, and that maybe in a few years' time, we start. yes, exceed the other perils we can write from a diversification point of view even more. Vinit Malhotra. Concerning the capital allocation on nat cat remained around 18% or?. Sven Althoff. Could you say that again, please?. Vinit Malhotra. The capital allocation to NatCat, it went sort of stable as well, 18% or has it gone up?. Sven Althoff. It's around 18% slightly up from the 16-and-a-bit percent in previous years.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Andrew Richie. Hi, there. A couple of questions. So, Sven, could you just give us some perspective on. what you expect in later renewals? I'm sort of not sure to what degree some of those. later renewals on loss affected or not. Clearly, Japan is less effective than it was, but in. mid-year, some of it will -- some of it weren't -- just give us a perspective as to what. you're thinking about those later renewals?. The second question and I'm still quite judging what in the U.S. your growth -- was it. casualty versus property? Was it that we have to grow both? Was there a bias in it? Just. And the final one is I think it's a very quick answer to this, but I'm assuming the reduction in. the capital of the -- won't materially affect the session rate, I think is 42% of your cat. exposed business, but I presume that won't change much but you did mention that you're. going to retain the bit more. So what will the recession rate be? Thanks.. Sven Althoff. Okay. Thank you for those questions. We are positive when it comes to the renewals at. the 1 April, and 1 June, 1 July date. You're right. Japan has been a benign loss environment. in 2020 from a NatCat point of view. But at the same time we had a very active hurricane. season in the two previous years, and at least according to the conversation we had with. our clients in Japan, they made it clear, that the rate increases we achieved in 2020 is not. 100% sufficient to cater for our new -- risk. So there is more to come at the 2021 renewal.. This development maybe less pronounced compared to last year, but it will still be a. positive momentum.. The U.S. had lots of nat cat activity is this year, we had a very significant tornados the racial. situation. We hadn't record high number of hurricanes, and one of them was Laura was of. a certain significance. So, overall, again, a situation where there was a lot of frequency and. that should keep the momentum positive on the net cash renewed in North America. And. lastly in Australia, I mean, Australia will have really had terrible two years on the net cash. side and not all of that is completely priced in. We could see that with the very few. renewals in Australia, we had at the first of January renewal that there was strong positive. momentum on the non-proportional business and I would see no reason why that's. momentum should not materialize the gap 1st of July renewals.. Our growth in North America Andrew is very, very diversified, so we have grown in. property, we have grown in casualty more or less to the same proportions, part of North. America is obviously also Canada. So in Canada, we have also shown significant growth on. the motor side. So overall a diversified approach with us not emphasizing property over. casualty or the other way around, so rather similar approach compared to both approach. we have taken in the last two renewal cycles. And finally your question on the -- session. that's dropped by approximately 5 percentage points to 37%, but as you have mentioned. and that explained by me when I talked about our red processions. This comes at a. moment in time when the incoming portfolio is at a much better rate in quality compared. to previous years. So from a momentum -- cycle management point of view, we felt that. an appropriate moment in time to have the session to go drop a little bit.. Andrew Richie. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one will be relating to your one-one. renewals and the impact of COVID-19. Reading the reinsurance brokers for stake at the. start of the year. It looks like somewhere saying that COVID-19 has been to some extent. side of the renewals because of two complex issues colliding at the same time. So, I'm a. bit wondering if you believe that COVID-19 has been already reflected in the pricing. through terms and conditions and exclusions or do you think that potentially there could. be some pricing momentum in the coming or newest come or later in 2022 more to. adjust specifically for the COVID-19 losses. So just better understanding of what has been. the impact there?. And the second question will be on the 4.4% increase in personal. I think that's when last. year you commented that usually when Hannover Rueck is showing this number on. proportional -- this is mainly the change in the ceiling commission and that you're not. taking a view on the underlying pricing change. Now you're showing 4.4 this year. So I get. that, 4.4 is not the only impact from changing ceiling commissions, but you can say, well. done this. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Sure. Happy to comment on both. To what extent has COVID been reflected in the. renewal pricing here? I have to report that this is a very diverse situation in some. portfolios like, the event cancellation portfolio where coverage on the reinsurance. contract is very clear. The impact of COVID was fully priced in the regional community has. situation is very clear. In -- nothing has really happened yet. So from an incurred. perspective, there were relatively few insolvencies reported in 2020.. development of the economic cycle and hence the situation on the insolvency site. So. when we negotiated the renewal pricing with our credit insurance partners, we talked. about their perception, our perception and came to a conclusion, how this will turn out in. the -- years 2021, 2022 when it comes to the When it comes to the real world. insolvencies, we still have to wait and see that's why we try to phrase it carefully when we. commented on our credit and surety renewals that we see that as a first sign of. hardening, when it comes to COVID-19 related losses.. On the catastrophe driven business, I would say the situation is the most complex. There. still discussions going on between feeding companies and reinsurers about aggregation. of losses, number of events, and as you said, this is another complex. And I would say that. in more cases rather than not, therefore your comment is correct that the COVID situation. has been put to one side to be discussed at a later stage, but get the renewal done first,. and then they deal with the COVID losses during the course of 2021.. So from that point of view, yes there may be further rate increases, but -- companies may. also be minded to maybe seed traditional business, which they have not seeded. historically in order to come to a good level of understanding of what is covered, what is. not covered on the COVID side. So there may be more to come but that situation is a. little unclear right now. When it comes to the price development of 4.4% on the. proportional side, you're absolutely right that I commented last year that for the most part. we are reporting about the movement of the seating commissions in our contracts and. only to a lesser part.. We are reporting about the underlying great momentum on the insurance side like in. previous years. This is a mix, the 4.4% of mainly the development on the ceiling. commission side, but also allowing some of the positive right momentum on the. instruments item on the insurance side to come through in our expected loss ratios for. the proportion of business, but our usual assumptions on proportion of business tends to. be rather sticky. So like I said, last year when we have increases in rates and terms and. conditions, we tend to only adjust the slightly downwards, but at the same time and that's. something I also said last year, if we have rate reductions, we also only adjust them. slightly upwards. So we are not translating those insurance products momentum's 1 to 1. into what we report on the technique the price development in our presentation.. Thomas Fossard. Thank you, sir.. Operator. The next question is from Michael Hermann, Commerzbank. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Michael Hermann Haid. Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions first of all, on the retro renewal. You. mentioned it was successfully renewed. Can you talk a little bit how your retro protect you. changed year-over-year? I think, you already mentioned such the K session, but I would be. interested in the rest of your -- Second question on future claims inflation. How much did it. play a role in the one -- renewals we have seen a significant expansionary monetary. policies of central banks. So maybe, we should expect more loss cost inflation going. forward. Did you change your assumptions regarding future claims inflation going forward. or did you leave them these unchanged? These are my two questions.. Sven Althoff. Okay. On the retro questions as you know, K is a proportional reinsurance vehicle. The. North America, Europe, Japan and Australia on the property side and in addition, we have. our marine and aviation access of loss business protected under case. So there was no. change in that at all. And from that point of view, there are no structural change to report.. The only change is that we have to report as the change in the -- capital behind, which I. already did.. On the non-proportional structures, there were structural changes in addition to the price. -- already mentioned. In both vehicles, we have adjusted our retention slightly upwards,. which is in line with the exposure growth that we have shown over the last few years, you. know that Hannove Re has grown significantly on the P&C side in the last the last three. years which of course also made our underlying exposure base grow and hence we. adjusted our retention slightly upward. But other than that, the structure of our. reinsurance or retrocession program fundamentally unchanged.. On the inflation side, when we priced the business on the P&C side, of course inflation. plays the role, but also the interest rate environment plays the roll. So on the inflation side. -- on the interest rate side, of course, we could only use much lower interest rates when it. comes to discounting of premiums and losses, which was certainly influencing our pricing. up board. On the inflation side, we are trending the inflation assumption we are having. every year, and of course, we did the same again for towards 2021. So that's -- those. were routine adjustment and from that point of view, nothing unusual to report.. Michael Hermann Haid. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Vikram Gandhi, Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi, morning. It's Vik from SocGen. Just a couple from my side. First of all, can you share. what your view is on the potential BI impact from the UK Supreme Court judgement in. other geographies like Australia and South Africa? And separately, if you are seeing some. headwinds coming in the U.S. as well from that as well from that perspective? Secondly,. can you give us a feel of half year redundancy level in the P&C loss reserves should have. developed by year end '19? Thank you.. Unidentified Speaker. Yes, thank you, Vik. I mean, of course, we have tried to understand the Supreme Court. ruling not only in the UK context, but also, when it comes to other common law. jurisdictions like, London, Australia and South Africa, which you have just mentioned. So I. would say that, we have tried to bake in the development we have seen in the UK, also. into those territories. But as you know, in both countries, you will have independent court. cases.. So therefore, it's not guaranteed that the local courts will take want to have one identical. position to what the UK Supreme Court has decided, but as we said here today, I would. say we have tried to make that development into our numbers when we looked at our. year end reserves of COVID-19. When it comes to the redundancy level, I would say it is. still a little bit too early to comment on that and I would like to refer to our 1st of March call. when we get the full year numbers and where we will certainly also comment on the. development of our redundancy levels.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. There are currently no further questions. (Operator Instructions) we have a follow-up. question from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open again.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to check -- If you could be a bit more precise on this one-off. positive that you are expecting from your reinsurance or structuring of your ING Re book. and either going to be Q1 or Q2? That would be the first question. And actually, on the -sorry on the dividend. Why you are not coming with a peer review today? I mean, what do. you expect to be more able to understand our Q4 cat between now and the date of the. publication of your full year number to be more precise on dividend proposal? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Thank you, Thomas. On the one-off effect indeed, this is triggered by -- in the United. States selling its life -- business which as you know include security life of Denver, which. has been ceded -- which has seeded and we continue to seeded the mortality business. we acquired in 2008. So therefore, on the mortality portfolio nothing is changing but the. transaction led to some changes particularly in the collateral structure and a transfer of. assets with some fees which will lead to the mentioned one of -- that's something we. were in the process of quantifying and will confirm that in due course, but it's a material. change and we expect this to be booked in Q1. And obviously this helps compensating. some potential increase in expected excess mortality impacting our book of businesses in. the U.S. with a strong offset in Q1.. On the dividends, of course, the situation is evolving we reflected on the capital. management, we still have some discussions to go in the coming weeks and we wanted. to have an orderly planned announcement as in prior years. We generally talk about and. we talked about the dividend in March, therefore, we opted for the 11th of March, for a. final recommendation. At this stage, we feel confident about the EUR4, that's why I said,. at least, EUR4 per share and we'll consider that in the next few weeks or so. That's the. reason, I don't think that will be earth-shattering developments. But I think they are --a lot. of moving parts we need to look into the capital plan, from a solvency perspective, from a. rating agency perspective. That's why we wanted to give ourselves a little bit of time and. to announce it -- as in the previous year in with March announcements and the conference. call. That's it. No, uncertainty if you want, but just the validation exercise, which we're. currently undertaking.. Thomas Fossard. Okay, understood. Thanks.. Operator. And the next question is from Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca. Your line is now open again.. Vinit Malhotra. Thanks for the chance. Just curiosity on, Sven are you able to break out the COVID. EUR950 million split into some of the lines that you could share if anything, so that's my. first question. Everything is just on the comment on prudence on the reserving actions in. COVID and then if the -- was 71% for and now it's -- what would the effective that we. should be guiding us go up because of prudence so how would we how should we see. that? And in that same comment, are you able to also just discuss the retro mechanism of. the COVID recoveries, and whether it was helpful in fourth quarter, please? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Could you repeat the last question, please.. Vinit Malhotra. So, in the fourth quarter what would be retrocessional recovery because of the whole -being allocated to individual -- K series recovery? Could you just comment on whether. they were going to be recovery quarter from retro for COVID?. Sven Althoff. Okay. I will try my best. Unfortunately your line is very bad. So your questions didn't come. through very well. So starting with your question on the split of the EUR950 million. I would. rather refer to our call on the 11 March, the way of course, we will give that full disclosure.. But given that, it's a preliminary result announcement today, you will appreciate that. similar to what Jean-Jacques has mentioned on the dividend side, we are still doing a lot. of validation effects right now. So I would hesitate to give you a precise split which may. them be subject to small changes before the 11th of March.. On the prudency question side, if I heard your question correctly, you're right that we are. coming from a 71% and now we are at the 2/3 IBNR situation, but that of course has to be. seen in seen in the context of significantly more activity from our seedubg companies, -their losses to us. When we look at that development there was no loss -- in Q2. We. started to see a little bit of a lot -- action from us seeding companies in Q3, but now with. the imminent 1st of January renewal there was much more activity from our seeding. companies making their case and presenting their losses to us. So that number has. increased significantly during the fourth quarter.. So therefore, I would say, the 65% we are going to report with a full year number comes. from a much more solid base and it comes to underlying information from our seeding. companies. So therefore, the level of prudency even though the percentage number has. gone down should actually be up given the underlying quality of the information we have. from our seeding companies. And on the retrocessional question again, hoping that I. heart your question correctly, you will understand that given what I said initially about the. business mix of our COVID-19 EUR950 million reserve, I'm also hesitating to give you a. precise number now, but you will certainly see that on the 11th of March.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you, Sven, and sorry for the voice quality. Thank you very much. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. No problem. Thank you.. Operator. And there are currently no further questions. I hand back to the speaker for closing. remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much for joining everyone, and I hope this session was informative. and gave you valuable insight and background on the renewals. We wanted to convey the. message that we're satisfied with the renewal round. It's an orderly renewal as I said and. some continued momentum which we will see further down the year, but also in '22.. COVID reserving is adding a level prudency and we wanted to take a longer-term view, so. that we can protect our performance in 2021.. Therefore, we're confirming the guidance for '21 and feel comfortable that we'll make it.. We see momentum on the business side, we see rates continuing to improve in P&C, we. see some growth opportunities in various segments particularly in non-traditional. business, life and non-life, and therefore, the outlook for '21 is positive, but also for '22, I. think the momentum is a multi-year development. So that, these are key messages, as. we said, a number of times some of the answers to your questions will be clarified on the. 11th of March. So thanks for your patience on this. But we'll deliver some full-year. information and more granularity as we have our next conference call. So thank you all for. joining, and talk to you at the latest on March the 11th. Thank you.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect.",20210204_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_M-A_Call_2021-2-4_RT000000002949284264.pdf,2021-02-04
8,"Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call. presenting the results for the first half year of 2018. As always, I'm joined by our CFO,. Roland Vogel.. Our business developed rather favorable in the first half year of 2018, driven by a. significantly improved underwriting result. Our EBIT grew by 13.5% to EUR 907 million. The. EBIT, therefore, grew even faster than our premium income, which increased by 11%.. Foreign exchange rate adjusted, the increase for this (it) have been 18%, predominantly. stemming from our P&C business. Due to some one-off negative tax effects, the tax ratio. for the half year increased to 31.4%. And thus, the net income only increased by 3.8% to. $555 million (sic) (EUR 555 million). The tax effect mentioned mainly refers to the. restructuring of our U.S. life business following the U.S. tax reform, which became effective. towards the end of last year. This effect was already recorded in respect of our Life &. Health business in the First Quarter.. The book value per share decreased slightly as a result of the dividend payment in the. Second Quarter. This is in line with our capital management goal to manage the growth of. our IFRS capital by payment of special dividends. We can do this because of our very. comfortable Solvency II ratio, which stands at 256% at the end of the Second Quarter. And. therefore remains significantly above our 200% threshold, which we want to maintain in. line with our risk appetite. It is expected that this number will remain largely stable at the. end of the Second Quarter.. Our return on equity increased to 13.2% and is well above our minimum target of 900. basis points above the risk-free rate. Our P&C reinsurance business saw a significant. increase in the underwriting result based on an improved combined ratio compared to. the first half year of 2017 and continued strong premium growth. The large losses in the. first half year were well below the expected levels, however, due to our conservative. unchanged reserving policy. This is largely not reflected in our underwriting result.. On our Life & Health business, we saw a significant improvement in the results of our. legacy U.S. mortality business. But the results remain negative on that business. The. losses were less than half of those we saw in the first half year of 2017 and came in well. below expectations. As a result of the significant reduced loss burden from that business,. the underlying profitability of our Life & Health business became more visible. And. therefore, the EBIT increased by 32.8% to EUR 290 million.. The premium grew -- the premiums grew adjusted for foreign exchange rate movement. by 3.7%, in line with our targets as put down in our target matrix. The performance of our. investment continued to exceed our target of more than 2.7%. Based on a stable ordinary. investment income, the return on investment from assets under own management were. 3.1% on an annualized basis.. On this note, I would like to hand over to Roland, who will explain these figures to you in. more detail.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Good morning. And thank you, Uli. Maybe one short remark before I start. For those. interested in analyzing our reserve situation in even more detail, we have published the. P&C loss reserve triangles as of December 2017 on our website today.. Here on the second slide, you see that the remarkable growth of 18.1% adjusted for. currency exchange rates in the first half year of 2018 is largely driven by our P&C business,. as we continued to see ongoing high demand from our clients. Net premium earned. developed overall in line with the gross premium. And here, looking at the underlying. details, the change in unearned premium had a dampening effect on the earned. premium, which is natural in a growth environment, whereas the retention increased. slightly compared to the previous year.. Other income and expenses decreased mainly due to lower positive currency effects. The. increase in group net income was a little bit less pronounced, Uli mentioned that already,. compared to the rise in EBIT, reflecting a higher tax rate. This is mainly the result of the. extraordinary tax burden in connection with the U.S. tax reform and the necessary. restructuring of our internal repossessions of our U.S. Life & Health business in the First. Quarter. Moreover, we had a few smaller effects, which we do not expect to repeat. themselves in the second half of the year so that our expectation for the full year is a tax. ratio below 30% again.. On the next slide, the operating cash flow continued to be very positive in the first half. year, increasing by more than 10% compared to the previous years. Besides this and not. part of the operating cash flow, we issued our first senior bond to the volume of EUR 750. million in the Second Quarter of 2018 and experienced some currency movements, in. particular, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, which had a positive effect. of around EUR 800 million. Altogether, this was partially mitigated by a decrease in. variation reserve of almost EUR 500 million and the payout of last year's dividend so that. the overall assets under own management increase was only slightly -- or the increase. was only a slight decrease by 2.1%.. Looking at the capital position. We see the same effects with the dividend payment, is, to. a large extent, covered by the profits from the first half year of 2018. Rising interest rates,. especially in the U.S. dollar, resulted in a decrease in unrealized gains on the other hand.. And positive currency effects on the other abate to a lesser extent. Therefore, the overall. negative development of the OCI led to a decrease in shareholders' equity of 2.4%.. Here, on the left-hand side of this slide, you can see that the newly-issued senior bond. did not change the hybrid bucket. And we still have an unchanged high degree of. flexibility in this regard to manage our capital.. On the next slide, the P&C gross written premium increased by a remarkable 27.6% on an. FX-adjusted basis. The main driver for this growth continues to be new business written. on our structured reinsurance team. Additionally, a few larger transactions in our traditional. business lines contributed as well to this development, especially here in Australia and. China.. Asset retention increased by 2percentage points. The gross net premium earned was. slightly higher compared to the gross premium.. Major losses in the first half year were significantly below budget. As in previous years, we. stuck to our reserving practice and kept a large loss expectation as part of our IBNR. reserves. Nevertheless, a combined ratio of 95.7% is below the full year's maximum of. 96%. Looking at the underwriting results, it's gratifying to see that the increase of 46.5%. clearly outperforms the high premium growth, which is even more impressive in light of. the competitive market environment.. As always, the underwriting results here includes the funds withheld. In this context, it's. worth mentioning that the interest from funds withheld this time actually contributed. some EUR 16 million, which also reflects the increase in structured transactions and was. not so material in the recent past.. The run-off of loss reserves in the first half year was in line with our expectations. And as. we have not changed our approach to setting the initial loss reserves, we do not expect. material changes to the confidence level.. Ordinary investment income was stable. Other income and expenses decreased, mainly. because of the very positive currency effects seen last year, which did not recur at -- to. the same extent this year.. The operating profit increased by 8.6% compared to a slight decrease in net income. The. higher tax ratio was mainly due to the fact that last year benefited from tax-reduced. disposals, gains and dividends. As already mentioned, a few small items accumulated. But. we expect the tax ratio to come down for the full year as mentioned earlier.. On the next slide, major losses were significantly below the expected level and even. lower than the already benign first half year of 2017. This leaves us with a comfortable. cushion of around EUR 730 million to absorb large losses in the remainder of the year,. including the unused nearly EUR 260 million carried forward from the first half year. That. said, I think the loss development in the second half of 2017 was a strong reminder for us. of what can happen in reinsurance.. The large loss list on the next slide is rather short after the first half of 2018, with Storm. Friederike being the costliest event for our book. Normally, this reporting is focused on. losses occurring in the current period given that the development of the Harvey, Irma and. Maria losses is a bit of a hot topic of the recent past. I would add that Hannover Re. experienced a slight increase in the HIM losses on a gross basis in the Second Quarter.. However, in U.S., the fact that Irma and Maria are covered by our whole account. protection, our net position was not materially affected at all.. Moreover, there had been discussions around the loss from a Colombian dam. Here, we. expect a low double-digit million impact if the loss makes it to the large loss list at all.. On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed healthy underwriting. profitability. Several regions and lines contributed strong to the underwriting reserve here,. namely Continental Europe, marine, credit and surety. And actually all 3 lines within our. global reinsurance segment.. North America was impacted by a negative -- one negative reserve development from. some of the previous years here, especially the California wildfires developed a little bit. negatively. Within the U.K. business, we expanded our nonproportional motor business,. which comes in with very high initial loss ratio assumptions. So we are not that much. concerned here from those results.. On Slide #9, in Life & Health, the gross written premium increased by 3.7% adjusted for FX. effects, which is fully in line with our expectations for the entire year. The main driver for. this development was our U.K. longevity business.. Uli already commented on the development in U.S. mortality. And I think he will come back. to that as part of his outlook. Also, outside the U.S. mortality, the business development. was favorable. Our morbidity business performed particularly well, with significantly. improved profitability compared to the previous years. Our U.S. financial solutions. business continues to deliver excellent results. This is also visible in the other income and. expense line where the profits from treaties which are accounted or according to deposit. accounting are recognized.. Ordinary investment income was stable, realized gains and losses lower as compared to. last year, partly driven by the increase in interest rates in the U.S. and our current portfolio. restructuring. Consequently, net income from assets under own management decreased. to EUR 142 million.. As already mentioned, we had a one-off effect of around EUR 22 million from the U.S. tax - or negative EUR 22 million from the U.S. tax reform already in Q1 2018. This effect will not. go away over the course of the year. But of course, also not repeat itself. But as a one-off,. the impact should be diluted. This is already visible in the tax rate for the first six months.. Looking at the investments. The development in the first six months of 2018 was very. satisfactory, with investment income remarkably above the return expectations for the full. year. In light of the strong contribution from private equity and real estate, the ordinary. investment income remained stable despite the fact that we sold our listed equity. portfolio last year and therefore, did not benefit from the dividend season this year.. Realized gains and losses decreased compared to last year. This development reflects. the fact that as part of the portfolio restructuring activities owing to the steeper yield. curve, we realized also some losses, particularly in the Second Quarter.. Impairments and depreciations still consist mainly of regular depreciation for real estate.. Overall, the ROI of 3.1% makes us very confident of achieving the full year's target of at. least 2.7%.. As a result of increased interest rates and widened spreads, the valuation reserve. decreased as compares to year-end 2017. Although on the other hand, this is associated. with a higher reinvestment yield.. The next slide shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes contributed to. the investment income compared to where we are invested. In course of our -- or in the. course of our portfolio restructuring, we have reduced our share of non-investment-grade. profits. And on the other hand, have increased the portion of government bonds.. Additionally, we have modified the nature of our government bond holdings and. expanded our portfolio of instrument with inflation-linked coupons and redemption. amounts to counteract potentially rising inflation risks.. The left-hand side illustrates the favorable performance of our private equity and real. estate portfolio. The contribution from government bonds is increasing compared to the. previous periods, driven by a mix of higher volumes and increasing interest rates,. especially in the U.S.. I think this concludes my remarks. And as usual, I'll leave the target matrix and the outlook. to you, Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. The target matrix reflects good performance of our business in the. first half year, with almost all targets being reached. This is particularly gratifying as the. first half year 2017 also had shown results which were largely in line with our targets.. The renewal of our traditional property/casualty business during the Second Quarter went. quite well for us. The market conditions remained quite competitive. However, in line with. the renewals at 1st of January and during the First Quarter, we saw overall modest. improvement of the pricing quality of the business.. In particular, for those programs that were hit by losses in 2017 due to the hurricanes in. the Caribbean and North America, rate increases could be achieved. In the Caribbean,. these were rather significant, ranging from about 10% to 40%. But in North America, even. on loss-affected business, rate increases were largely contained to single-digit. percentages. This was particularly true for the natural catastrophe business in Florida,. which renewed at June 1. Due to abundant capacity, in particular, also from the ILS. markets, the increases here were rather modest despite the fact that the Hurricane Irma. losses in Florida continued to rise. Based on those market conditions, we were able to. grow our business in North America by 15%. We, however, continued our rather cautious. approach to the Floridian business.. Besides the North American business at 1/7, significant portions of our Australian business. renewed as well as business in Latin America. In both areas, we were able to achieve. meaningful growth at improved terms compared to last year. Overall, our premium grew. by 16% to just over EUR 1.5 billion.. Based on the highly diversified portfolio, we expect for 2018 to achieve an overall. profitability above the cost of capital. We also expect double-digit growth of our premium. income. This is true for most parts of our portfolio. But we see particular positive. developments of our North American, Continental Europe. And credit and surety business.. Also, of course, our structured reinsurance business continues to grow, with results in line. with expectations.. In respect of our Life & Health business, Roland already commented on the excellent. results of our financial solution business, which we expect to continue for the entire year.. In addition, our growing mobility business, in particular from Asia and the Middle East,. shows clearly improved results, which should comfortably satisfy the cost of capital.. Particular in the U.K., the longevity business is becoming increasingly competitive, which is. clearly eating into the margins. This means that our volume on this business will remain. rather stable and driven by the in-force book.. On our mortality business, we expect a significant negative development in the second. half of 2018 from our U.S. legacy mortality business from the United States. Due to the. continued negative results of this business, which we had acquired in a large block. transaction (SRA procession) at the beginning of 2009, we have exercised our rights to. increase the reinsurance rate.. The announcement to our clients happened with a letter of May 1, which means that most. of the rate increases will become effected at the beginning of August. As a result of the. rate increases, the ceding companies have the option to either implement the rate. increases or recapture the business. This resulted in significant recapture effective. beginning of August, which in turn has already resulted in a negative impact on our IFRS. results in the Third Quarter to the tune of USD 264 million.. As we have not heard back from all of our ceding companies, we have to expect that this. number will further increase during the second half year, which may reduce the EBIT from. our Life & Health business below the anticipated around EUR 200 million. At the same. time, we consider these recaptures to be positive because, in each and every case, they. mean that future losses from our U.S. legacy mortality business will reduce so that the. result of our Life & Health business from 2019 onwards will improve.. We have left our guidance largely unchanged, except we have increased the dividend. payout ratio to 35% to 45% of our group IFRS net income from the previous 35% to 40%.. This should allow us to increase the regular dividend and is a reflection of our comfortable. Solvency II ratio.. Based on the information available at this point in time, we would expect to pay a. dividend for 2018 at least at the level of last year, which was EUR 5. This would again. include a special dividend and would not be dependent on the level of recaptures on our. legacy U.S. mortality business, which we may see in the second half year.. Our guidance for premium growth as well as for the investment returns remain. unchanged. The development during the first six months suggests that these targets. should be achievable. We also confirm our net income guidance of more than EUR 1 billion.. We are confident to achieve this as long as the large losses remain within the budget and. there is no dislocation on the capital market. This confirmation of our group net income. guidance takes into account the expected recaptures from our U.S. legacy mortality. business, which I already said are expected to grow above the level of EUR 264 million -sorry, U.S. dollars currently advised.. This slide gives you the rationale for our short; and midterm outlook of our business. I. would particularly highlight our expectation that the IFRS profits of our Life & Health. business should increase from 2019 onwards as we see the underlying profitability of this. business currently at an EBIT above EUR 400 million.. On this note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation. And I look. forward to your questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And the first questions are from the line of Jonathan Urwin at UBS.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. Just 2 from me. So in life, what can we expect from the underlying performance. improvement from these recaptures? I think they're a bit higher than we were thinking,. certainly. Is the main impact just lower volatility going forward? So will we see higher. normalized earnings as well? Then secondly, on the dividends, on the increase in the. ordinary payout ratio guidance today, I guess, are you signaling a higher total dividend per. share potential, including special? It doesn't sound like you are. Or are you signaling that. the ordinary dividend component will just make up a larger piece of the pie?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, the recapture that we have seen are a little bit higher than expected, I must. say. But it also shows that the problem area of our legacy U.S. mortality business, we are. now able to come to a solution with -- on that. This clearly improves the earnings in 2019. and onwards and just not reduces the volatility. It's a clear improvement in the earnings.. Of course, I mean, every losses we take due to the resolution of the negative reserves. that we have on that business, it's already an improvement of future earnings because we. take the losses forward. At the same time, of course, also the future expected losses. decrease to an even higher amount. So this is an additional effect of future profitability of. our business because, I mean, the burden of the losses from the legacy U.S. mortality. business, which have decreased quite significantly. As far as the dividends is concerned, at. this time of the year, of course, we can say that we would pay, provided everything's. being equal, a similar dividend than we had paid last year, which would then, of course,. mean that the ordinary portion would increase. I mean, considerations of higher dividends,. we will, of course, have to wait until year-end when we have a clear picture of the result of. the entire year. This is in line which -- with the way we normally look at our dividend. payments.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. Just a quick follow-up on life -- on the life side. So you mentioned at the end of your. prepared remarks that it was EUR 400 million is the current underlying view of life EBIT. Is. that correct?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. It's more than EUR 400 million.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. More than EUR 400 million.. Ulrich Wallin. I mean, if you exclude the negative effects from the legacy mortality business in the U.S., it. is actually currently. But I have to say that the first half year went quite well. It's quite a bit. more than EUR 400 million.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. Quite a bit more, okay.. Operator. We are now over to the line of William Hawkins at KBW.. William Hawkins. Uli, I think you said clearly at the end that your guidance of north of EUR 1 billion profits. was good, regardless of the outcome of the U.S. mortality. Given that there's still a pretty. wide range of a few hundred million, what exactly is the balancing item that's enabling you. to be confident regardless of that outcome? That's my number one. Question number. two, can you give us an indication of roughly how many contracts have generated the. $264 million and roughly how many more there are to go? I'm not sure if you know. So just. the concentration risk between contracts, how that's spread? Then lastly just very briefly,. can you just indicate what is currently your binding constraint to any capital distribution. decision you might make?. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, William, for the questions. Yes. The guidance on the U.S. mortality, the. guidance of more than EUR 1 billion is regardless of the losses from the legacy U.S.. mortality business. What is the balancing item? I mean, we have continued to buffer on. our P&C loss reserves. And I mean, we can now say that this currency adjusted has not. shrunk to -- during 2017. So we feel quite comfortably in that respect. We also have to. consider that in the run-up to IFRS 17, we have to revisit these redundancies anyhow. Then,. I mean, how much the $264 million, how much of the portfolio have been reflected in. that? Well I mean, the number of treaties overall is, I think, close to 1,000 treaties.. However, I mean, it's, of course, only about 100, I mean, groups of ceding companies that. are factored here. And I would say, I mean, the conclusion on that we have seen up to. now is around, I would say, 40% of the portfolio by net amount at risk. That should -might be a pretty good guidance. Then the last question, can you remind me?. William Hawkins. Binding constraints on capital distribution.. Ulrich Wallin. Not that much because our -- I mean, German GAAP figures are developing quite. favorably. It's just, of course, that we, as in the past, are interested in an attractive. dividend in a given year but also concerned that we want to pay a constant dividend. regardless the volatility that, I mean, a reinsurance company may see because, I mean,. we are in the risk-taking business, which can be quite volatile.. William Hawkins. Ulrich Wallin. Not really. I mean, we have -- of course, there has been a tightening in the capital model. of S&P. But they just had confirmed our AA; rating. We are still, I mean, in a comfortable. situation there from our current, I mean, ratio according to their model but also due to the. fact that we have, I mean, a very comfortable unused hybrid bucket.. Operator. Our next question's over the line of Kamran Hossain of RBC Capital Markets.. Kamran Hossain. Sorry to stick on this topic of life. But I guess, in relation to the recaptures, could you just. talk us through the time line? Because the way I understand it, the notification period. hasn't been -- I guess, price increase has gone through. It hasn't been a particularly long. period so far in the uptakes. It feels like it's a little bit higher than you'd anticipated. So any. kind of comments around time line kind of when you started officially that process? Kind. of how long do people have to take any decisions relating to that? And the second. question, just on the U.S. legacy losses, could you just give us a number year-to-date? I'm. not sure if I missed it early.. Ulrich Wallin. Well you didn't miss that number because I didn't tell it. But I mean, the year-to-date. number is around $40 million negative. But that is -- I mean, we expect it according to. what we call the reboot assessment just to be more like $100 million. So I mean, we have. clearly better performance there, despite the fact that the performance is not in line with. what we had anticipated at -- when we bought that big block of business. And those, of. course, are the locked-in reserves. And of course, the locked -- the reserves remain. locked in because our U.S. mortality continues to have, I mean, a positive value in force.. That positive value in force actually increases with every recapture charge because the. recapture charge brings the loss into the IFRS profit and loss account. And therefore, in. the loss recognition testing, it's out. And therefore, the sufficiency there is actually. increasing. Time line, yes, very interesting question. I mean, the time or the period that. people have to notify us is basically 90 days. I mean, there are some extensions that we. have granted for another month. But it's largely 90 days. And that is the reason why right. when we compiled our accounts, all these recapture notices were coming in. We also. have some notices that people implement the rate increases. Then, of course, I mean,. there's another 60 days, for the most part, for the client that haven't responded to. implement the rate increases. So I mean, we expect that we see most of the issues. regarding the rate increases and recapture being finalized within the Third Quarter. Some. might, I mean, drag on into the Fourth Quarter. Then, of course, I should also say that. clients also have the ability to challenge us on the rate increases. Then, we would go into. arbitration. That will, of course, take longer. However, our legal advisers tell us that the. arbitrations that have been happening in the past on these issues have almost always. been won by the reinsurers. That's as far as the time line. I think that pretty much answers. your question, does it?. Operator. Okay. We're now over to the line of Paris Hadjiantonis at CrÃ©dit Suisse.. Paris Hadjiantonis. talking about an impact of $264 million so far. I'm not completely clear if that already gives. you an EBIT of EUR 400 million. You've talked about underlying EBIT of EUR 400 million. right now. But would that take you to the EUR 400 million from 2019 onwards? And if yes,. what does any incremental, any additional recaptures do that EUR 400 million going. forward? So what happens, for example, if that $264 million goes up to $500 million in. terms of upfront recaptures in Q3 and Q4? The second question will be on the. investment result. You have a return on investment of 3.1%. You're still guiding for 2.7% or. above, which, to an extent, implies a lot of conservatism or maybe a large one-off in H2.. Which of the 2 is it? And if you could actually give us your new money yield currently, that. would also be helpful.. Ulrich Wallin. I would leave the second question to Roland because he knows that much better than. me. Regarding the $264 million recapture, that was not yet sufficient for the expected -- I. mean, all other things being equal, for the expected about EUR 400 million of EBIT.. However, if we would have recaptured $500 million, then, of course, the majority of the. business that is subject to rate increases would have been recaptured. That would, of. course, then mean that the EUR 400 million should definitely be within reach.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Okay. And with regards to the investment income, yes, you're right. The current. achievement is remarkably above the guidance. But the guidance has at least 2.7%. When. we go into the year, we usually look at the ordinary income and leave out the rest. We. have said the disposal gains have come down a bit. But we are still well in line. But it was. not a reason for us to change the guidance. So if you ask me if I would be very surprised if. we still have the 3 as the first digit by the end of the year, I think that is possible. We don't. expect anything extraordinary to happen. Still, it will be depending on some realized gains. in -- for the rest -- for the remainder of the year as well. With regard to the reinvestment. yield, you know that we usually communicate that on a -- on the basis that we sell. think the reinvestment yield should be between 2.1%, 2.2%. If we then would include the. change or an adjustment of the investments which we invest in, that could increase slightly. two years ago.. Our next question is over the line of Vinit Malhotra at Mediobanca.. One on Life Re. One on P&C. On Life Re, one thing I'm curious is, is this -- I mean, is -- the. very strong mortality on the legacy side. And you said it's half the result of what you would. have expected and then how bad it is. So is it the right thing to do to cancel all these. treaties if they are performing very well now? And is that the reason why suddenly there's. such a high takeup of this recapture? That's the first question. The second question is just. on the P&C re growth, which obviously is very high in the 1H. But in 2Q, was slightly lower, I. think maybe 17% compared to 39% in 1Q. Of course, they're lumpy, structured, tailor. made, et cetera. But is that meant to taper off a bit at this one point? And the other. question linked to that is that when you sold equities, the idea was to put money to work. in the reinsurance market, where pricing hasn't happened. But is -- are these structured. products actually consuming capital? And if not, then what do you plan to do with that EUR. 400 million on the balance sheet?. Ulrich Wallin. Well on license held, of course, we were relatively pleased to see some better mortality. on our U.S. life legacy. But first of all, that doesn't mean that the business has turned into. profitable -- into profitability; and secondly, it's only 2 quarters. And I mean, it's a better. trend, I would say, than we had seen in 2017. So we take it. But we still -- I mean, we would. still, of course, find it's the best solution for our clients that implement the rate increases.. But if they decide to recapture, that's fine. I mean, that also might indicate that they are. probably, in some cases, able to replace the business with one of our friendly competitors. at a lower rate than we have adjusted. I mean, for us, the big question here is really the. probably a little bit more pessimistic than what the market sees here overall. That's the. reason why -- I mean, we are happy if these treaties get resolved either with. implementing rate increases or, if that's not possible, with a recapture. On P&C growth,. yes, you're right. In the Second Quarter, it was tempering off a little bit. One of the. reasons is that the structured reinsurance deals, as they are capital relief, a little bit more. concentrated on 1/1 and there are less renewals midterm. And therefore, we saw this. slight tapering off. We don't expect to see further tapering off through the -- towards the. second half. I mean, one is, of course, the 1/7 renewal that we saw new premiums coming. in at growth of 16%. Also, that should normally force -- I mean, between the cracks of. reporting is the growth in our agricultural business to the tune of about EUR 100 million.. And the reason for that is that it's mostly 1/4 renewals, some 1/1 renewals. But the treaties. are finalized then within the Second Quarter. So they have missed the reporting of the. First Quarter. And if they are First Quarter, they're also missing the reporting of the. Second Quarter. So with these effects, I mean, we are quite confident that we will have a. very good growth on our P&C business for the overall year of 2017. Yes, I mean, applying. capital to underwriting and then the rates haven't risen as much as they should have done.. There are some truth in that. But as you see, I mean, we find in this current market. environment, also due to our low expense ratio, admin expense ratio, I mean, sufficient. opportunities on the P&C side to employ our capital. From that point of view, yes, I mean,. it's not quite as good as it should have been. But it's still all right, I would say.. Vinit Malhotra. Can I follow up with you on this EUR 400 million? Because this is not the first time we've. heard this number. I mean, there was a question, I think, in the full year results call when. you had said that you can't be sure of EUR 400 million in '19. But maybe afterwards,. because '17 wasn't very good. I'm talking about Life Re EBIT. Could you clarify, when you. said it should be over EUR 400 million, you did say not '19. But did you mean somewhere. in '20 or some medium term or some later?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, if all the treaties where we have applied the rate increases get resolved in. 2018, then the EUR 400 million for '19 would be quite plausible. I mean, of course, if the. treaties continue to be on our books, then the big question is, of course, have we seen. the peak in the mortality losses in 2017 and the trend is back to a more, say, the 5-year. average, then, of course, it would be fine. But of course, that's rather difficult to say. I. mean, if that's the peak or if we see a further deterioration of the losses, to some extent,. this depends on the mortality improvements, depends on all the losses that are so much. discussed with the (inaudible) the U.S., which might have an effect there. So I mean, as I. think we mentioned in previous calls, the problem with our book is that we have a. concentration on the older underwriting here. So the average age of the insured is higher.. And therefore, this business is more subject to the fluctuations in the old age mortality.. That's really not visible on the new underwriting years.. Operator. We now go to Sami Taipalus of Goldman Sachs.. Sami Taipalus. So my first question, just coming back to the Life & Health reinsurance business. It's really - it's only Solvency II impact from the sort of recaptures that you're doing? Then my. second question is on IFRS 17. You commented about the change or potential change to. the reserves. Could you just add a little bit more color there? I guess, we're moving from. a regime, which is a prudent-based regime without discounting to one where you're. going to have a best estimate or discounting best estimate liabilities with a risk. adjustment. So how should we see that change playing out over the next couple of years?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I didn't quite catch your first question on the recapture. What did you want to. (inaudible)?. Sami Taipalus. Yes. I was just wondering if -- I was wondering if there's any impact on the Solvency II. numbers from these recaptures.. Ulrich Wallin. On the Solvency II numbers, it was -- on the Solvency II numbers, the impact is rather. limited because the higher-than-expected mortality is, of course, in the technical -- in the. Solvency II technical provisions because, on Solvency II, of course, we haven't got a lock-in.. Sami Taipalus. The sentiments you've been getting have been in line with sort of the assumptions that. Ulrich Wallin. Oh, yes, absolutely. And on IFRS 17, I would hand over to Roland because he's the expert. in that.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes, Sami. I think to -- this is, of course, a hot topic. And we are all -- we are trying -- in the. middle of doing our analysis of our first simulations and whatever. You mentioned that we. are going from a prudent to a best estimate, which I don't see exactly because we are in. the best estimate environment and everything we have here is part of our best estimate. ranges, which -- where you can see the result. Of course, we will see how this cash flow. based accounting will really end up. Also, here, we might have possibilities to look at cash. flows, to look at -- you mentioned risk margins, the CSM, the potentially different borders.. So where there are options, we would, of course, try to maintain what we feel is the right. approach and has been the right approach. It might also be affected to some extent. But. it's very, very difficult to say that already today as we are, again, in the middle of the first. quantitative analysis in that regard. Plus, we have to be aware that the respective bodies. are still discussing. There is a EFRAG statement. There had been approaches to the IASB.. And there are still different discussions a little bit up in the air, the different definition of. the unit of account. So there are lots of technicality -- technicalities to be sorted out,. especially in practice. And again, we feel that what we do today makes a lot of sense. And. if possible, we will try to maintain that.. Ulrich Wallin. And I would say that IFRS 17, in the finer details, it's still a little bit a moving target.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes.. Operator. We now go to Guilhem Horvath at Exane BNP Paribas.. Guilhem Horvath. The first question is on P&C re combined ratio. I'm a bit surprised to see the mix between. the loss ratio and the expense ratio this quarter because usually when you write. structured reinsurance, the loss ratio is higher and the expense ratio is substantially. different. But this time, you have a quite high expense ratio and a quite low loss ratio. So I. would like you to elaborate a little bit on this breakdown. And the second question is a bit. -- is a follow-up on the life topics. And it's just for checking purpose. I mean, it looks like. you're quite confident in 2019. Maybe you weren't in the past. Are you completely. confident that these issues and all the recapture process will be finished at the end of. 2018? Or is there any chance that you have further issues with this business going. forward?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, regarding the P&C combined ratio between -- the mix between loss ratio and. expense ratio, I mean, on the fact that reinsurance business on some of the larger. transactions, the loss ratio has actually come in better than expected due to the structure. of these treaties. That would then increase the commission ratio. That is one of the. effects, which is relatively gratifying because it, of course, has an even better buffer on. the expected margin of that business. The other thing is that also the mix of our business. is moving a little bit towards the proportional side. Life, the non-proportional business is. growing at a lower pace. This partly has to do with the demand of our clients. There is. more demand for proportional and less for nonproportional. It's not that much to our liking. commissions, of course, are a lot higher than on excess of the loss business. I mean, it's. not that much to our liking. But there's not a lot we can do about it because we clearly. prefer the nonproportional business to the proportional. But of course, I mean, we have. to serve the clients according to their needs. That's the thing on the loss ratio and the. combined ratio. Confidence on the life, I mean, I would say the problem should be largely. solved within 2018. Of course, I mean, if there are more recaptures than implementations,. the further development of the old age mortality would be less -- I mean, a source of. volatility. But of course, inevitably, we expect that there will be 1 or 2 arbitrations at the. end of 2019, which may then -- I mean, that normally takes 2.5 years. So that will still mean. that there will be some uncertainty. But the majority of the portfolio will be sorted out.. Operator. We now go to the line of Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays.. Ivan Bokhmat. I've got a question on the reserving side. You mentioned that, that was all in line with. expectations for the Second Quarter. I have a question, perhaps a bit broader in scope.. For the structured reinsurance business that you write, is it the same reserving approach?. Or considering that it's a higher combined ratio business, the margin is a little bit smaller. and therefore, we should expect smaller releases in the future? Then second perhaps on. the -- also in the P&C, could you comment why your earnout pattern was a little bit. different for the first half, why the earned premiums grew faster? And what should we. expect in the future?. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. I would then take the question on the reserving approach on the structured. reinsurance business. It's actually somewhat different to what we see in the P&C side. It's. also relatively conservative because the way we account for the margins is that we defer. the margin recognition as we would normally have a margin recognition reserve. And the. other thing also is that we only, I mean, earn the full margin that is in the treaty once the. treaty is finalized. That's largely then once the underwriting year is commuted. So I mean,. the conservatism on the structured reinsurance is more that we recognize the margins. later. But of course, the overall amount of conservatism as percentage of the premiums. there is less because also the volatility of the results are significantly less. And on the. earnout pattern, I would defer to you, Roland, because I think it's a really difficult question.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes. Thank you. I must admit we haven't really analyzed that. The -- of course, if you grow. remarkably, especially with proportional business at the beginning of the year, a lot of. what you had underwritten and what you see as a gross premium written will be reserved. and then reduces the earned. The earnings pattern differ to some extent line by line in. that there was no change whatsoever. And in that regard it is -- if you have observed a. change in earnings pattern, that must be really driven by the lines of business. Other than. that, I'd say we have not changed anything here. And of course, in a growth environment,. you always see the unearned portion growing as well.. Operator. Our next question is over the line of Thomas Fossard at HSBC.. Thomas Fossard. Two additional questions remaining on the life side. First one will be on what you've got at. the present time in terms of reprice from your client base. Are you able to say how much. of the amount at risk are coming as recapture, how much you believe actually clients will. opt for price increases? And how much is going for arbitration? So kind of speak in the. terms of feedback you've been getting from clients so far. Or potentially, what are your. expectations by the end of the year? And the second questions would be related to that.. The (100) clients, which have decided to recapture the business, how are you confident. that you can keep forward the new -- the commercial relation when it comes to securing. new business on new treaties?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, firstly on the mix between recapture and implementation and arbitration. Of. course, we haven't got any notice of arbitration so far. From the notices we have got, I. would say it's around a little bit more than 80% that have decided to recapture. And the. remainder has implemented. It's really difficult to say how that will turn out. But I will give. you a very precise answer on that at the end of the Third Quarter. The actual -- sorry.. Thomas Fossard. And the 80-20 is on 40%.... Ulrich Wallin. Off the net amount of (IFRS).. Thomas Fossard. Off the net amount of (IFRS). Okay. So you're still waiting for the 60% to come in the. coming weeks?. Ulrich Wallin. That's right. That's right. Then, I mean, the future commercial relationship, I mean, we still. continue with those clients' future business, particularly on the financial solutions side.. However, I mean, on the mortality solutions new business, we have changed our pricing. because, I mean, we have a higher pricing on the, I mean, old age. And this is really a little. bit higher than market pricing. So for the renewals, I mean, it's -- at this point in time, it's. basically more than 90% term business and very little, if any, permanent business, which is. like all of life business or universal life and business like that. So I mean, new business. production has been pretty strong. But due to the pricing actions that we took on the. mortality solutions business, it's actually coming down. Does that answer the question?. Thomas Fossard. Yes.. Operator. Our next question is over to the line of Frank Kopfinger at Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. I have 2 questions. My first question is on the outlook for P&C reinsurance. Can you. comment a little bit on your view on the market environment, especially as you're now. entering into the next negotiations? Monte Carlo and Baden-Baden are upcoming. And. then we are obviously entering into January renewals. Last time in January, you had a 1.4%. price increase. What would be your expectations for January given that we have a normal. development for the remainder of the year? Then secondly, just recently, a couple of. months ago, you launched a joint venture with your mother company at Talanx. And you. put together your specialty insurance initiatives with HDI. Is there any impact going. forward as you are obviously losing some business on the different -- within your. financials?. Ulrich Wallin. So as far as the P&C market outlook is concerned, considering that it's in the run-up to. Monte Carlo, I'm not going to prejudice my underwriters. I'm, of course, very optimistic. that we will see further increases. However, it's also fair to say that the market will. continue to be very competitive. I mean, there is still a lot of capacity. There is also an. increase in demand. We have seen that. And if you look at the development of the. premium volumes, say, of the 10 largest reinsurers or even more than that, all of them. report increased premiums. And that clearly signals an increase in demand. But I'm not. going to say that we will reduce prices. I mean, that's not the time to do that. But yes, it. will be -- it will definitely be competitive. I mean, the joint venture that we have on the. specialty business, from our side, it's really motivated that at Hannover Re, we want to be. a pure-play reinsurer. And I mean, the influence on the financials will not be that large. because also HDI Global is, of course, allocating some of their business to the specialty. company. And as -- I mean, that business is really not lost for us because the way the. specialty company works is that we get a quota share -- I mean, a guaranteed quota. share session on all of that business. And on all of that business, of course, means that it's. more than the business that we're currently writing into Hannover. So on that point of. view, I mean, the aim is, of course, to see an increased profitability. That's the aim for. both joint venture partners. I mean, we might see a little bit of an early drop in the. premium volume. But that will not be material. So overall, we think it's very positive. because it allows us to concentrate on the reinsurance business. And also on the specialty. business from HDI, we will also get that then as a reinsurance and not writing the. insurance directly.. Operator. Our next question is over the line of Andrew Ritchie at Autonomous.. Andrew James Ritchie. I just have one question. On your slide on renewals, the intriguing sentence, which says. casualty pricing is not fully reflecting the continued loss emergence, I mean, casualty -U.S. casualty has been an area where you've been trying to become more constructive. I. think you expect it to grow. So what are you referring to? Are you basically suggesting that. the pricing has been disappointing? Is the loss emergence on auto-related lines? Or is it. other lines?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, where we are growing on our casualty business, it's more with our mediumsized clients and it's more like standard business, like standard GL, lead umbrellas on SME. type business. So it's not the large account U.S. casualty. I mean, where we are concerned. and where we feel it's not fully reflected in the pricing is the developing inflation and the. probability of further inflation, which drives loss costs up. I mean, we clearly see that in the. commercial auto business. We also see it in parts of the D&O business. And we feel that. this is not completely reflected in the pricing. Therefore, we are quite cautious on our U.S.. casualty and where we grow. It's with existing clients on business that we already write.. Operator. Okay. We now go to the line of Roland PfÃ¤nder at ODDO BHF.. Roland Pf Ã¤nder. Two questions from my side. Do you expect any disposal gain out of the sale of Inter. Hannover to Talanx? And does this deal also have a Solvency II impact? And the second. question, I saw that you changed your profitability outlook on the facultative reinsurance. business in the Second Quarter. Maybe you could shed some light on this -- which. triggered the change.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, when it comes to -- we did -- we are not an IFRS. We haven't gotten a. disposal gain on the sale of Inter Hannover. The reason is that, I mean, we keep a good. part of the profit stream of that business through reinsurance. And Inter Hannover has. relatively low net retention anyhow. And that will also continue for the specialty business.. Of course, it's not third-party session. It's all in intra-group sessions there. Solvency II. impact is minimal on that. Facultative, I mean, we have changed that from a plus to a. plus/minus. We still expect to earn the cost of capital. But we have seen some increases in. the frequency of medium-sized losses particular on the property side and on the. engineering side. And therefore, our underwriters and managers have looked at this a. little bit more cautious.. Operator. Okay. Gentlemen, at this stage, there seem to be no further questions in the queue. Can I. please pass it back to you?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, certainly. Thank you very much. Thank you, all for phoning in and taking an interest in. our half year results. And I wish you all a very good and nice day. Thank you very much.",20180809_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2018-8-9_SD000000002876144587.pdf,2018-08-09
9,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Q1 2019 Results. For your information, this conference is being. recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich. Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to. our conference call presenting our results for the first quarter of 2019. As usual, I'm joined. by our CFO, Roland Vogel. Overall, the first quarter of 2019 marks a good start to the. year. The increased demand for reinsurance, as well as our good competitive position. within our markets allowed us to grow our portfolios both on the Property&Casualty, as. well as on the Life&Health side. Even more important, we were also able to grow the. bottom line, as the net income coming in at EUR294 million, 7.4% higher than the first. quarter of 2018, which already was quite a good quarter for us. This in fact marks the. 42nd consecutive profitable quarter -- quarterly result of Hannover Rueck, of which I had. the privilege to report to you the last 40 as CEO of the company. This is also the last. quarter I will report to you, as tomorrow after the finish of our AGM, Jean-Jacques. Henchoz will take over as my successor.. Due to the strong earnings and significant increased valuation reserve, the book value per. share increased by 12.2% to reach a new historical high of EUR81.6 million. Nevertheless,. we managed to keep the return on equity at 12.6% well above our minimum target, which. comes in at 9.4% being 900 basis points above the so-called risk-free rate. The Solvency. II ratio stood at 246% at the end of 2018 and should be somewhat higher at the end of. the first quarter. The result of our Property&Casualty business was again very strong. This. growth of the technical profit of 25% based on increased premiums for the tune of about. 20%.. Regarding our Life&Health business, we saw a significant increase of our profitability, as. the group net income increased by 73.2% to EUR89 million. This is in particular gratifying. because already the first quarter of last year was a good quarter to us and we could. report favorable results was better than expected results from our US mortality business.. This continued in the first quarter of 2019. However, we saw some weak performance of. our Australian disability business as a result of significantly deteriorating trading conditions.. On the other hand, our Financial Solutions business and here in particular those treaties. that are deposit accounted developed very favorable but resulted in a significant increase. of the contribution to the bottom line from the other income and expense line. Once. again, the income from investments developed above expectations, the ROI from assets. under own management coming in at 3% and thus exceeding our minimum target of. 2.8%.. On this note, I would like to hand over to Roland, who will explain these favorable figures. in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Yes, good morning and thank you, Wallin. I will try to keep my comments brief as the Q1. 2019 results do not include too many one-off effect worth commenting on. I would like to. take this opportunity also to point out that we have published our Solvency II so called. SFCR reports for the full-year 2018, adding a bit more detail to the Solvency ratios which. we have already published together with our year-end results. You will find them on the. company website. We have also put together one slide on the Solvency capital generation. in 2018 and have added it to the appendix of this slide deck.. On the next page, we see that we've continued to see very attractive top line growth in. the first quarter of 2019, adjusted for currency effects, gross written premium increased. by 16.1% driven by favorable business production in both business groups, but again with. pronounced contribution from P&C. Due to the change in unearned premium and a. slightly reduced retention in Life&Health, net premium growth was a little less dynamic.. However, I would expect this difference between gross and net premium to narrow down. until year-end because the change in unearned premium will naturally decrease, when we. earn it over the course of the year.. Other income expenses on a Group level increased mainly due to another increase from. deposit accounted Financial Solutions business and Life&Health. The tax rate is backed to. a normalized range, still it could have been even slightly better or slightly lower, but the. deterioration of typhoon Jebi to which we will come in a minute has hit especially our. Bermudan operation and led to a lower-than-expected contribution from the low tax. environment. The previous year's figures have been inflated by the one-time effect from. the US tax reform as you might remember. Altogether, Group net income increased by. 7.4% to EUR249 million -- EUR294 million, sorry.. On the next slide, the operating cash flow in the first quarter was particularly strong,. driven by attractive reinsurance growth, as well as pleasing results on the investmenttype. On top of this increasing valuation reserves and currency effect supported the. growth in assets by around EUR800 million and EUR650 million respectively, leading to a. record high level of assets under own management close to EUR45 billion.. Similar developments are also visible on the capital side, here on the next slide in addition. to the favorable earnings in the first quarter, the increase in OCI boosts the growth in. shareholders equity to 12.2%, largely driven by the valuation change due to the decreased. interest rates and lower credit spreads. On top of this, the EUR600 million change in. unrealized gains includes around EUR100 million resulting from a reorganization of the. shareholder structure of Viridium Gruppe, which became necessary in connection with the. acquisition of the Generali Leben, this will most likely lead to a reflection of the. appreciation of that value in the Q2 P&L. The composition of the total capital on the right. hand side of this slide here is unchanged with a high degree of flexibility around the. hybrid bucket, as we mentioned before.. On the next slide the P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 19.4% on an FX. adjusted basis, this is driven by both our structured reinsurance business and by. diversified growth in the traditional book. This is in line with the developments which we. have reported for the January 1st renewals. However, the growth rates in structured. reinsurance in particular should come down slightly over the course of the year, due to the. pattern of premium recognition for some of the larger treaties.. Net premium earned growth is a bit less pronounced because of the unowned parts as. well as growth in the ILS market, where our net retention as we all know was zero. A 2% of. net premium income -- major losses were remarkably below the already benign first. quarter of 2018. As in previous years, we stuck to our reserving practice and reflected the. large loss expectation as part of our IBNR reserves.. When it comes to the run-off profit, we've seen some negative developments from larger. losses in particular, typhoon Jebi for which we have increased our loss estimate by almost. EUR50 million based on a higher to market loss apart from this, the reserve development. in the first quarter was as always or as nearly always positive and still in a usual range. As. we have not changed our initial reserving approach, our current assumption is that the. confidence level of our P&C loss reserves has not changed compared to year-end 2018.. Altogether, it's gratifying to see the underwriting results, the result increased by more. than 25%, even stronger than the premium growth.. And at the combined ratio of 95.7% is clearly below the full-year maximum target of 97%.. Ordinary investment income was stable. Net investment income decreased due to a. lower contribution from realized gains, as the overall turnover in the portfolio was not. driven by huge capital transitions or not driven by the huge capital transitions we had last. year's resulting from the US tax reform.. Other income and expenses did not include any material one-offs altogether Group net. income of EUR235 million is down by 6.7% compared to a very good first quarter in the. previous year and also affected by a higher tax rate, which I had already mentioned. earlier. The operating result is almost stable,. As mentioned on the next slide major losses we're very benign adding up to EUR59. million in the first quarter. Therefore, the unused budget amounts to more than EUR100. million. The list of major losses in the first quarter is obviously comparatively short, along. with the two net cat events only one marine claim and the Ethiopian airline aviation claim. made it onto the large loss list. I might say that of course it is rather early to comment on. the Russian airline crash, but we don't expect it to be included on the large loss list.. On the next slide, we sorted our business group's down based on premium contribution,. as you can see numerous lines of business in regions contributed to the good under. writing result was combined ratios well below the maximum target. You might wonder why. the combined ratio for our structured reinsurance and ILS segment is at a very good. 95.2% after we had told you over the past years that this business line actually has an. inflating impact on the reported P&C combined ratio due to the low risk nature of the. business. The good profitability in the first quarter can be partly explained by the strong. contribution from the ILS component of this business line, in which we have seen. increased demand and successfully expanded our business volume. Additionally though,. structured reinsurance business, which is by far the larger component here reported. favorable profitability. The combined ratio effect of these two factors overall led to the. good result.. A few lines also exceeded the (inaudible) range, most notably UK, Ireland and London. market, as well as our cat business. The former was affected by a rather weak technical. profitability of the Lloyd's business that we support. Just to be clear, I'm not referring to. our subsidiary agenda, which is actually included in the facultative and direct line of. business, but our other Lloyd's activities. Furthermore, the combined ratio of our cats -our non-proportional cat business looks rather weak, despite me having told you that the. large loss experience was very benign. This is mainly driven by the development of the. Jebi loss, which is more or less fully captured within this business line. Overall, the. combined ratio of our highly diversified book is favorably below the target combined.. In Life&Health, gross written premium is up by 9.6% adjusted for the fixed effect, new. business production was particularly favorable in Asia and also in South America. The inforce management actions within our US mortality book in 2018 led to the expected. improvement in the result, even though the different compared to the previous years is. less visible in the technical result, because the underlying mortality was particularly good in. Q1 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 also included some smaller recapture losses, where. we capture effect of some 10 million.. The main reason for the decrease in the underwriting result is an underperformance of. our disability business in Australia, Ulrich had mentioned that already. And additionally,. other business was also slightly weaker overall then the strong 2018 first quarter without. any larger individual effects. Ordinary income increased compared to the previous years,. especially the fair value changes through P&L boosted the net investment income to. EUR104 million. Other expenses -- other income and expense is mainly driven by the. further improvement in the contribution from Financial Solutions business recognized. according to the deposit accounting method. EBIT increased nicely by 21.3%, clearly. outperforming the 5% growth target. Group net income increased even more strongly,. which is a result of the unfavorable tax ratio resulting from the US tax reform in the. previous year.. On slide -- on the next slide, the development of our investment in the first three months. of 2019 was very satisfactory. Return on investment of 3% is above our return expectation. for the full-year with increased ordinary investment income compared to the already good. figure in 2018. Realized gains decreased due to the lower portfolio turnover already. mentioned, consequently the realized gains are almost entirely driven by the sale of one. real estate property at very attractive pricing. This decline was offset by the change in fair. value of our financial instruments to which the ModCo derivative contributed EUR5.3. million.. Given that interest rates in our major currencies, decrease in credit spreads also trended. remarkably lower. The unrealized gains on our investments increased significantly. compared to year-end 2018 to reach a level of EUR1.8 billion, which means an increase of. around EUR800 million within only three months. It's always good to have such buffers as. we all know, but as we all know this automatically comes together with a decrease in. reinvestment yields and irrespective track on the future ordinary profit.. On the next slide, you can see that we did not change our asset allocation remarkably in. the first quarter, the overall diversified contribution to ordinary investment income is again. supported by the result from real estate and private equity, but not to any extraordinary. extent.. I think this concludes my remarks and as always, I'll leave the target makrix and the. outlook to you, I think Uli, the target matrix is nice to be presented this time.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland, yes, you're absolutely right. The target matrix shows that the numbers. of the first quarter of 2019 support all our mid-term target, to the extent applicable. This. confirms again that we had a good start into 2019. Coming to the renewal in the first. quarter, the traditional Property&Casualty treaty renewals from 2nd of January to 1st of. April of 2019 was later date being the most important, during that period pretty much. confirmed the trends that we had already seen, it's generally first renewals. This means. that loss effect of treaties saw meaningful increases, but loss reprograms overall they're. renewing largely flat, but benefiting to some extent from rate increases in the primary. market in many territories.. Overall, the rating level is above the comparable levels for 2017 and 2018, but is still. significantly below the levels we have enjoyed in 2015 and prior years. This is the result of. continued competitive markets, there are many market players seek to increase their. market share. At Hannover Rueck, we saw an increase of our premiums based on. unchanged exchange rate of 6.6% to EUR984 million. This was predominantly a result of. increased pricing, as we kept our share largely unchanged and to balance between new. cancelled and restructured business was only modestly positive.. The most important renewal was the 1st of April, Japanese renewal as many of the natural. catastrophe programs had suffered from series of losses in 2018, in particular, the everincreasing losses from typhoon Jebi. Loss effected wind and flood programs in Japan. which were the majority of those programs that were loss affected, as well as the. combined wind and flood and earthquake cover loss affected increased anywhere. between 10% and 30%. Some higher increases were even seen the sum of the. aggregate excess of loss covered, most of which had a total loss last year. On the other. hand, loss free programs and in particular earthquake only program saw flat renewals and. also some meaningful capacity was bound on multi-year terms and thus rate could not be. increased.. This resulted on average in an increase of the prices just under 10%. As we did not want. to put additional pressure on pricing, we kept our participation stable and thus our. premium increase was almost exclusively the result of increased prices and for coming in. at around 10%. From the other lines in Japan, we saw some opportunities to grow our. participation, which resulted in increased premiums to the tune of 8%.. Regarding the renewal from North America, we saw rather favorable trading condition. and thus we were able to increase our volume by 18%, stemming both from non-cat. property and casualty business with the emphasis lying on casualty. Outside Japan and for. US, catastrophe excess of loss business renewed quite stable and the rate and quality did. not entice us to grow the portfolio. Due to selective underwriting, we saw some. meaningful decreases of our premium volume and market share in the agricultural. business, where we also saw some increased exposure due to certain weather. phenomenon.. On the marine side, the most significant renewal in the first quarter was the marine liability. renewal, which is a rather large program also known as protection and indemnity business.. On this program, we increased our volume quite significantly, raised on our proprietary. terms. However, if we look at the marine business, including the January 1st renewals, we. kept the premiums largely unchanged. Unchanged, we also left the guidance for the. current year, even though the development so far during this year provided us with an. additional comfort level that the guidance should be achievable provided of course it's. large losses are not significantly above the large loss budget and there is no dislocation. of the capital market.. But firstly it has to do with the numbers of the first quarter, the -- regarding premium. growth and return on investment we were above our guidance. Furthermore, Roland. already mentioned that in relation to our continued shareholding in Viridium, we will see. the realization of off-balance sheet of valuation reserves to the tune of EUR98 million,. which will support our investment income and will of course report it in Life&Health. business group.. Regarding the dividend payout again provided that we reach our guidance, the dividend. of 2018 should provide the minimum benchmark for the dividend of 2019. So, it's very. likely that we will again be paying an extraordinary dividend. Regarding the outlook of the. Property&Casualty business for 2019, you can see that many segments, the arrows. pointing upwards. So we expect healthy growth on our Property&Casualty business for the. entire year. Also the profitability, but it's not perfect should still allow us to overall earn the. cost of capital, so that's the growth should be supported by the commensurate. profitability.. On Life&Health, we expect to see significant increased profitability mainly as the result of. our US mortality business should improve considerably, because the burden from the. recapture charges which are one-off burdens of course the reduce very remarkable. The. Financial Solutions business again carries the bulk of the profitability, but we already have. seen in the first quarter on longevity, we expect to earn the cost of capital, and when it. comes to premium growth, most of that were surfaced on the morbidity solutions. business. Therefore, positive outlook on the Life&Health business, altogether on the P&C. side for 2019 and in the medium-term, we expect that our strong competitive position. and our lower admin expense ratio will allow us to outperform the market.. On Life&Health, reduced burdens already mentioned from US mortality business will allow. us to grow the profitability and this does even include the negative developments that we. have seen in Australia, which we believe we have well under control. Finally, on the. investment income, continued positive cash flow should mean that in the mid-term, the. trend of the income from assets under management should be modestly upward.. On this positive note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation.. And we would be more than happy to answer your questions. Thank you very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) First question is from Farooq Hanif of Credit Suisse. Please go. ahead.. Farooq Hanif. Oh, hello, thank you very much, good morning. I had two questions if that's okay. Firstly on. your Solvency II slide, in the appendix, can you explain the operating impact of 0.4%, what. the impact of operating variances has been, so that if you look to the very clean quarter,. just to get an idea of what the operating growth would have been without those. variances. That's question one. And then question two, going back to Viridium, I just want. to understand a little bit more about how we should see the development of your. shareholder value in Viridium going forward, will it simply be a matter of unrealized gains. coming through in Life&Health Re or will we -- could we expect dividends or other. realizations in the future. So how should we think about modeling that? Thank you very. much.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, maybe I start with second question and maybe Roland can answer the first one.. Viridium, I mean we have basically seen when we originally invested in Viridium that our. investment was really paid back almost completely by dividends and retiring their. preference fab. That meant that the book value we had in the book for Viridium was. below EUR1 million. Now of course in the process of some reshuffling within the funds of. our majority co-investor, we have to realize the proper value for the Viridium business up. until there is a purchase of Generali Life. And that is where the one-off positive comes. from. Of course, we invest further moneys now in order to support the purchase of. Generali Life and if the development is similar to what we have seen now, we will see in. the future contributions from dividends and maybe again retiring of preference shares,. that's if all -- if the future is the resemble of what we have seen in the past, where we. have no reason to believe that that should not be the case. Then your first question is. around modification.. Roland Vogel. I must admit, we are not in the position to really comment on the details now, also I have. to admit, if you perhaps can repeat it and we can come back to you later, if there is an. (multiple speakers).. Farooq Hanif. I just wanted to -- for the sake of modeling Solvency II going forward, the operating. impact that you show 0.4 points is a smaller part obviously and clearly there are some. negative variances in that, because I'm sure you on an operating basis will more than that.. So I wanted to, if you could break down the operating impact between what is operating,. operating and what is non-operating operating, if you understand what I mean.. Roland Vogel. Again, I've done this -- we have published all the information as this was Q1 call, I don't. have the details with me now.. Ulrich Wallin. We can send you the answer.. Roland Vogel. Yeah.. Farooq Hanif. Could I just ask quickly on -- apologies for my lack of knowledge, but how much are you. investing in Generali Leben?. Ulrich Wallin. That's probably proprietary information I would say, because I don't think the price was. necessarily -- it was necessarily published. So I can't give you that answer, but it is below. triple-digit million, so it's double-digit million.. Farooq Hanif. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, good morning, everyone. Just one question on life insurance, could you give us a hand. on, I guess what the underlying results look like versus you're kind of EUR400 million to. EUR450 million guidance you've talked about in the past. I'm just trying to work out. whether it feels like the guidance still is pretty conservative or not. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I don't think we said EUR400 million to EUR450 million, we said above EUR400. million and that is quite (multiple speakers) that is quite conservative now.. Kamran Hossain. Okay, brilliant. So and in terms of I guess the quantum of Australia versus the West US. mortality experience, how does that kind of balance out or does that net out that could. you.... Ulrich Wallin. Well, Australia have a lower double-digit million, negative impact that we expect for the. entire year. I mean it's not that there is nothing we can do about, of course, I mean the. which of course distracted the market player to some extent and also basically increase. the disability claims both on TBD as well as DII. But I mean of course in our Australian. business, and this is a new business that we write, we have the ability to increase rate. So. we will rectify the situation and definitely will not accept any new business there, where. we are not confident that even on those new trading conditions, we could reach the. necessary profitability. So we don't really see that as a long-term fundamental problem,. because I mean the run-off of our legacy DII has been -- has actually been quite positive.. So I mean it is something that we have to deal with, but nothing to be unduly concerned. about.. Kamran Hossain. Good and thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from William Hawkins of KBW. Your line is now open.. William Hawkins. Hi, thank you very much. Really, congratulations on your tenure at Hannover Re, I hope you. have an enjoyable future.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you.. William Hawkins. So yet speaking up on what Kamran just asked, little bit more detail on Australia please. I. think you just indicated, so just to double check, to extent that there is any remedial action. required for the rest of this year, it's measured in the double digits of millions. Just to. confirm, you said that until help me understand from -- that is correct, yeah?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah, that's correct.. William Hawkins. Great. Roughly speaking what are the reserves over some insured are in this portfolio. that's affected, that's kind of question number one. And then question number two, can. you just help me understand a little bit more of the reserve development movement this. quarter in non-life. I can't remember, so if you can just confirm me what you think is the. normal level of positive reserve development, because my suspicion is that the Jebi. figure alone shoots or wipes that out and so to the extent that it clearly hasn't in your. overall results, if you just be clearer, was there a positive, a specific positive that offset. Jebi or is all of this just kind of lost in the rounding of your billions of reserves? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, William. Well, I mean on the Australian business, that is basically business. largely that we have written from 2013 onwards. And it is what's called lump sum. business, as well as DII business. And of course the expectations are that this business. has the future positive cash flow and that is reflected in the rather low reserves I would. say. What happened, I mean and I should also say that there are significant differences,. the way we write DII here as compared to the legacy DII. And the most important. difference here that we can increase the rate and we have already increased the rates on. this business in the past in order to keep it profitable and we are engaged to do that now. again.. is the retention of the ceding companies were always rather low on the -- on the new. business the retentions are quite meaningful. Therefore you have much better alignment. of interests and then on the legacy DII. But we also have seen that the lump sum. business, which is Life and TPD, which historically has actually been quite profitable, why. it's not be negative, the profitability has more than halved on that business. And this is. due to the fact that the TPD payout has actually increased rather significant. So there is a. little bit of need for increased of rates as well. And that is really how we think we should. solve the problem. The good thing on both end is the full alignment of interest that help. this with our ceding companies, which makes the overall corrective actions a little bit more. easy.. William Hawkins. So I'm sorry to come back and drive the call, just to make sure I understood what you just. said. The issue that you're talking about has nothing to do with the legacy business that. you had addressed with the big charges back in 2013. So even the new business that you. started writing has actually proven to be not good as you'd originally hoped?. Ulrich Wallin. That is a new business and that is the result actually of the ramifications of the. investigations of the Royal Commission.. William Hawkins. Got you. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. But that's a market wide phenomenon, I mean if you look at the market figures for. Australian life business in the second half of 2018, you will see a significant deterioration. of those result. And unfortunately we couldn't isolate ourselves from that.. William Hawkins. Sure.. Ulrich Wallin. Roland Vogel. Yes, I can take that. Well, I think with all uncertainties I think the numbers we gave over the. positive EUR100 million. Again we have sometimes larger transactions, which can interfere. million or EUR49 million and the calculated run-off result including that for the first quarter. without Jebi around EUR120 million or EUR130 million in that area. The rest of the positive. and negatives were really in line with expectation, nothing extraordinary which is worth. mentioning here.. William Hawkins. Very helpful, thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Sami Taipalus of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.. Sami Taipalus. Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one, just sorry to sort of bore you on the. Life&Health reinsurance business, but I didn't quite get a feel for the -- for your comments. about the underlying profitability there in the first quarter, you've obviously had some. negative drag from the -- from Australia, but it also seems like maybe the US mortality. was a bit stronger than expected and the investment income was I guess also quite. strong. So could you just comment on whether you -- it would be -- would it be sensible to. annualize this run rate or do you think that you were slightly so ahead or behind there and. just a bit more insight into moving parts that would be great.. And then second on the structured reinsurance business. I didn't quite understand how. the moving parts you mentioned upfront would affected the results, so if you could just. run through that a little bit more in detail. And I mean maybe I'm wrong, but my. understanding most of this should be quite a stable business in terms of margin. So it'd. be great to understand what drove that volatility. Thank you.. Well, I would say on the Life&Health side there was not many extraordinary developments. in the first quarter, maybe with the exception of -- I mean the derivatives here mainly the. ModCo derivative. So I mean from that point of view, I would probably caution to take the. -- outside Viridium to take the first quarter times four. But if you want to take something. times four, it's probably north of EUR100 million, I would say just only slightly north of. EUR100 million. This of course considering that there is significant volatility on a quarterly. basis, which of course reduces the lot if you look on an annual basis and if you look on a. three average, the volatility is very low on the Life&Health business.. When it comes to the structural business, we make it little bit difficult for you because we - I mean aggregate the structured business the CRS business. And the ILS business is. really business we don't keep retention, but only keep part of the premiums as a fee, that. means that the combined ratio on structured business normally is well below 10%. And. then if you. of course add that to the higher combined ratio on the structured business, it looks little. bit nicer, as the ILS business in the first quarter has actually grown, so the profitability from. the ILS business has grown is valid had a positive impact on the combined ratio.. Otherwise, the structured business was largely in line with expectation coming in with a. combined ratio around 98% that's nothing then drawn and something spend a little bit. better than expected. But we expect that between 98% and 99.5% every quarter, so 98%. was on the positive side of that bracket.. Sami Taipalus. Okay, so just to be clear it's a pure mix shift, basically you had an unusually large volume. of that.. Ulrich Wallin. Exactly, yeah.. Sami Taipalus. Okay, great. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Oh, hi, there. Yes, Ulrich, just congratulations on your tenure and good luck for your. retirement, maybe this is your last opportunity, could you give us a sort of overall view on. reinsurance market conditions. Your tone sounded slightly more cautious than maybe at. the time of the full-year in terms of quite a lot of capacity coming back in opportunistic,. maybe in light of that just give us a sense of how you think the midyear renewals may pan. out. The second question, just a sort of small question, what exactly happened in UK,. London market, we had a very high combined ratio 122, was that large loss related or Jebi. related? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, the overall reinsurance market concentrate on the P&C side, because it's more. cyclical than the Life&Health side. I would say still really characterized by most of the. market player wanting to add capacity to the market and increase their shares and you -we haven't seen maybe with some exception from the RF capacity, any withdraws of. capacity, that underlying mean that the market is biased market and quiet soft. There is of. course some discipline in the market due to the rather disappointing results of the market. as a whole in 2017 and 2018, but I mean we haven't seen any capacity reductions or. capacity withdraws and therefore it remains a competitive market.. I mean as I said the pricing level is a bit better than the previous two years, but it needs. new fair amount to desire, because I mean coming close to the 15 level what actually be. probably more is adequate. We have a slight advantage here with our expense ratio. advantage, which we actually extended in the first quarter 2019 to reduced expenses on. the Life&Health side with increased volumes. So that's quite positive in a difficult market.. As far as the London market is concerned, wasn't really the effect of development and. tied from Jebi. There was some more -- on some of the large business that we support. through what's called trade capital, where we provide a quota share to a corporate name. and thus have a provision like corporate name ourselves. So we participate in the capital. of the large (inaudible) and we then book the result as premium and losses. And I mean. the rather unfortunate development of the results in the large market is also shining. through on those kind of participations.. In addition on the UK motor excess of loss business, we still, I mean book the reserves. also on the new business based on minus 0.7% discount rate, which means that we book. discount rates then minus 0.75, it's probably on average I would say the UK motor excess. of loss pricing might be at 0.5% discount rate. And we book the initial loss reserves as. this rather high overall combined ratio. Naturally, should the UK government feel fit to. reduce or to increase the auction discount rate, then of course also the reserves on the. newly written business will presumably come down.. Andrew Ritchie. All right. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Michael Haid of Commerzbank. Please go ahead.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just one question left from my side, typhoon Jebi. you mentioned EUR48 million or EUR49 million net increase of reserves. Could you also. give us the gross figure of -- for the increase of reserves and did the amount -- to what. extent did the whole account covers -- play a role in this additional reserving?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, first of all, the whole account cover did not play a role because the typhoon Jebi loss. now it's pretty close to the retention of the whole account cover. That of course would not. allow to grow a lot further. If you look at the extra advise and paid losses at the end of the. first quarter and compare that to our reserves that we had at the end of the year 2018,. there were still quite a bit of distance between our reserve and the paid and advise cover.. However, due to our reserving practice that if we get adviced losses to layer in the. program, we would normally put a reserve on the next play up as well. And that despite. the fact that from the pure advised losses, we could have kept the reserve unchanged. due to this method, we increased the -- our own reserves on Jebi quite significantly.. Michael Haid. So the gross and the net figure are fairly similar?. Ulrich Wallin. No, the gross figures is a lot higher because that again has to do with the K-transaction. because basically all the heavy losses from Japanese natural catastrophe excess of loss,. they all see that to the K. And also of course on our ILS business, we upfront a fair amount. of Japanese excess of loss business to transform the business into the capital market,. they of course that shows up on the gross loss as well, but of course this is not -- they. have no effect on the net loss.. Michael Haid. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca, your line is now open.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes, good morning. Just two quick follow-up please. In the terms of last quarter we were. discussing at length the combined ratio, the 97% and the business mix and the structured.. And now we produced even below 96% and structured well even low growth as you said,. is there something that should drive us to 97% or even this kind of 96% level should be. achievable, given what you know today. That's the first question. Second question is, just a. very small numbers one, the life -- the funds withheld in the investment income you've. seen sort of a big jump, which has taken us back to the levels of '14, '15, '16 even, but not. seen in last few years in a quarter, the EUR70 million plus range, isn't there some one-off. or just something to note here please. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the funds withheld on Life&Health, I means that's some new business that we. or you should always bear in mind that the income -- investment income on the funds. withheld are part of the overall margins of those treaties. So I mean part of that is always. offset by losses on the underwriting side, so that the overall margin of the 3D is in line visa-vis it has been quoted, of course earnings cost of capital. I mean as far the combined. ratio is concerned, I have to say that the first quarter of 2019 really the underlying loss. development outside some major losses was actually quite favorable, but there is no. guarantee that that will stay for the entire year. One would say that I mean the underlying. loss development below the major losses in 2018 overall was some relatively high losses. and I mean slight improvement at least in the first quarter, quite a good improvement on. that end in first quarter of 2019. But I mean quarterly results on reinsurance always are. little bit difficult to interpret because naturally I mean there is volatility on a quarter-byquarter basis, even with the underlying loss ratios, I mean, lot is actually casualty and. things like that, but I mean in first quarter just had been pretty good on the line.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes, good morning, everybody, I have also two questions. First question is on the other. income line within the Life segment, this EUR62 million in Q1, is this -- should this be seen. at normal level going forward also. And then secondly on the Boeing loss or the airline. loss which you report on, my understanding is that, this reflects the loss for the airlines, is. there any risk that due to liability issues this is going up?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I would say the other income line from deposit account really was quite positive in. the first quarter, so just multiplying this by four would probably be quite optimistic, but it's. productivity close to that. I mean and that's actually quite a reliable number, I would say.. On Boeing, well, I mean two ways to use, of course, the Boeing losses when it comes to. Boeing itself also includes the Lion Air loss from last year, because if I understand that. from our experts, the grounding loss would actually fall on the Lion Air loss being the first. one that showed an issue that finally was resulting in the grounding. So the grounding. liability which is supplemented at EUR500 million is not featuring in this European airlines. loss.. For us, I would say yes. I mean of course there is the possibility based on US jurisdiction on. the passenger legal liability losses when there is a product liability case against Boeing. and at least claim and lapse that that is the case, that might drive up of course the liability. losses as the awards in the US court systems generally tend to be somewhat higher than. in other jurisdictions.. So we have to see how that develops. On the other hand, I mean for us on the net side,. I'm not too concerned, because we for all the comprehensive specific retro fashion. protection that that would limit our losses from these aviation disaster. Naturally I mean,. aviation excess of loss is part of K, so little bit more than 40% of all our losses from the. excess of losses would be covered by K and then we have in addition to that excess of. loss on excess of loss protection. If you look at the direct facultative and pro rata, we have. a comprehensive program covering that and there regardless how much the losses would. increase on a pool of basis this -- on this basis tool us together will probably not exceed. on a net basis $5 million, that's just the way our protections are constructed.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay, thank you very much. And all the best to you.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions, I hand back to the speakers.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, thank you very much for listening into our first quarter conference call. Currently, most. things are pretty clear. So we I think have a record time for the conference call. I cannot. promise you that that will still be the case on the second quarter or half year, but yes. thanks for listening and all the best to you. Have a nice day.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect now.",20190507_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2019-5-7_DN000000002633135788.pdf,2019-05-07
10,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on the Q2 2020 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is. being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Jean-Jacques. Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Well, thank you very much and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome. you to our conference call presenting our results for the first half of this year. As usual, I. will start with an overview before our CFO, Roland Vogel goes over the financials in detail.. I'll then comment on the outlook for the year and for the Q&A, I'm additionally joined by. my board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.. Despite burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hannover Re can look back at the first six. months that demonstrated again the risk bearing capacity of our business model and in. light of the fact that we have absorbed in total pre-tax impact of more than EUR660. million from COVID-19 in our P&C and Life and Health segments. The Group net income. of EUR402 million is quite satisfactory.. The solvency ratio of around 225% at the end of the second quarter remained. comfortably above our threshold of 200%, which is even more positive. Additionally,. Hannover Re was able to grow the gross premium by 12.2% adjusted for currency effects,. confirming the good position of the company in an improving market environment.. Going into the details of the COVID-19 impact, in P&C reinsurance, we have booked. around EUR380 million related to COVID-19 claims in the second quarter, bringing the full. impact to EUR600 million including the EUR220 million from the first quarter. This increase. is the result of additional market information and further scenario analysis also including. some bottom up market information at this time. The major part of the EUR600 million. takes the form of IBNR reserves and affected business lines are largely the same as in the. first quarter, namely business interruption, credit and surety, and event cancellation.. Apart from this, we expect some other lines to be impacted to some extent and have. reserved for this accordingly. Due to COVID-19 related losses, the large loss budget of. EUR414 million for the first half of 2020 has been exceeded by EUR323 million. This also. explains the 102.3% combined ratio, which is above our target of 97%. The COVID-19. impact of the result of our life and health reinsurance business group was EUR63 million.. Against this backdrop, the EBIT of EUR214 million is strong pointing to a good underlying. profitability, particularly in our Financial Solutions business, which is unaffected by the. pandemic.. Also excluding the COVID-19 impact, the US mortality experience was in line with. expectations. At 2.7%, the return on investment is still satisfactory, even though initially. effects of the volatility on the market at a moderate impact in the second quarter.. The next slide confirms that new business production is fully intact, despite the changes in. our working environment due to COVID-19. Our profitable premium growth is the main. driver for the very positive operating cash flow of EUR1.7 billion in the first half of 2020 and. has also fueled the growth in assets under management shown on the right side of this. slide.. Looking at the details of our assets, the positive change in valuation reserves was partly. mitigated by negative effects from currency translation. Altogether, assets under own. management stood at EUR48.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. Looking at our. capital position, shareholders equity increased slightly. This is quite positive against the. backdrop of our EUR663 million dividend payment in the second quarter. And given the. fact that the Group absorbed a negative COVID-19 impact of approximately the same. amount in the first half year.. Admittedly, the positive impact from the decrease in interest rates was helpful more than. compensating for negative effect from increased credit spreads and currency translation,. a leading to an overall increase in the OCI. The composition of the total capital on the left. side of this slide is unchanged. The EUR500 million hybrid we issued in early July is not. included in these numbers and will be reported in the third quarter. However, the picture. on this slide might still look quite similar at the end of the third quarter because we have. another EUR500 million of hybrid with first call date in September.. In any case, the new hybrid issuance can be seen as additional capital because we had. already issued a EUR750 billion bonds in 2019. The reason for the issuance of additional. hybrid capital is two fold. Firstly, the market environment is favorable and secondly, we. want to be in the best possible position to take advantage of improving market conditions. in the reinsurance market.. Finally, it is also important to mention that we still have a high degree of flexibility around. hybrid capacity, also including the increased leverage.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will as always explain the. figures in more detail.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yeah. Good morning and thank you Jean-Jacques. Moving directly to the segmental. reporting, I will start with the development of our Property and Casualty business group.. On a highly diversified basis, gross premium grew by 16% adjusted for currency effects. and here the Americas and the APAC region contributed particularly well to this growth.. And overall, the development was more driven by property than casualty business. The. large loss situation for Hannover Re was similar to the first quarter and can be split into. two parts, on the one hand the normal large loss experience was rather benign. On the. other hand, we had the impact from COVID-19. Compared to the first quarter, our more. detailed scenario analysis takes into account the additional information we have received. over the last three months. For example, regarding the exposure for business interruption. in all the different countries and sectors including their respective uncertainties. But our. various scenario still produce a broad spectrum of potential impacts on earnings. We are. in a situation, where we have not yet received the large number of claims notifications. from our clients yet and hence around 80% of the estimated $600 million total impact. consists of IBNR reserves based on our internal scenario analysis.. Jean-Jacques already mentioned the affected lines of business. By region, the exposure. is really across our book. We expect to see the biggest impact in the EMEA region,. particularly from business interruption. Overall, even though the EUR600 million provides. headroom for actual claims to be reported, we do not feel that we have sufficient data or. are able to make assumptions reliably enough especially around the duration of the. pandemic that would enable us to come up with an estimate we could call final.. As a result of the reserving for COVID-19 related claims, expectations, the large loss. budget for the first quarter was exceeded by EUR323 million, which accounts for roughly. 4.7% combined ratio points, adjusting the 102.3% reported combined ratio for this budget. overrun the figure would have been close to our 97% target. Just as as a note to. standalone Q2 budget of EUR226 million was exceeded by EUR227 million and therefore. increased the combined ratio by 6.4 percentage points.. The run-off of our reserves overall was positive in the first half year 2020 and the. development in the second quarter was more in line with our expectation, in contrast with. the slightly negative runoff results in the first quarter. Altogether, the confidence level. should not have changed materially since year-end, but we should also not assume that. we were able to strengthen it.. Net investment income decreased by EUR40 million with lower contributions from private. equity and inflation-linked bonds within the ordinary, as well as higher impairments only. partly offset by an increase -- a slight increase in realized gains. Other income expenses. were positive by EUR18 million, mainly driven by positive currency effect, altogether the. EBIT margin decreased by 2% mainly due or sorry -- 4.2% mainly due to the weaker. underwriting result.. Finally, the tax ratio is below the normal level, because of the COVID-19 IBNR reserves to. a large extent affected the result of our higher tax entities and hence the share of taxable. income in high tech countries is significantly lower than usual. Total net large losses. including COVID-19 related claims accounted for EUR737 million in the first half year,. exceeding the budget of EUR414 million by EUR323 million.. As you can see in the chart, the difference between the gross and the net is lower than. usual because we have treated the main part of our estimates for COVID-19, as gross or. net and our ILS business has not really been affected by large losses. Overall, the EUR737. million net loss already represents 80% of our EUR925 million large loss budget for the. full year and we still have the peak hurricane season ahead of us. In the end, this means. that there is an increased likelihood that 2020 will be the fourth consecutive year with. large losses above expectations, which is not only true for Hannover Re, but for the. industry as a whole and should trigger positive pricing movements going forward.. On the next slide, you see the large loss of this includes six events in the area of natural. catastrophes, the largest being the tornadoes in the US with EUR31 million and one. property loss. Altogether, this adds up to EUR137 million, which would have been very. benign excluding the COVID-19 related loss.. The next slide shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business. Looking at. the numbers for the first half year, the impact from additional reserving for COVID-19 led. to an increase in the combined ratio in all regional markets with European being impacted. mostly. Not surprisingly, the most visible effect is on our credit and surety business, where. we expect to see an increased loss activity due to the impact of the economic downturn.. Agricultural business was affected by the bush fires in Australia and on the positive side,. the technical profitability of our aviation and marine business was very favorable. Overall,. the combined ratio stands at the rather high 102.3%.. So let's move to the life and health. Gross year was mainly driven by a large financing. treaty in Australia, which we wrote in the Q4 of 2019. However, this was partly mitigated. by the expected reduction in premium volume due to the effect of recaptures in our US. mortality portfolio, as a result of our management actions in the previous year. Altogether,. gross premium increased by 3.6%, adjusted for currency effects. The impact from COVID19 is more moderate compared to our P&C business group, additional debts related to. COVID-19 had an impact of a bit more than EUR60 million in the first half year, more than. 50% of the book numbers are IBNR here as well.. By region, a little more than half of the impact is coming from our US portfolio apart from. COVID-19, the results of our life and health business group was quite favorable. The. legacy US mortality portfolio performed in line with expectations and the earnings. contributions from our financial solutions business in particularly continued to be excellent.. Adjusted for the good EUR60 million COVID impact, the EBIT would have been close to. last year's level, which included a positive one-off of almost EUR100 million as you may. remember. The net investment income decreased mainly due to the positive one-off. effect recorded in 2019, in the first half of 2020, the favorable ordinary income was. supported by an overall positive contribution from the change in fair value instruments. through P&L, even though the impact from ModCo derivative was slightly negative by. EUR10 million.. Other income and expenses are primarily driven by a further increase in the contribution. from financial solutions business, for which a large portion is recognized, according to the. deposit accounting method, currency effects in this quarter were slightly negative at 11.5%. the tax ratio is low or is below the normal level. Also here, mainly due to good results. from jurisdictions with the low tax rate.. On the next slide, we have included this one to provide some more insight into new. business production on the life side as well. This is not necessarily evident by looking at. the premium numbers according to IFRS due to the often long-term nature of the. business. As you can see both the new business and the pipeline business are rather. diversified by region and reporting category, but what is also visible is that developed. markets in particular in the area of financial solutions currently offer very attractive. opportunities.. Since we have only focused on the most important years in this overview, this does not. mean that we do not see any opportunities in the gray areas on the map, altogether with. the value of new business achieved in the first half year, we have built the good. foundation to achieve our full year target of at least EUR220 million of VNB.. But please bear in mind that the value of new business is often a bit lumpy and driven by. large deals. Against the backdrop of the significant market volatility in the first half year of. 2020, the development of our investments was satisfactory. It is pleasing to see that with. the return of 2.7%, the result is actually still in line with our initial full-year target, even. though some negative impacts were visible in the second quarter.. Two factors led to the decrease in ordinary income. Firstly, the contribution from our. inflation-linked bond portfolio purchase to hedge inflation risk that was lower due to the. decrease inflation -- increased inflation expectations and secondly, the returns from. private equity were also weaker than usual in the challenging market environment.. Realized gains are coming mainly from our fixed income portfolio apart from the normal. portfolio turnover, we sold around EUR0.5 billion in lower quality credits, before the crisis. actually started in Q1 and at the time, almost all sales within our fixed-income portfolios. were associated with realized gains. Impairments and depreciations were a little bit higher. than last year, mainly due to EUR45 million impairments from alternative investments. We. have not really quantified the COVID-19 impact on our investments because it's even. more difficult to argue what is really caused by the pandemic than it is in P&C or life and. health. One would assume that those EUR45 million without COVID-19 would not have. occurred. I already explained the main effect within the change in the fair value of financial. instruments, here the negative effect from our ModCo derivative was more than offset by. other hedging instruments. Unrealized gains increased remarkably to almost EUR3 billion,. driven by significantly lower interest rates and more moderate the negative impact from. increased credit spend, due to the recovery of the corporate bond markets in the second. quarter.. On the next slide if you see, you can see that we have actually not changed too much in. our asset allocation nor do we have any intention to do so, which you can see is that we. have used the price corrections on the stock markets in March to carefully re-enter and list. the equity buying a little bit less than EUR250 million. As I mentioned to you in May, we. have been following a passive de-risking approach with new money being invested in high. quality assets only and currently, we continue with that investment approach. The. contribution to ordinary investment income is diversified as usual. At this time, with a little. bit of a lower share from private equity as mentioned. I think this concludes my remarks. and I hand back to Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Thank you very much Roland. Moving to Slide 18. As you know we went through our profit. guidance in April, due to the uncertainties surrounding the future development of the. COVID-19 pandemic and with the peak hurricane season just beginning, we're not yet in a. position to precisely quantify the effects of the current pandemic on our business and our. investments over the course of the year. Looking at the target matrix with our initial. targets, you can see that almost all profitability targets are affected by the pandemic with. only the return on investments still above the set target. On the positive side, our. business growth is largely unaffected and our capitalization according to Solvency II is. comfortably above the 200% target.. On the next slide the June-July treaty renewals were successful for Hannover Re. We're. clearly in an improving P&C market environment and we use this to grow our business at. increased rates and improved terms. One of the drivers is the US markets, where pricing. improved for both primary and reinsurance business.. On top of this, we were also able to increase our shares on a number of profitable. accounts generally. In Australia and in our agricultural business, we similarly grew our. portfolio at improved pricing and in credit and surety, we decided not to expand our book. at this stage, but still benefited from higher rates. Overall, the reported premium growth. of 11.6%. The risk adjusted price change was 5.1% for the total renewal business, and even. higher at almost 10% for non-proportional business.. On the next slide, we have updated our current assumptions for the impact of the. COVID-19 pandemic. There is still an elevated level of uncertainty, surrounding the loss. experience and the capital market environment. Still we would expect that the significant. amount of IBNR as part of the EUR600 million on the P&C side should bring us a lot closer. to our final estimate for the COVID-19 impact.. We see some likelihood for knock-on effect on D&O, E&O and other casualty lines and. have taken this to some extent into account for our half-year result. In life and health, we. observed that the excess mortality in the most exposed markets in the US and the UK is. considerably lower in our portfolio than in the general population, which can be explained. by socioeconomic factors and a different age structure.. The negative effect for our book was as commented EUR63 million in the first half of. 2020 and in comparison to P&C, I would say that we have not tried to get ahead of. potential developments with significant IBNR reserves in the same way for our life and. health business. Therefore, some further negative effects in the second half of the year. are still possible depending on the development of the pandemic.. On the other hand, we might see some positive effects in our UK longevity portfolio.. On the investment side, the lower income from alternative investments and inflationlinked bonds is already visible and might also impact the results in the second half year.. Apart from that, impairments are the main risk to our asset portfolio. Otherwise, we feel. comfortable with our high quality investment portfolio. To complete the picture, market. movements are having an impact on our capitalization, but not to an extent that would. bring our solvency ratio below 200% in the year-end 2020. Therefore, we have no. intention to change our general dividend policy for the financial year 2020.. On Slide 21, based on increasing demand for reinsurance and the favorable renewals year. to date, we see our book growing in an improving market environment. This is true for. most areas of our diversified P&C reinsurance portfolio and should also be supported by. an already observed flight to quality with highly rated reinsurers with a strong balance. sheet like Hannover Re, seeing higher demands than the average market players these. days.. Looking beyond the financial year 2020, I would also expect the generally positive trend. for P&C reinsurance market conditions to continue. The market environment is not. changing as dynamically on the life and health side as in P&C. However, we expect. additional demand for financial solutions business to support our clients in mitigating the. impact of the crisis.. Apart from this, we see particularly promising growth potential in the Asian markets. The. growth of our mortality business is impacted by the effect of recaptures in our US. mortality portfolio. Overall, I would say I see the Hannover Re Group well positioned to. absorb the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and to take advantage of opportunities in a. hardening reinsurance market. We're constantly monitoring developments and updating. our scenario calculations and we shall provide profit guidance again as soon as the. underlying probabilities are sufficiently reliable.. This concludes my remarks. And we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you. very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) And the first question we received is from Vikram Gandhi, Societe Generale.. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hello everybody, thank you for the opportunity, it's Vikram, SocGen. I've got three. questions. Firstly, can you split the EUR600 million COVID impact on P&C across the four. buckets, creating business interruption, contingency losses and others. The second is, I. see almost no retro offset on the COVID loss estimate for P&C and I'm aware you kind of. had a comment in your opening remarks that you haven't really assumed anything, but I. just wondered why should that be the case, particularly from BI losses and whether the. retro is expected to come into play if the gross losses rise materially from hereon. And. thirdly, can you just help us understand what is -- what is the outlook that is being currently. penciled in the solvency ratio of 225% in terms of the COVID losses versus what is already. there in IFRS. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Thank you very much. I think I'll ask Sven to address the first and the second question and. Roland will cover the capital position.. Sven Althoff. Yeah. Very -- very happy to give you an idea about how the EUR600 million is split by line. of business, we have approximately 40% coming from the business interruption side, 25%. from the credit side, and 20% from the events cancellation and contingency business,. which brings us to 85% and the remaining 15% of splits across other classes of business. like travel business, engineering business, and a few other lines.. This is the result of our top-down view of the reserve position of the EUR600 million, so. given the very low number of actually incurred losses that Roland has mentioned in his. remarks, only 20% of the overall number, the remaining 80% are driven by IBNR. So the. exact splits like a lot of business is maybe a little less precise compared to natural. catastrophe losses at the same moment in time, but it's a good view on how the losses. could split up in the end. When it comes to the benign retro recoveries, all retro vehicles. are in place, but the numbers I have just given to you are indicating that our excess of loss. structures are not at a level impacted yet, where we would actually be able to make. recoveries and when it comes to our K-transaction, we have only book those losses. against our K-transactions that have actually been advised as the incurred losses from our. ceding companies, we have not booked any of our IBNR against our K-transaction. That. will follow in the next few quarters, given that we will move from a top down more to. bottom up reserving approach on COVID.. Roland Helmut Vogel. And maybe with regard to the the solvency ratio, if I understood your question correctly, it. was -- how much is already kind of the considered also on a longer-term basis. The. answer here is that we have considered everything, which has been accounted according. to IFRS as well under Solvency II, sometimes the valuations differ a little bit.. Potential longer term changes for instance, higher mortality or lower longevity, this has not. been considered yet and will only be done as soon as we know what the longer term. impact might be.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, good morning. Couple of questions on life and health rate. You mentioned that you. probably haven't baked in as much IBNR on the life side, as you have on the P&C side. In. terms of the EUR63 -- in terms of the EUR63 million number that you've set aside, can you. maybe give us a little bit of help on what that kind of baked in -- is that kind of debt as of. now or is that kind of more access mortality in certain specific region going forward.. And then how to think about the potential drag from results going forward, should it be. multiples less than EUR63 million later in the year or can you just -- any idea as how to. think about that drag?. some benefits there, I imagine that would like to be the case, in the past you've been. fairly reluctant to recognize some of these, tables have moved, but you want to actually. see real kind of -- I guess people passing away before you recognize it. Are you starting. to bake that in or is that just something that's another thing in your arsenal to kind of, you. know, I guess having for buffers and kind of get earnings up in future years. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Yeah. Klaus will address the two questions on them.. Klaus Miller. Yes. Let's start with the IBNR, because a pandemic is developing so far, we thought we. should change our processes here a little bit. Usually we close the second quarter, six. weeks before the end of June. So in mid-May for claims accounting, at least in the US,. which has the most impacted market here, we have changed that and started booking. claims until 30th of June till the last, very last date.. So the IBNR number is relatively small in the US, it's a little bit higher in the rest of the. world. As Roland said, we have a little bit more than 50% of the EUR63 million from the. US and there was a certain delay in these numbers we get in the US, and let's just talk. about the US here, we get in the US 85% of our business reported on the claims' side on. a daily or weekly basis, that means the clients and claims basically immediately to us.. There was still a delay of about three weeks from the person dying till the reinsurer gets. the notification of the death. And there was an additional on top four weeks delay on. average before we get the call of the death. That means our numbers in death counts are. more up to date then the reason of the death certificate and the reason for death. So it's. quite possible that we have even more COVID claims, we have already accounted for, but. have not knowing that they are COVID. We have certainly an expectation that the claims. we have seen in the first half of this year will be slightly higher in the second half of the. year. This all in panic, the largest country currently impacted by COVID, the US start. managing the pandemic or not. When you look at the largest countries impacted right. now, it's the US and we have a significant portfolio there, then the next ones are Brazil. and India and who's the next Russia I guess and we have next to no business there. So all. depends on how the US manages the pandemic or start managing it.. On the longevity side, we have unfortunately to follow certain accounting rules that if you. have loss in a treaty, you have to reserve immediately for whatever can happen in the. future. If you have treaties performing better than expected, we cannot take that into. account, so even if we change our model slightly and we expect a better longevity result. in the future, we will account for it, as it comes in and not earlier. So we will not change. that and we can't.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks. Can I just clarify, so you said H2 is likely to be more in terms of claims than in H1.. So if I can say EUR63 million, it's probably going to be a bigger number of that in H2.. Klaus Miller. Yeah. It will be a bigger number.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. ahead, sir.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi, there. Sorry, I wanted to go back first of all to, Sven made a comment that you haven't. assumed any K session recoveries. I mean, I'm assuming quite a lot of the BI losses will. ultimately be claimed by your against CAT XL treaties, which I thought CAT XL would be. covered by the K vehicle, so do we have a situation where your net COVID P&C loss could. actually reduce over the year, as the losses convert from IBNR to reported claims and a lot. of those would go through classes of business covered by K.. I think that's the implication, but maybe just clarify that. The only other questions I had,. why was the life result so strong underlying like COVID, I mean do we extrapolate that or. are there some one-offs in terms of non-COVID biometric experience or the deposit. treaty businesses. And then the other question was a non-life excluding COVID, the. underlying I think it was 98 something combined in Q2. And as I'm always hesitant to draw. any conclusion on one quarter, is there any driver or this is very conservative current year. reserving ex-COVID?. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Thank you. Sven will cover the retro parts and the underlying business of the non-life side. and Klaus will follow-up on life and health.. Sven Althoff. On the retro part, Andrew, the small difference between gross and net on COVID, the 8.4. million we are showing on all large loss list, is actually as a result from sessions against K.. As I said, we have only booked those losses against K, which have actually been advised. by ceding companies if not done the same for our general IBNR positions here.. And I would not like to guide you to say this gives the potential that the net number. should be lower than the EUR600 million, but if you can look at the EUR600 million with. that feature being additional conservatism built into the number.. Andrew Ritchie. that going to be mostly through proportional contracts, which aren't covered or mostly. through just CapEx, which would be covered by K.. Andrew, that will be -- that will be a mix, it will be some pro rata, some risk but of course. protections are providing coverage for pandemic exposure, which is not always the case.. the 40% of the overall EUR600 million figure is business interruption related, which of. course brings you to a number of EUR240 million, this would not all be suitable towards K. given that this is coming from a mix basket of the pro rata risk and some CAT.. Kamran Hossain. Okay.. Klaus Miller. And could you repeat the question on the underlying?. Andrew Ritchie. Well, I just -- it looked like the underlying combined ex-COVID was relatively high in Q2, I. think you said 98 something. And I think it was running around 97 underlying in Q1, so was. there something else occurring or conservative booking or high attritional losses or. something else in underlying business.. Klaus Miller. Well, as my colleagues have mentioned, we are EUR323 million over and above our large. loss budget for the first half of the year, if you deduct that from the combined ratio, you. are at 97.6%. Yes, that is higher than the target combined ratio of 97%. But let me put it. this way, if we had only had the EUR130 million of non-COVID with major losses and we. would still have booked the full loss budget for the first half of the year, I'm pretty. confident that we would have shown a combined ratio below 97%. But given COVID, given. that the hurricane season is ahead of us, we decided to just let those 97.6% out of our. machine and not really adjust on it.. Okay.. Klaus Miller. On the life business, the underlying profitability was pretty strong in the first half year.. There are two reasons for that. One is we have increased our Financial Solutions business. and of course, this should continue for the next couple of years. So this is not a quarter. effect, this will be there for the next couple of years.. And of course, I also expect that we get more claims, as Jean-Jacques pointed out. towards the end of the year to support our clients to have problems with COVID-19 and. the balance sheet. The other thing is, please be reminded that we have retention of. EUR20 million for life and two more claims could make a EUR40 million different and a. swing of plus-minus EUR50 million in the quarter would be absolutely normal and it was a. good quarter, we didn't have any really large claims. But still, if you go through all the. numbers and add them up, you will find a plus 10, minus 10 every now and then. So it was. a good quarter, natural volatility to the positive side plus more financial solutions business,. which is here to stay.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from Paris Hadjiantonis, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are doing all well. A few questions from my side. as well. Firstly, I think going back to the normalized combined ratio, I just wanted to check. if there is any benefit from lower frequency or do have actually seen any lower frequency. from other lines of business that benefit to an extent from COVID. so I'm thinking motor. business et cetera. If you have seen that have booked it, so you see XX 97.44 for the half. year, probably a bit higher or do you see the usual cautionary bodies already in the. numbers. Then the second question is on more reinvestment yield. Can you give us an. idea of where it stands right now given the the pronounced moves in interest rates. And. lastly, I guess this is more of a strategic question. Hannover Re historically has been a. company that it doesn't really led the crisis go to waste. So given what is happening right. now in the market, do you think that there are any opportunities for you to expand. strategically in certain region for through M&A. So if you could give us some ideas on that. front that would be quite interesting. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Thank you, Paris. So the first question on P&C, Sven will address. Reinvestment yield,. Roland and I'll take your third question.. Sven Althoff. Yeah. On the normalized combined ratio side, we are seeing improved frequency in. classes like motor, but we have not changed our ultimate loss ratio assumptions going. into the year 2020. We may do so later in the year, but given that we are only seeing that. improvement for a few months by now, we didn't feel that it's prudent to already change. the ultimate loss ratio assumptions. So in a few classes, which clearly have lower losses. due to the much lower economic activity, there is a certain level of conservatism built into. those usual our assumptions due to the fact that we have not reduced them, but I. wouldn't overestimate that effect at this stage, given that we're only talking about the. number of months rather than quarters, where we are seeing that improvement of. frequency.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yeah. Paris, I am actually not really in a position to give you an exact reinvestment yield, as. we usually do, so because we have implemented this de-risking strategy to some extent,. so in that regard it would be a bit difficult to say if we reinvest exactly as we are invested. today, reinvestment yields would be XYZ. We definitely do invest at remarkably lower. rates than we currently earn. So there will be a drag on the ROI if that continues. Again, I. think we will present the more concrete numbers at the occasion of our Investors Day. In. that regard, the 2.7% might not be achievable for the full year, but that also really. depends a little bit on the investment -- reinvestment policy and approach, which is a bit. uncertain right now. Sorry for that.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. environment. We have loss activities for the last few years, maybe not CAT. We have the. COVID exposure and the expected losses and uncertainties in the market related to that. is a big opportunity for us, where we've seen a momentum confirmed during the July. renewals. So the 1st of January renewals on the P&C side, I expect it to be going into the. right direction from our end. I think we already see the flight to quality in the market when. alluded to that and we received numerous requests from clients, from the broker. community for increased shares, as there is a focus on the better capitalized companies.. So an additional window for us to grow and then we will take advantage of that flight to. quality.. I think the third aspects, which Klaus mentioned is financial solutions, but also generally. balance sheet protection also in P&C, where we are increasing the dialog with our clients. and we probably see a number of transactional opportunities in the coming 12 to 18. months, also partly related to the COVID situation.. M&A, we always look at M&A, but of course we benchmark on the one hand side the. valuations, the knowledge and acquisition will bring to us. And the cost of complexity. versus organic scenarios, which gave us additionally attractively priced business. At this. stage with the current rate of growth in our business, the benchmark is very high for an. M&A play, but we keep looking and we never excluded, but I think the organic. opportunities are very material for us and particularly for '21.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Good morning. Thank you. So two questions from me please. One is just, when I look. at the Slide 10 and see the credit surety 130% combined ratio, which probably implies for. the full year 115% or something on that. It's quite higher than even in the crisis, the global. financial crisis 10 years ago or 12 years ago, is there any assumptions in your loss. estimates of governmental health on this credit surety line. That's the first question.. Second question is, when you talked about the knock on effect and thanks for splitting the. credit -- the COVID losses by line, but I noticed that the last element, the other you didn't. clearly mention the D&O, the casualties those kind of lines, you said that it's still not there. yet, or is it within that line and that's what we should take away. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Sven?. Sven Althoff. Yeah. Let me -- let me start with the second question, classes like D&O would be in the. 15% bucket, which I mentioned. Yes, you're right, I've only mentioned engineering and. travel, but D&O and few other classes within that bucket, but at this stage, it's only pure. IBNR, I mean there is no loss estimates from the client side and we will have to wait a little. bit for potential losses to materialize on that site, one lot that -- that this an area of. particular uncertainty.. When it comes to the credit combined ratio, yes, you're right, with the 130%, we are. significantly over and above the additional combined ratio, we had to book during the. financial crisis. But of course, the 130% are only booked against half a year of earned. premium rather than the full year's worth of premium. And secondly, the economic. situation is much more severely impacted than during the financial crisis in '08 and '09. and what that will mean from an insolvency point of view, which is the main trigger on the. you know that a lot of governments have eased the rules for companies when they have. to report insolvency situation due to COVID. So the companies have extended reporting. lines, some of them are coming to an end now. So we might see a first spike of. insolvencies during the third quarter.. And so of course very, very difficult to pre-empt what may happen in the future when it. comes to companies declaring insolvency and what will then subsequently happen with -either calling the debt or restructuring the debts, which of course is always a loss. mitigating factor for the banks and for the credit insurers, restructuring of debts. So. therefore, we have been a little bit cautious and put a little extra on our financial crisis,. experience in 2008 or '09, but that's a great deal of science around that, it's a lot about. our own expectations.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you very much, Sven.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead, sir.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning everyone. One question left on the life side. I think that in the past you. provided the sensitivity to your EBIT number, which was a 5% excess mortality was. implying a negative EUR130 million on your EBIT for life. Just wanted to know if you could. put a EUR63 million in the context of this guidance or the sensitivity and if it was really a. valid one going forward.. The second question was on the 15% net premiums earned gross in P&C, I mean looking. at the guidance, the initial guidance for 2020 that you put out early in the year, I think that. you were very cautious still at that stage on the gross of, the achievable gross on PC. So I. was wondering if you could mention any big and large quarter shut deals, which may have. inflated the number, maybe didn't think obviously the 15% growth. And the last question is. just -- just to understand on the Solvency II basis, so the 225%, I understand that actually. you have not provided any 12 months forward-looking view in this number. So it's more,. maybe Q1, which has been updated for the mark-to-market movement in capital. generation, COVID-19 losses, but not the economic one which would be closer to a kind. of ultimate loss estimates? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Klaus on the life side.. Klaus Miller. Yeah. I have to admit that to a large extent, this is pure guess work and as I said earlier, it. all depends on how the US will handle the pandemic in the future. The 5% was the. calculation we did a couple of weeks ago, we have seen that the mortality spiked in the. US, I guess in the second quarter when population mortality was 20% higher, but we have. seen that only a small fraction of that really found its way into the insured population and. even less into the reinsurance population. We have been quite lucky in the sense that two. years ago, we for totally different reasons increased our rates on the permanent business. and you know that COVID is especially a problem for the older population and we had a. problem with old age mortality and this was one of the reason why we increased rates,. where we could, so the effect on that was the business to a large extent was recaptured.. Now, I can't tell you what claims we don't see now, because we don't have the business. any longer.. So the 5% we used here was an artificial calculation that we assumed, let's say, the 20%. mortality increase in the population will lead to a 5% increase in our portfolio. We might be. lucky, it might be less. We still feel comfortable with this scenario, but I would not even call. it an estimate. It's a scenario calculation. I'm sorry that I can't be more precise here, but. there are too many uncertainties.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Sven, on P&C growth.. Sven Althoff. On the P&C growth side, we have a rather diversified, picture. So yes there are a very few. big transactions in there like a new motor quota share, which we have written in Canada. and also one or two bigger transactions, which we have written in China, but the growth is. coming from many lines of business and many territories. So there is no single reason. driving this development, it's a combination of the better rate, which is not only giving us. more premium on the existing business, but it's also making a business, which we have. not written in the past, writable again, which we have carefully started to do and it's the. flight to quality that Jean-Jacques has mentioned. So there is a very, very high demand for. our security right now and we could have grown even more if we had not respected. ourselves in a few areas like credit or US wind exposure, where we don't feel that the. time is good for us to grow our portfolio on that side. This will come back towards the end. of the year for two reasons.. First and foremost, there's hardly any business renewing from now until the end of the. year. So there will be very few areas, from which additional growth would come from. And. then of course in Q3 and Q4, we will see a little bit of a damp manufacturing from COVID. in our premium because in some classes of business as you know, insurers have decided. to return certain parts of that premium to policyholders, in reaction to the frequency. topics we'd be discussed earlier in the call. And as that there is always a little bit of a time. lag between the ceding companies doing so and us seeing it in our accounts, you will see. a little bit of that in Q3 and Q4. So for the entire year, I would still expect a double-digit. figure of growth on the P&C side, but closer to 10% compared to the 16% now.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. And Thomas, to come back to your Solvency II question, I think I did explain that. everything which has been considered here according to IFRS has always been -- has also. been considered in our solvency calculations. So that means the 600 are in, and if they. hold by the end of the year, it's one of the scenarios, so this one of our best estimate. scenarios, if the hold that is a fully considered. Klaus mentioned that the likelihood that. potentially the IBNR in life might not have the same likelihood to hold. Moreover, we have. already included in our Solvency numbers, the capital requirements from the remarkable. growth, otherwise the ratio would have looked even a little bit more positive, it has also. been considering the impact from the very, very low interest rates, which is a trigger for. higher capital demand.. So in that regard, if that all holds, then I would say the solvency ratio does consider, if you. then imply that there is a longer term impact in life, where we have potentially our. contracts run 20 years or 30 years or even longer, then of course that would need an. assumption, how long it will be impacted by COVID losses. The same is true for positive. impact on the longevity side, those have not been adjusted yet. And again, if 2021 does. see additional losses again that would only be one year of a long role of Solvency to. future cash flow implications.. I hope that addresses your question.. Thomas Fossard. Yeah. Thank you. Just seeking clarity on that, just because some of your peers are taking. the 12-month view on Solvency II, when one-year solvency calculation. But you make it. clear. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And we do have another question from Vikram Gandhi, Societe. Generale. Your line is now open again.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi. Thank you once again for the opportunity. I've got a conceptual question on life and. health, specifically with respect to the higher assured policies. I think the comment made. was that the net retention by life is [ph]$20 million to $25 million, which is consistent with. what you've said in the past. My understanding is that these policies are generally meant. for the ultra high net worth individuals at all the rate groups, who go for this tax wrapper, if. you like for inheritance tax planning or estate tax planning. However for a policy of say. [ph]$20 million, the premiums should be around [ph]$15 million, $16 million hypothetically.. And so the net amount at risk, if that's the correct technical term to be used, should be. pretty low. So then, why should a couple of claims on these large sum-assured policies be. really a material swing factor for the EBIT is my question.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yeah. I take that. No nobody else volunteered to answer that. When you have a royalty. treaty, you have the risk premium base and there is -- although you're absolutely right,. over the lifetime of the policy, you would expect that somebody pays the amount he. finally gets. But the way how it works on the accounting side from a reinsurance. perspective is that we have the one of T-premium, the risk premium and if somebody. dies, then this is a full claim for us, because there is no reserve, you have to distinguish. between level premium, where you get the same premium over what about the lifetime. of the policy. And then you're absolutely right, but usually this is re-insured on a risk. premium basis.. And then the balance is the diversification in our portfolio, where people don't die and. just pay the premium and one or two might die. But these one or two if we expect, three. of these claims in a year and we have five then it's two more than expected and that is. basically the full amount minus the risk premium of that particular year. This is how the. accounting is done.. Of course it should balance out, but it doesn't have to. Over the long run, it would balance. out, but we don't get level premium every time. And honestly in these days, we don't like. level premium that much because then you have to invest and you have to tell the client. okay, if you give me the level premium, I take into account 3% or 4% of interest return and. nobody makes that these days. So the client is interested to keep the cash and only pay. the risk premium to us.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. So the level premium presumably must be on the coinsurance treaties.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Right. That's great.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.. Operator. And the next question is again from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. again.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Thank you. Very quick one, sorry. Klaus, for life side in the US, are you able to provide. some indication of how much are the older age is in proportion to the population or. something and I'm sorry, you might have commented in another Investor Day, but I can't. seem to recollect that if you have provided that. Thank you.. Klaus Miller. We have about, I think 1.2% of our portfolio is age 80 or older, by amount and if you just. count the lines, then it's only 0.8%. So this is relative to our competitors, I guess a slightly. smaller amount of old age people. Basically due to the fact that in the very early days,. let's say, before 2008, we were not really a big writer and then we bought a broad. portfolio and later on we started writing more business what you will probably know under. the name of the organic business and the organic business is pretty young. And it's. already a large chunk of our portfolio. But we have only written that from 2010 onwards.. And from the broad portfolio as mentioned earlier by me, quite a substantial part of the. YRT treaties of permanent life -- whole of life have been recaptured. So this is why our. share is a little bit smaller here.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you, Klaus.. Operator. And there is another question from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Your line is now open. again.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi there. Two short ones I think, one potentially very short. On the business interruption. assumptions, are you able to say this is quite of live court cases is one particular significant. court case ongoing, are you able to say have you made a sort of risk adjusted assumption. on the outcome of those court cases or I mean, should they go against the industry,. would that necessitate additional reserves, can you give us any sort of more specific color. on that.. And the second question just on ordinary investment income. I wasn't clear, is there a sort. of temporary effect on lower dividends from low returns of private equity and real estate. or I mean, would you consider some catch that there might be some catch-up on that or is. this, should we just adjust ourselves to a permanently lower level of return from those. alternative assets.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Sven?. Sven Althoff. On the business interruption side, we have assumed that there is no retroactive change. of coverage in the United States. So that would not be baked into the EUR240 million I. was mentioning. And for Europe and a few other court cases elsewhere, outside Europe,. we have taken a balanced view. So if all these cases would go against the insurers, then. the EUR240 million number would not be sufficient. If insurers should win all cases. everywhere, than the EUR240 million would be prudent number.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Andrew, with regard to the expectations of the income from alternative vested, I don't. see any reason why this would not recover or even catch up and I'm sure that the private. equity fund might also see opportunities driven by the crisis, because it's uncertain as to. when that will happen, but to now assume that even after a recovery of the economy,. investors will digest or accept lower yields for such exposures doesn't -- wouldn't make. sense to me.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks very much.. Operator. And we have another question from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open again.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Thank you. A very last one, regarding the situation in Lebanon, I made it very early. days, but again that's the level of understanding, we have of this kind of market is pretty. low. So could you shed some light on where and how you would expect losses to hit the. market not -- maybe not Hannover Re specific, but more a high level comment if you have. any. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Well, first and foremost, we're very sorry to see this tragedy happening yesterday and it's. very, very early days, so we don't have an overview when it comes to loss of life or loss of. property at this stage. Of course, the impact for the infrastructure will be massive from an. assured point of view, it's too early to say what is the penetration of insurance in that. particular area, given that it's a harbor, industrial related area, we have to assume that. there is a good level of penetration here. So from that point of view, I guess, you will see. that on our major loss list in the third quarter, but I would have no feel at this stage to. what extent this will be a major losses. It will be a major loss for us, I see us pretty certain,. but whether it's a low double-digit or high double-digit or even three-digit number, it. would be impossible for me to comment right now.. Andrew Ritchie. Sure. Thank you.. Operator. And there are no further questions at this point. So I hand back to the speakers for closing. remarks.. Jean-Jacques Hencho. Well, thank you very much for your participation and your questions. I think we covered the. ground very well. We wanted to give you the latest updates on our best estimates on the. exposure on COVID-19. We tried to be very cautious, looking at client information, market. information, our old portfolio bottom up view, still difficult to predict we said there are still. remaining uncertainties. But at this stage, our best estimate is that this will be an earnings. event for Hannover Re in 2020. The underlying business is very strong, as we discussed,. and we're very confident about the quality of the portfolio and the outlook is positive. We. have price momentum particularly in P&C. We have growth opportunities and a strong. pipeline in structured reinsurance. And I think the flight to quality phenomenon continues. to give us additional life science, so that's I think the key messages for today. But thank. you very much for your attention and participation and have a good day.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect.",20200805_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2020-8-5_DN000000002880131778.pdf,2020-08-05
11,"Well. Good morning to all of you. Welcome to Hannover Re's Investors' Day 2017. I'm really. delighted that so many of you were able to take up our invitation. This is the 20th. Investors' Day that we held today. And although, it doesn't feel like a birthday party. But. it's a great pleasure to have you all here and to mark with us this occasion. So a very warm. welcome here in Frankfurt. I was also pleased that so many of you managed to attend. yesterday evening's dinner at the Deutsche Film Museum. We had certainly hoped, that. you might find the venue interesting. After all, there are some elements that you show in. your own studies and have something in common with a good movie or a novel. Such as a. compelling story, edge of the seats tension, colorful characters, striking originality. And. last but not least a catchy title.. As if we could possibly forget just how creative you are, we need to only remind ourself. of the titles of recently published notes on the industry or on Hannover Re, in particular.. Just a few examples: Gone with the wind, was one of them or blame him, pricing the term. or in the eye of the storm. And I don't mind admitting a special favorite of mine, which. was, this time it's different. I only missed the word somewhat. I can only congratulate to. you on the creativity you displayed in pursuit of your goal, namely, getting investors. excited about the reinsurance business. That said, yesterday evening was truly. unforgettable, a great atmosphere and a marvelous location. I certainly, won't forget. some of the pictures we have taken nor will I be posting them on the social network. A. very big thank you, to Katherine and Julia for their choice of the venue. You both devoted. so much energy and care in putting everyone together. Even though, once again, we find. ourselves in the presence of a stage, cameras and (lightening). And I'm very much aware. that the contrast compared to yesterday could hardly be greater. Our program today is. free of fictional elements. The content we are in no way fixtures nor are the cost actors.. Quite the contrary, everything that we have to tell you today, asked to be taken seriously.. And it will be presented live and in color by Hannover Re's A-list celebrities. Best of all,. there won't be any commercial breaks, by the way.. The storybook, we have to assemble is, at least in our eyes, breathtakingly fascinating. In. no small measure, it reflects the inspiration we have gained from your comments and. feedbacks on previous occasions and in past conversations. And when the clapper board. claps for the final time, this afternoon, we will look forward for your feedback and. comments on today's program.. You will find the feedback form on your desk. I cannot emphasize enough, how highly. value the -- your feedback and remarks are. Before I say action, I would like to make a few. organizational remarks. The cameras are going to webcast all the presentations and the. Q&A sessions, of course. Some colleagues have already locked in to follow the day's. events online. The stream will be available on our Hannover Re website so that you can. replay the best scenes, at a later date as often as you wish. But this in mind, during the. Q&A, please wait for the microphones. So everybody gets to hear your question in the. best high-fidelity sound quality. The access key for a free Wi-Fi is on our desk, as always,. together with a modest gift. The boost from this power bar will hopefully leave you or at. least your electronic devices feeling energized and reloaded. It also has a rather nice. Bluetooth surprise built-in. But I'm sure you will find out. Please consider this as a token of. our appreciation for the participation today and the support that you have shown to. Hannover Re and the Investor Relations team in -- for many years.. On that note, I would like to welcome our CEO Ulrich Wallin to the stage. Ulrich, the floor. is yours.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Karl. And thanks for reminding me that I should be serious, let me try it.. Yes. Well you see our new title. Or I should say good morning, first, I guess, because I was. asked to be serious. And I will be. Yes. Good morning to all, warm welcome from me as. well. And I appreciate you all coming. And I share Karl's views on the venue yesterday. evening, even though, I missed taking a picture of myself, let it be taken on the red. carpet. But that's not so important, I guess. So we will start our strategy revision for the. years 2018 to 2020. Because as you know, we have a strategic cycle, where every three. years, we look at our strategy. And that of course, starts with a look at the market. conditions as a whole. So what is the -- I mean pond we're swimming in? What's our. universe of business we are transacting? And that is of course, the reinsurance business.. And therefore, its, of course, for us it's important to understand, how the reinsurance. business is developing? Who are the players? How are the markets look like? What you. can see here is the P&C reinsurance market and its developments since 2012. And you. can see that the market has grown not dramatically. But a little bit. You can also see that. there is a kind of, I mean, fly to the larger reinsurers. So the top 10 reinsurers have. increased their market share over time to the detriment particular of the -- all the smaller. reinsurance companies. So their market share, actually, by premium has actually been. reduced over time. But you can also see that the P&C market is still very fragmented. So. you have very many players, hundreds of players in that market and that of course,. includes all the facilities, is that under right on -- based on a collateralized basis so the ILS. market. They are largely in the all as a category.. If it comes to Hannover Re, you can see that we managed over time to increase our. market share. So in rough terms, we increased from 4% to 5%. And of course, we. achieved that by growing faster than the market. And that is, for us, important because. we feel that our position is one of the lead market. Over time, we should be able to. increase our market share. This 5-year periods that are displayed here, of course, are -- is. a 5-year period of a softening market. I mean. So the -- of those five years, the highest. rating quality we had in 2012. And the lowest rating quality we had in 2016. But you can. see that partly the growth of course, will also be driven by, I mean, more advantageous. prices to the ceding companies. I mean, the fragmentation of the market also tells you,. that the entrants hurdle into the P&C reinsurance market is not particularly high. I always. say, you just need an office in Bermuda, you take a few gray-haired guys and take $1. billion. And you are up and running to write P&C business through the brokers. At the. same time, the set business model, it's not that easy to enter the top 10. It takes time.. And therefore, there is a little bit more stability in this market, than you will assume from. the low entrance hurdle. But at the same time, I mean, it is a structurally competitive. market.. If you then come to the Life & Health business, the other field, where we are active. You. can see that it has grown a little bit more pronounced, as that partly also has to do with. the currency conversion. Because this is all measured in euros. And I think you probably. remember that the euro gained in value quite a bit in 2015. And this is of course, part of. the growth. But needless to say, the Life & Health market is growing at a slightly larger. pace than the P&C market. You can also see that the market is a lot more concentrated. than the P&C market. We see top 10 players having almost all of the business, apart from. some local players, it was 94%. And the reason for that is that, contrary to the P&C. business, which is driven by the new and renewal business, particularly, the life part of the. Life & Health business is driven by the in force, due to the long-term duration of the. underlying policies.. You can also see that, I mean, Hannover Re basically have grown pretty much with the. market, maybe a little bit smaller than the market. But kept our market share unchanged.. This on Life & Health is sometimes a good guide, sometimes a bad guide, because there. are still quite a lot of herds of business in our financial solution practice, which is deposit. accounted. And therefore, it's not visible in the top line, that has been displayed here. So. this is a market by premium and by premium volume. But of course, even more important. is the bottom line, rather than the top line. And if you look at the bottom line, this is the -what you see here is the EBIT of the top 5 reinsurers on the P&C side. These numbers are. relatively easily to be collated because you just look at the balance sheet of the 5 largest. reinsurers, which happened to be all publicly quoted. So you have information available.. I mean, the profit pool of the entire market that is estimated here is EUR 20 billion to EUR. 25 billion. That is a little bit more difficult to assess. And in fact, the numbers that we have. taken here is extrapolated from the top 5. And it assumes that the profitability of the. entire market is similar to the profitability of the top 5, which tells you that the -- it's a. profit pool, which we here estimate this EUR 20 billion to EUR 25 billion is rather an. optimistic view, most likely. So you better look at the lower part of the bracket. And then. you can see that we are in a EUR 20 billion business. And that's of course, what we try to. grow, is our participation in that profit pool, that's what we consider to be -- what we. consider to mean growth of market share. You can see that we've been at least as a. percentage of their profit pool, relatively successful throughout the soft market years. If. you look at our participation and the profit pool of the 5 largest reinsurers, we managed. to increase that from 12% to 17%. And which is also quite reassuring, as that is, the growth. of the bottom line, outpace the growth of the top line, which of course, is for us quite,. quite important.. Well I mean, that's something, which for us, as I said is quite important. You can also see. that due to the soft market environment, the overall profit development of the reinsurers. on the P&C side has not been overly exciting. If you look at the Life & Health side, the. situation is a little bit more favorable or quite a bit more favorable, when it comes to the. development of the profits. Again, here we take the profits of the top 5 reinsurers. But of. course, differently than with P&C on the Life & Health, that captures the majority of the. business. And you can also see that the profit pool of the Life & Health is about 20% of. the profit pool on the P&C side. You can also see that the EBIT margin that on average is. achieved on P&C is around 10% to 12.5%, whilst on life & Health is more about 5% to 6%.. So it is a Life & Health is a business, which is a slimmer margin as a percentage of. premium. But of course, also the capital bound by that business is also lower than it is with. the P&C side, because it is less volatile.. If you look at our numbers, I mean, we kept our participation of the profit pool of the top. 5 reinsurers stable. And again, our profitability increased in line with the growth of the. premium. And this is despite the fact that, particular in the more recent year, we saw. some problems with our mortality solutions business in the U.S. and after the coffee. break, I will give you some more insight into that.. If you look at the market, as a whole, you can see that both the insurance and the. reinsurance market is growing. Don't be confused that we have different market sizes of. the reinsurance and in the previous slides. This is just a different top-down assessment.. And the truth is presumably somewhere in the middle. But directionally, it's -- that's what's. happening. The reinsurance market grows at a smaller pace than the insurance market.. But it does grow. And the average session rate. So the percentage of the primary. premium that is transferred to the reinsurers is around just under 10%. So around 1/10th of. the premium is being ceded to reinsurers. I would say in and large, I mean, that is. certainly, less than the primary markets pay for distribution. But that's where we are. So it's. a much smaller market than the insurance market. And it's a slower growing market than. the insurance market.. If I come to the Life & Health side. On the Life & Health business, you can see that, there. is -- the growth is stalling a little bit on the primary insurance market. That of course, has. to do with the low interest rate environments, that many of the savings products that are. prevailing in the Life & Health business, particularly in the life business have become less. attractive to the customer. And therefore, the growth has not been quite as pronounced. as it was in the past. On the contrary, on the reinsurance side, there you see a slightly. more pronounced growth. And the reason for that is, that on the reinsurance side in and. large, we are not dealing with the savings part of the business. But we are dealing with. the biometric risk. And therefore, we see somewhat more pronounced growth in the. reinsurance market than in the insurance market. The cession rate, which on the P&C side. was about 10%, on Life & Health is only about 3%. And the reason for that low cession. rate, largely of course, is because we are not participating as a reinsurer in the savings. part of the policies.. So that gives you a little bit on the universe we are working in. For us, of course,. strategically, a basic question, is this a good business to be in? Or should we take our. money and do something else with it? And I'll be coming on that in a minute. When we. approached our strategy revision, this time, we were looking at the strategic alternatives,. because there are always alternatives to everything. And of course, strategy is to decide,. which option you want to go and to which option you don't want to go. There are things. like, shall we, I mean, broaden our pond we are swimming in. So shall we like most of our. competitors do, enter the primary market? Like question, shall we be the Ryanair of the. reinsurance, a low-cost provider. I mean, Ryanair is quite successful until recently. So I can't. say this with that much confidence any longer, or shall we just be more efficient? Those. kind of questions, we are asking ourselves. And as that are depicted here. And I would. come to those. This gives you our strategic cycle. I mean, the basis why we relook of our. strategy every three years, of course, is the changes in our market environment. So time. changes, market participant changes, market dynamics change. And of course, we have. to adapt our strategy according to that.. And I should also dwell a little bit on our headline, which here is named our vision, which is. creating value through reinsurance. As you know since the last 10 years, about we start to. give our strategy cycles headlines, like we have to, I mean, being sustainable, successful. in a competitive business. We are growing Hannover Re profitably. And this time, we say. creating values through reinsurance. But that really should say, that we see reinsurance as. an attractive field to be in. And that reinsurance is our core business. That's the message. we want to give, in particular, to our clients. And therefore, we came up with this headline.. But is reinsurance really an attractive business to be in? And there are few considerations.. First of all, we feel that reinsurance is a valuable product for our clients. For many reasons,. one of course, is that you can improve as an insurer, your cost of capital by buying. reinsurance. And reinsurance is the only way to do that with a 1-year contract. If you want. to improve your cost of capital by taking out hybrid capital, you're at least bound for 10. years, any shorter duration would not give you the capital credit. And the other thing,. which makes reinsurance attractive when it comes to capital management, it affects the. capital required rather than the capital that we have. In Solvency II terms, it can reduce the. SCR. And therefore, it's quite efficient, if you want to improve your cost of capital and the. amount of profit stream, you can write this -- with this business.. Secondly, of course, you can, I mean, reduce the volatility of your earnings as the primary. insurer. And this probably is the most common reason why reinsurance is being. purchased, because stakeholders in insurance companies, like in other corporation, don't. like volatile earnings. For the most part, they like to see rather stable development of the. earnings and ideally going to the top right of the graph. And also, of course, you can. benefit as an insurer from the experience of your reinsurer when it comes to enter into. new products or into new lines of business where you haven't been before in. So we feel. it's an attractive value proposition to the insurance industry. We also feel that the structure. and the way reinsurance is being bought as a business to business. This professionals of. the same profession so to say, is structurally quite different to the way insurance is being. bought.. There is still growth in the market. And the growth in the market is of course, because it's. an attractive proposition. And therefore, we are not in a shrinking market, if we are active. in the reinsurance field. At the same time, due to the fact that writing a global reinsurance. book is a lot less onerous from a regulatory point of view than writing a global insurance. book. Reinsurance is structurally a competitive business. That's particularly true for the. P&C business that the entrants hurdle is low. And distribution is easy through the. reinsurance brokers. So we will have to live with the fact, that there will always be a. directionally more supply than demand for the product. However, it's a rational. competition. And the reason that the competition is rational in reinsurance is because, the. players in the reinsurance field are largely publicly quoted on investment funds when it. comes to the ILS markets. Therefore, none of us or hardly any of us, maybe some stateowned entity is a different story. But then see players that are most influential on the. reinsurance markets cannot tolerate losses for an extended period. Because if earnings. become unsatisfactory, as the management of the reinsurance companies and the ILS. funds come under pressure from their stakeholders. And therefore, stakeholders and. shareholders. And therefore, they have to do something about it.. As a consequence and we have seen that in the past, we can expect that reinsurance. terms and conditions will increase after bad results in the reinsurance market. And of. course, the question is, what does that mean for us? For market players that are -- can. develop competitive advantages. So we being better in a competition, more successful in. the competition than the average player in the market, reinsurance offers the opportunity. for profitable growth. And due to that conclusion, we feel that reinsurance is a business. we should be in and where we can be successful, like we have been in the past.. Of course, that basic question, as I said, you need to have competitive advantages in that. business, to be sustainably successful. How are we, as Hannover Re, positioned in that. market? Are we positioned in that market, that we can be successful or not? And you will. not be surprised, if I tell you that our conclusion has been, that we're well positioned in. that market.. Firstly, we belong to the top 3 reinsurers worldwide. So we're top-tier reinsurer. And as. you have seen at the beginning of my presentation, the growth of the top reinsurers. outpaces the market. So there we are in the right place. And it is actually true to say that. size matters in reinsurance. Because the ceding companies have a buyers wanting to. place their business with the larger reinsurers. Also, the demands of the insurance. companies towards their reinsurers is for more holistic coverage because it's more. efficient, when it comes to capital optimization in solvency regimes, such as Solvency II or. similar risk-based solvency regimes. Such multi-class multi-territory covers, of course, are. easier to buy from the reinsurer that is active in all those classes and territories. And. rather than buying from a number of smaller specialty niche players. Therefore, it's a value. in belonging to the largest reinsurers.. Very tangible advantage that we have to our competitors, is our lower expense ratio,. lower admin expense ratio, also lower total expense ratio, including acquisition cost that. allows us to be competitive. More competitive than our competition. And still being able. to create a good margin for our shareholders.. Being cost-efficient is not everything. But it's an important element of being competitive.. We have consistent underwriting approach that also has to do with the fact that we have. particularly in Hannover Re relatively low fluctuation ratio of our employees. And we have. very long-standing client relationship, some of them date back decades. That helps,. because reinsurance still is a people's business, it's a relationship business. And. therefore, here we clearly have an advantage compared to any new entrant to the. market.. Of course, we have certification between Life & Health and P&C business, which should. allow us to write a larger profits stream on the same capital base compared to. competitors that either write P&C only or Life & Health only. And we of course, compared. to those, we have an opportunity to have better return on equities. And well, I mean, we. have of course, we offer tailor-made solutions to our clients, we also of course, pride. ourselves of being solution minded and execution-focused. All in all, we feel that. Hannover Re is well positioned to compete successfully in the reinsurance market, which. is our chosen field of activity. Of course, when we look at our strategy, we also have to. look what our competitors do? What the other market participants do? Because we. cannot assume that we are much more clever than them. Therefore, for us it's important. to understand, how their business model looks. And in recent years in particular, we have. seen that many of our competitors have broadened their universe of the business, they. are in by being more active in the insurance, rather than in the reinsurance business. For. us, of course, that begs the question, shall we go the same route? And shall we also see. insurance and reinsurance as, I mean, business as which we give equal weight to in. Hannover Re. Of course, by concentrating on reinsurance, we have -- we still see that we. can generate good earnings, particularly with our position. And I think I have explained that. on the previous slides. And if you concentrate on reinsurance, we also feel that we have 1. advantage, that we are not competing with our clients. And I also have to admit that being. part of the Talanx group, which I was told has some reinsurance, some insurance. somewhere. We would not be well-suited to compete with them fiercely in the insurance. field.. The fact that we are not competing with our clients, we see that little bit more in our. business relationship with some of our major clients who are interested to work more with. us as a reinsurer, not competing with them, compared to some of our peers. And that of. course, is a good opportunity for us to increase our involvement with some of them,. where we know the business and where we can see that the business is favorable for us. from a profitability point of view. Conclusion of that is that, reinsurance remains a core. business of Hannover Re. We have some involvement in the insurance field as well. But. this is seen not as equally important than our reinsurance activity. But at seeing as a. complement, complementing our core business and we write a limited amount of primary. business in 2 areas. One would be coinsurance business on large commercial accounts,. which is quite similar to our facultative business from a structure point of view. And we. also write some niche business through partners, particular agencies and underwriting. agencies. And distribution channels, which is business that is generally not reinsured.. What does that mean for our business model? It is our aim to expand our market share in. the reinsurance field, which is our core business. We feel over the long to medium-term -medium to long-term we are in the position to do that. And if we are talking increasing. market share, of course, the aim is to increase our share in the profit pool that the. reinsurance market offers to us. Also, within the reinsurance business, we have a broad. focus. We focus all lines, all territories. We want to write all the business that fulfills our. margin requirements. The reason for that is, if we would have, which we also could do,. the approach of a specialist reinsurer that would of course, narrow our focus in the. reinsurance field, which already is only like 6% of the insurance market. And we feel, as a. specialist, on parts of the reinsurance segment, focused reinsurer, he will not be able to. be one of the leading reinsurers, which as I told you before, we attribute a value of -- in. being one of the leading reinsurers. Therefore, broad approach on the reinsurance. And. primary only in selective niche markets. We continue. And we will continue to write both. Life & Health and P&C reinsurance to generate the diversification benefits. And as we. see, profit opportunities for us in both business groups. We will maintain our cost. advantage, despite the fact that it needs a constant effort. And we are solutionorientated reinsurer. So we want to create value with our clients by giving them innovative. solutions that allows them to be more successful than they would be when they would not. deal with us. And of course, we have developed a digital strategy, not only because it's. quite fashionable to do that. But also because digitalization will have a major influence. also on our business.. These are our strategic principles, which I will dwell on rather briefly looking at the time.. First one is our profit goals. And economic growth targets. And of course, we crystallized. those in the target metrics. And we have made some changes to the target metrics.. Some realizing that the economic numbers are gradually becoming more important in. relation versus the IFRS numbers, because up until recently, our stakeholders were mainly. judging the success or failure of our activities based on the IFRS group numbers. But since. Solvency II has been enacted. And we also publicizing the economic capital adequacy ratio. or economic capital ratio, the economic numbers have become more to the forefront.. And we felt that we should also recognize that with our growth targets. So the valuecreation, which previously we had based on the IFRS, we now base that on the change in. the economic capital as depicted in our internal model plus the dividend. And we added,. as a group target, the solvency ratio of 200% as a target, which is a threshold where the. limit is 200%.. IFRS 3, since you see here a downward arrows is only due to the fact that the interest. rates are continuing to decrease because it's an average interest rate over five years.. And that is still coming down. The reduced interest rate is also the main reason why we. took the earnings per share growth target down from 6.5% to 5%. The return on. investment is stable at -- sorry, 7.5%, that would be great, 2.7% and Roland will tell you. later that there is a stabilization in our expected return on investment despite the fact that. we have a continued low-interest rate environment.. On the P&C side, all targets unchanged. And on the Life & Health side, we all now see IVC. targets and growth target (inaudible). And instead of having an EBIT margin target, we. changed it to an EBIT growth target. That has to do due to the fact that with deposit. accounted treaties and some other particularities of the Life & Health business, we feel. that the EBIT growth target is more telling than an EBIT margin target.. Second, of course, for us to be successful, it's quite important to be a preferred business. partner of our client. And of course, here our credit rating helps and we pride ourself of. best execution within our peer group. And this is also due to the fact that we have no. matrix organization. But we give the power of decision to the client-facing underwriter.. And that allows us to execute all the complex transactions more timely and with a higher. certainties than some of our competitors.. Services we provide. But we are not providing unbundled services. But services that we. provide should be strictly linked to business opportunities where we generate premiums. and profit streams.. Being a service provider, our employees are most important for us. And we think we are. best, best -- we have the best success as a company if our employees are successful.. Therefore, we strive this in Hannover Re to have a corporate culture where the individual. employee can experience success in their day-to-day business. And that also has to do. with the fact that we delegate decision taking to the -- to our employees and not have a. matrix organization. Of course, we have controls in place regarding that decision taking of. our employees. You can also see that we have a wide variety of specialists that we need. to write our reinsurance business, such as medical doctors, we have engineers, we have. mathematicians and a few other professions. But what we feel that increasingly we will. also need skilled profiles that allow us to be successful in a more digitalized world.. As far as our investment strategy, the broad questions that we asked ourselves when we. set up the strategy: Shall we go to a hedge-fund-style reinsurance? To say, for us, the. assets have a higher value than for our competition because we could generate higher. return. Or should we continue with the conservative strategy where we say what if you. invest in Hannover Re, you get an insurance company rather than an investment fund. And. we decided that we will stay with the traditional measured risk strategy and not trying to. generate significant alphas through high-risk taking on our assets.. Risk management. Of course, we defined in our risk strategies the risk position that we. want to take. And that, of course, defines all the distribution of our capital to the various. activities and subsegments. And in the end, to the individual treaty is all based on the risk. position that we define for Hannover Re. The risk position is defined by the solvency ratio. of at least 180% versus 200% threshold. It is defined by a ruin probability of 0.03%. So 1 in. every 3,333 years, we tolerate to be bankrupt. And it is also defined by a probability of. with a AA rating.. That is also then, of course, the starting point for our risk strategy and for our risk. management activities.. Capital management is, for us, very important. Of course, we want to have sufficient. amount of capital first and foremost that we fulfill the expectations of our clients. That's. very important because only if the clients feel that we give them a secured promise to. pay, only then they will place their long tail and also their best business. So that's very. important for us. Second, we, of course, we need to fulfill the regulatory requirements. and the rating agency requirements for our desired ratings. And we also need to have. some more capital than just fulfilling those requirements because we want to have capital. available to enlarge our use of capital in case that, let's say, our market opportunities.. On the other side, of course, we want to generate attractive ROEs. So we only want to. have that much capital that is in line with the profit that we can generate so that we have. an attractive ROE compared to our peers. And of course, that is achieved by below. average cost of capital. And of course, if we have higher ROEs and higher rate of. profitability, we are seen as a successful corporation, which for us is important. Of course,. for our shareholders, it is important. But also for our clients and for all our employees.. Because also for the employees, it's more attractive to work with a successful corporation. than with an unsuccessful corporation. And also our clients preferred to place their. business in successful corporations rather than unsuccessful corporations.. What are the tools that we are using in order to reduce the cost of capital we use? Hybrid. capital and retrocessions. And in order to manage our capital, the size of our capital, we. use special dividends. The use of special dividends has been newly introduced to our. strategy. Here you can see it.. Then, on the expenses, you can see that our expense ratio is still significantly lower than. the expense ratio of our peers -- the average expense ratio of our peers. And you can. see that this is true both for the expense ratio, including distribution expenses as well as. expense ratio of the industry is actually trending downwards. But the average commission. ratios have trended upwards. And this, of course, has to do with the softening market.. been more geared towards proportionate reinsurance rather than nonproportionate. That brings me to our IT strategy. We want to generate an efficient support of our. same reinsurance administration system in most of our locations worldwide, in all the. locations that write close to 80% of our premium. And this allows us to generate quite a. lot of efficiencies, particular when it comes to the new and ever-increasing reporting. requirements if we have to regulate us and other stakeholders.. We also have created a digital strategy, 2 goals there: one, generate new business,. reinsuring start-ups of these so-called InsurTechs, supporting our clients along the value. chain with digital solutions and writing the new risks, such as cyber and understanding the. silent cyber as it is called more thoroughly. And of course, increase efficiencies of our own. processes. And we have initiated a few projects to become even more efficient than in. the past.. Sustainability and compliance, for us, very important. Again, for reasons, we want to be a. good corporate citizen. We want to meet the requirements of our clients. There are more. and more clients that have a sustainability strategy of themselves. They expect the same. from their service providers. We want to be investigable for investors that look for. environmental or socially responsible companies. And we want to be an attractive. employer. And in order to achieve that, we are also prepared to forgo short-term profit to. make sure that is actually a serious effort that we are doing in this respect. And the tool to. put our strategy in action is our performance excellence management system where each. of the units, each department, each subsidiary, each brand has to define the contribution. to the strategy. They also have to define the KPIs for executing the strategy. All that is. done through what we call a strategy cockpit, which is a nice IT system that also allows us. sufficient to achieve our strategic goals as a group.. With that, I would conclude my presentation and look forward to your questions. Thank. you very much.. Questions And Answers. Karl Steinle. I'm sure you have some questions. But please wait for the microphone, which will be. handed by (Andrea) and (Catherine). The first one from Frank Kopfinger.. Frank Kopfinger. My question would be on the additional strategy. Can you be a little bit more precise here. in respect to how many InsurTechs you already back in this respect? Are we only talking. about reinsurance capacity? Or are you also acting as a investor in these InsurTechs? Then. on the other part, on the IT investments overall to digitalize your reinsurance business. model, can you provide us with a figure as to how much you have set in IT budget that. you are going to spend towards this impact going forward the numbers?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Firstly, on the InsurTechs, I would say we reinsure a handful of them, maybe, 2. handfuls. That's, of course, one of our strategies. If there are new risk carriers, they are, of. course, potential clients. And that's what we are looking at. We, of course, also support. them with our know-how and our resources. We also invest in some of them. We have. investments, for example, in the U.S., where we invest in one of the Silicon Valley. InsurTechs, like, Sureify. We also, in Germany, for example, we work with (Finley), which is a. business built in Berlin. And (is there) we have an investment. And we also have. investments in specific startups. So it's a little bit of both. But always there's a few of. improving, I mean, generating business and generating reinsurance business for. Hannover Re.. Expenses. While for us as we -- where we improve our own systems that's part of our. overall IT budget. But of course, there is an increasing number for digitalization. For. example, we developed a point-of-sale system in Germany for the Life & Health business.. And we invested in this EUR 20 million. But this will not increase our expense ratio. dramatically. And one of the reason is that we are -- there's a difference between. reinsurance and insurance, in particular personal lines insurance. Because in the insurance,. of course, the number of transactions is very, very high. So complete automatization of. the end-to-end processes is absolutely crucial to continue to be competitive in this. business. In the reinsurance side, of course, the number of transaction is lot less.. Therefore, the automation is easier to achieve. And is less, less competitive. It's a smaller. competitive factor. That said, we, for example, are looking for our Bermuda nonlife. company to see if we -- to what extent we can automate the entire end-to-end. processes. And the reason that we took Bermuda, it's a relatively small organization with. something like 27 employees. But they have all the processes. I mean, they have. underwriting, they have pricing, they have modeling. And of course, then they have cash. accounting, balance sheet accounting. And of course, technical accounting. So it is really. like from an automation point of view -- I mean, it's really like a sandbox. So from that. point of view, we have taken that.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Next question coming from Kamran. And then we follow with Vinit.. Kamran Hossain. Just 1 question on the target matrix, the EPS growth target for 2018 and onwards. Can you. just talk us through what the starting point for that 5% or above greater is that 2017. adjusted for hurricanes or kind of what that says? Then in terms of your assumptions built. into that, what are we thinking on premium growth and the kind of future opportunities. going into next year? It seems like there might be some kind of change in the market. Is. any of that baked into your assumptions on the 5%-plus EPS growth?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, the growth target is just developed by our premium growth targets and our. margin requirements. And that, of course, is harmonized with the 96% target combined. ratio or below 96%. And of course, in Life & Health not very simple because we have a 5%. EBIT growth targets there as well. So that should, of course, translate in a 5% increase as. well. But this is just taken out of the various numbers that you see in the target matrix and. the idea is that they are to harmonize them so that if you achieve the premium growth. we have a higher interest rate that in itself taken -- if the technical targets are unchanged. would create a larger growth of the EPS because the assets under management are. it's just trying to harmonize the targets within the target matrix. Of course, I mean, if we. would try for 10% increase in top line, keeps the same margin requirement, of course, we. would then also have higher growth targets. Conversely, if we want to have no growth. targets, there could also be no growth targets of the EPS if the profit margin generated is. stable. Then when it comes to 2018 -- I mean, 2017, it's unlikely that we will achieve an EPS. growth. And we, of course, we guided that already. Because with the hurricane losses. likely to exceed the large loss budget that would, of course, mean that one of the. preconditions for our profit guidance is in danger or may not be met, which is -- that the. large losses remain within the budget. But if they are excess of the budget, it has a. negative influence on the earnings per share. So that is something I have say for 2017. For. 2018, of course, we are expecting, on the P&C side, a better trading conditions, which, of. course, then should mean that the EPS growth in 2018. Again, if the large losses behave. and the capital markets behave, we should, of course, for 2018, on a stand-alone basis,. the EPS growth should be double-digit, partly also because 2017 will be below. expectation.. Vinit Malhotra. Vinit from Mediobanca. Just clarifying again, all these downgraded matrix numbers, do. they include any optimism from your side on what the hurricane opportunities would be or. cat opportunities could be? Or are these just a base case. And then, we have to top it up. with what we imagine you could do? So that's the first question. Second question is just on. Slide 18. Again, it's linked to that. We know that you look at NatCat capacity as a. percentage in terms of risk capital, which used to be 18%. Is that going to change going. forward?. Ulrich Wallin. First of all, you see the target matrix is a base case. That said, the target combined ratio. is, of course, more a combined ratio over the cycle. We feel that we can achieve that. combined ratio every year if the large losses behave because in those years where we. are able to achieve better technical results -- at least, in the past, we have built up the. redundancies and our loss reserves. And that allows us to keep the technical result stable. even in a soft market. For 2018, of course, we feel that the market condition should be. sufficient to generate our desired profits without resulting to taking out of the redundancy. buffers. As far as the natural catastrophe budget is concerned, as we have excess capital,. we're quite flexible on that. I mean, we could increase that as we feel fit. For the time. being, we haven't changed the large loss budget and the national catastrophe budget for. next year, mainly because it's an evolving situation. And we have to see 2 things. First of. all, to what extent can we continue to place our retrocession contract. And to what extent. we are actually will be seeing rate increases on the property cat side. So later, we are. pretty sure -- and therefore, it is relatively likely that by year-end, you will see that we. have increased our national catastrophe budget to some extent.. Karl Steinle. Well Paris, take the microphone.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Paris from CrÃ©dit Suisse. Sorry, I'm going again back to the target matrix and looking at. EBIT growth for Life & Health, where you've changed that from an EBIT margin. Can you. give some details on the split by sharp business, let's say. So I think you have alluded to. the fact that financial solutions business, for example, are doing better. Are you expecting. that EBIT growth is coming mainly from financial solutions rather than mortality or U.S.. a special dividend is integrated into the new strategy. I'm not exactly sure how you define. now an ordinary dividend versus a special dividend. So at what point would you be not. willing to pay a special dividend? Basically, would that be a payout ratio above 100 or. something else?. Ulrich Wallin. Second question, first. We would not pay a special dividend if we cannot finance a. dividend out of the IFRS profitability. So -- I mean, if IFRS profitability is below our dividend. including special, then, of course, we would not pay a special. We would also if we don't. make money or if you have a loss, we will not pay a special dividend. Because you need to. see 2 things here: one is the continuity of the dividend. The continuity of the dividend. should under all circumstances be the base dividend. And in most of the years, we should. be able to pay a special dividend. The other thing is that we would also not pay a special. dividend if there are extraordinary good opportunities to grow our business, like, for. example, if we have opportunities like we have seen in 2002, the significant profitable. growth opportunities. In that case, we would also not pay a special dividend. But we don't. think that 2018 will be similar to 2002. Of course, when we go to the first question. regarding the split of the EBIT growth on the various subsegments, it, of course, applies. to all subsegments, admittedly if I look on U.S. mortality from a rather low base and if I. look at U.S. financial solutions from a higher base. But I can tell you that our ambitions on. the financial solution business is more a double-digit EBIT growth every year. Otherwise,. of course, as it's relative target now, it's -- I mean, it applies to all subsegments.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Any further questions? If this is not the case, we will break now for a short coffee. break. And we will resume at 10:30 for the next presentation.. (Break). +++presentation. We will take a look at the current hurricane season and discuss our activities in relation to. our ING portfolio. And with that, I hand over.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Thank you. First, one remark on the target matrix because this is not getting any. better. And on the target matrix -- because the target matrix is not a guidance for next. year. It's a mid-term target. It's our mid-term target. So the aim is, if we look back on a 10;. or 15-year period or 5; or 10-year period and look at the development of our earnings and. premiums, they should be within the targets of the target matrix. It's not a target that we. expect to achieve in any given year but it's mid-term target. So I mean, if you have a soft. P&C market, for example, we have no ambition to grow by 3% to 5%. If the market is very. soft, we may as well shrink our P&C book. However, if the market is very favorable, we, of. course, aim to grow more than 3% to 5%. So it's a mid-term target that I meant here.. When it comes to 2018, of course, it remains what we set all along that the underlying. profitability that we are able with our business model to generate is more than EUR 1. billion net income. That we already said that the last couple of years. And that hasn't. changed. Again, this is not a profit guidance either.. So that brings me now to the issues. And I start with an update on the natural catastrophe. losses, which have been much talked about. And of course, let's look at the losses of the. Third Quarter. Of course, we have Hurricane Harvey, which was the first one in August.. And you can see that the estimates on Harvey are quite wide ranging. I mean, the lowest. estimate is from CoreLogic, $7.5 billion and it goes up to $40 billion on our math. And. same is true with Irma that $25 billion is the lowest number, $55 billion is the highest. number. And of course, the largest is currency we have on Hurricane Maria, where the. numbers go -- anywhere from $15 billion to $85 billion. So you can see there is a lot of. uncertainty in the final -- in those 3 numbers on all of these. That means that if you take it. all together, we have a range here from $49 billion to $183 billion. The 2 sides of the. equation have very, very different consequences for the market. If we are at $183 billion,. that would mean that assuming 50% of this being reinsured, we would have 45 additional. loss ratio points to the P&C business, which, of course, clearly would be a capital event. rather than an earnings event for the market. Because if you assume that the large loss -the expected large loss -- expected large losses for the market are just under 10%, it. would add about 35, I mean, combined ratio points -- to the target combined ratios. And. yes, I mean, that would not -- you would not be able to bridge that investment income.. Conversely, the lower end of that bracket is $49 billion. You are pretty much in the range,. as I said, we have seen, say, in 2016 and in previous years. So then -- I mean, it would. clearly be only an earnings event and pretty much the losses, if that's the case, would be. covered within the large loss budget, the majority of the losses. So you can see there is a. very high range of uncertainty in these. And also, this uncertainty gives you uncertainty. about the market reactions.. What does that mean for us? We still feel it's a little bit early to give you concrete. numbers. The only thing, which we already said and said remains true is that our profit. target is under threat, under challenge. So to say, because of the combination of the large. losses and particular about this potentially happening in the Fourth Quarter, I mean, could. clearly result in the fact that our large loss budget is not sufficient to cover the actual large. losses. And as I said before, that is one of the preconditions for our profit guidance.. We will, however, give you numbers when we report on our Third Quarter figures because. we have to book numbers. Then if we book the numbers, we may as well give them to. you.. Well I mean, we have comprehensive retrocession cover. And the way we currently look at. the losses, the majority of those retrocessions will still be in place. What that means is our. current assessment is very well safeguarded for further increase in future because if the. losses increase further from our -- from the current assessment of the market or our. assessment, then our retrocession cover would come into play to reduce the effect that,. that would have on Hannover Re. And of course, we expect for us and we are pretty. certain that this will be an earnings issue rather than a capital issue.. Then of course, the question is what does that do for the market? And how does this look. in comparison to what happened in the past? If you look at this chart, you can see that you. have had in the last 17 years, about every 5 to six years, you had a year with major cat. losses. And it's also quite interesting. But this is just the chance that the large losses were. normally preceded by a year with already losses that were slightly above the long-term. average.. And so from that point of view, we can compare 2017 a little bit with 2011 and 2005. because the quantum of loss will be there or thereabouts if you look at all the losses, all. the national catastrophe losses of the entire year. You can also see that following major. losses normally these loses behave. But there is no guarantee that this will always be the. case.. So what happened in case of these large losses? Look at 2005, the average ROE of the. 10 largest insurance companies, which write at least 50% of their business through. reinsurance, dropped to 2.2%. And that meant, that you saw a reaction on the market,. which was actually as depicted with the Guy Carpenter Rate-On-Line Index for national. catastrophe business. So you can see that following the losses in 2005 and the resulting. unacceptably low ROE of the reinsurance industries, prices increased. But so did the ROE,. which then, of course, in 2006, reached very attractive levels. And as even the 2005. hurricanes were not dislocated -- did not result in a dislocated market. You can see that. the prices after that peaked relatively quickly, I mean, went sliding again. Then you have. 2008. And 2008 is interesting, because 2008 was not a year where you had particularly. high natural catastrophe losses. Nevertheless, the financial crisis resulted in a breakeven. result for the industries. And that, of course, was an unacceptably low ROE for the. industry. And it had an effect on the -- on all of the business, which you can see in 2009.. This effect is a little bit larger than you look at it at the overall reinsurance business not just. the natural catastrophe business. Because in 2009, the increases were rather broadbased. They were basically on all classes because a lot of the market players became. very risk averse. Then, of course, 2009, again, the year ROE was very attractive. And so. we saw the rates starting to slide from 2010 into 2011. And 2011, then we, of course, had. the New Zealand earthquakes and the Japanese earthquake as well as the Thai floods.. That, again, resulted in a rather broad-based increase in rates. And the 2012 level has. actually been -- for the overall reinsurance market have been quite acceptable level. I. mean, if you get that level, we would be very happy. And you could see that the market. remained quite stable in 2013 only to start to slide, again, from 2014 onwards due to the. fact that there was no volatility in the RoEs since 2017.. Of course, for 2017, depending where the losses end up in that bracket between EUR 49. billion and EUR 183 billion, the RoE of the industry will drop on the mid-term probably. again below 5% and that should result in change in the market sentiment and that should. result in rate increases in 2018. And we're already seeing some of that now, particularly on. the facultative side and some of the London market business where you already see a. much firmer markets than we had three months ago.. So this is as the U.S. -- so sorry, it is the worldwide catastrophe business and the facts of. what we have seen in the Third Quarter. Still a lot of uncertainty. But we can expect overall. to be -- to be more favorable trading conditions into 2018, which, of course, should allow. us to deliver improved profitability on our 2018 fiscal and underwriting year on the P&C. side. That brings me to the second issue I want to talk about, which is the U.S. mortality. business. And we have reported, consistently, I would say, at least, over the last 36. months, is that we had worse-than-expected results from our U.S. mortality business, in. particular relating to the business that we have bought from Scottish Re at the end of -- at. the beginning of 2009, the so-called ING block. And of course, the question is why is that. business underperforming and why it looks that the performance that our U.S. mortality. business displays looks comparatively bad compared to our peers? I would first like to. direct you to the left side of the slide. And the basic challenges that we have with the U.S.. mortality business is twofold. One is higher-than-expected mortality at old ages, particular. ages over 85. And secondly, is anti-selective lapse and anti-selective use of policyholder. options, is that the policyholders have in -- in the primary policies and that have an effect. on the emergence of the experience of the reinsurance.. And both phenomena realize themselves at the latest stage of the development of an. underwriting year. Because if you write new business, let's say, if I write new business in. 2017. So I write a block of mortality business based on the reinsurance rates. So-called YRT. rate -- rate-driven facility, of course, in the early years, I mean, it's very unlikely that I will. have higher-than-expected mortality. Because -- I mean the insurers that I cover with my. reinsurance are relatively young. And they have just gone through a medical underwriting. process. So I can assume that the probability that they survive the next 10 years is. extremely high outside accidental death.. Also early on, the insurers have limited options in the policies that can negatively impact. on the experience of the book of business. That changes over time, particular on business. that is, in the end, permanent business. So it's a policy that remains in duration until the. insured passes away. Because if it's a term policy that is being bought, at the end of the. term, the policyholder has a variety of options. One of the options is that he can convert,. in many cases, that policy to a permanent plan. If he does that, there is no new. underwriting. So his classification addressed is still based on the underwriting performed. like 10 or 20 years or 15 years ago. So if he was super preferred at that time, he still gets. a super preferred risk rate 20 years later. That, of course, opens the portfolio for antiselection because if his health has deteriorated, the converting the policy to a permanent. is clearly his best -- is his best option if he wants to continue to be covered.. The other option he has not to lapse the policy, the so-called post-level. I mean, avail. himself the availability to have the post-level term coverage. Post-level term coverage, of. course, there is an assumption of the market that it is anti-selective because the market. assumes that it is anti-selective, you get a higher -- a much higher rate than you have. been paying through the term period. Of course, you have to pay higher rates anyhow. because you are lot older now. But also there's an assumption that if you are very healthy,. you will not continue with your policy there. But you will lapse. And also, here the. assumption of the market was that the post-level premiums may be profitable for the. market because of the higher rate hike and that is not the case. I mean, if the market. assumption for profitability is mainly stemming from the fact that the post-level term. coverage was introduced into the life reinsurance market in order to bolster the. profitability of the overall term-life business.. So here you can see that the problems that you have to foresee the U.S. mortality. business, basically backloaded. And of course, they are larger than the -- and average age. of the policyholders is higher. And of course, if you have block like the ING block, which is. closed for new business for like 13 -- 13 years, the problems crystallize on that block more. than it would, otherwise, be.. If you look at the right side of the graph, this is the new business volume and this is the. new business volume, not by premium but by face value. So it's basically is a sum insured. that has newly written by the reinsurers. And I think these figures are always publicized by. Munich Re, therefore, we can take them. But you can see the dark blue line is the new. business production of Hannover Re. And of course, you can see there is an absolute. spike in 2004, which is one of the more difficult underwriting years due to -- due to poor. underwriting of the primary companies at that time. And so we have really, really a. unproportionately high proportion of our business in those difficult years. And we have a. very low -- unproportionately low business from the years, say 2005 to 2012, which were. pretty good years. And therefore, the problem is the U.S. mortality business crystallized in. our portfolio earlier than in the portfolio of our peers, which have a more evenly spread. issuance of new business. You can see that the cession rate has actually been coming. down over time. Therefore, in the newer years, I mean the years in the new business. written is coming down, anyhow. But that's important to understand if you compare our. numbers to the numbers of our competition.. What does that mean? Or what are the initiatives we have taken? I mean, first of all, prior. to 2016, we saw some impact of the negative developments in the U.S. -- the U.S.. mortality business, largely on post-level terms and some based on -- I mean we saw. some issues with suicides following the financial crisis. They've also alleviated a level of. suicides. And those were addressed by enforced management actions. I mean, firstly, on. the coinsurance business, reducing the collateral cost virtually to 0. I mean that on the. modified coinsurance business means that, that is actually quite stable, most of that is. term life anyhow. And so the problems that we have for that business are basically. remedied by the fact that we reduced the collateral costs dramatically. The only problem. we have is that business remaining is the conversions from term to permanent.. We also had some successful rate increases that we exercised over the years that. mitigated the problem. From 2016 onwards, we saw the increasing trend of additional. mortality and that also initiated our projects -- we call our project reboot, which is the. project that you see in the fourth bullet point, where we have an even closer and more. granular look at the developments of that mortality solutions business. So we have come. up by the end of the Third Quarter with a much clearer view on the future expected. losses of that business.. On an IFRS basis, it's important to understand that the assumptions at the time of the. purchase. So-called purchase GAAP are locked in and as long as the value in force of the. U.S. financial solutions business as a whole being a unit of account are being positive, we. will use the unlock -- we have to use the unlocked assumptions on our IFRS reserving, not. on the Solvency II reserving. Solvency II technical provisions reflect the latest view. But on. IFRS, it's the locked-in assumptions.. That, of course, on the new -- on the newer business normally provides us with good. profitability, (actually) to expected is normally positive. But on the old block, it means that. we would see negative IFRS earnings because the assumptions that are locked in such as. lower mortality and lower benefits payout than our current best estimate and that, of. course, conceptually would mean that we would have on the ING block, as long as it's not. unlocked and there's no reason to unlock it because if value enforce is positive of the. entire block, we will have negative IFRS results on that.. The problems are largely this -- was almost exclusively with YRT business on permanent. plans. And therefore, whilst the situation is not perfect, we have the ability to remedy the. situation that's enforce management actions, which basically resort to increased rates. We. have the right to increase the rates on YRT. That has to do with the fact that this outset. right, which is -- I mean single option that we have that we don't need to seek a consent. of our client, is the reason that the reinsurers on YRT have set right for rate increases, is. because, otherwise, we would have to put up XXX reserves. If we have had -- if you have. to put up XXX reserves, we have to charge our clients for the collateral costs and. therefore, this rate increases are -- the ability to increase rates by the reinsurer is in the. interest of both the ceding company as well as the reinsurer. Of course, we can only. increase rates where it is truly justifying. I mean there really need to be changes in the. exposures, which have not been taken into account when the business was underwritten,. because all things being equal, of course, the client can assume that we will not increase. rates. That means that over time, the IFRS results will improve for 3 reasons: first of all, I. mean the increased rates will, of course, improve the IFRS results; secondly, as we. increase rates, normally, the right -- the client has the right to recapture the business or. even if he hasn't got the right to recapture the business, we would still probably allow him. to recapture the business. That means that we might have an IFRS in that particular year if. we have a negative reserve on that business. But at the same time, of course, for the. future, the expected losses from the recaptured business will not -- will not materialize,. which would of course, means that the IFRS results will improve; and thirdly, the new. business that we write, as you can see on the -- as you have seen on the first slide, is. increasing. And also, the profitability of the new business is increasing. So the IFRS. earnings of the block should actually improve for those 3 reasons in the medium term,. starting this 2019, where you should start to see the fruits of these actions that we're. undertaking.",20171019_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Shareholder_Mtg_Call_2017-10-19_SD000000002905222277.pdf,2017-10-19
12,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Interim Results to 2017. For your information, this conference call is. being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our. conference call, presenting the results for the first half-year of 2017. As always, I'm joined. by our CFO, Roland Vogel.. With group net income of €535 million, our set of numbers for the first half-year 2017 fully. supports our whole year profit guidance of a net income of more than €1 billion. The net. income shows growth compared to last year of 9.6%, which however also has to do with. the fact that last year's second quarter was a bit difficult.. With a foreign exchange rate adjusted growth of 8.7%, the development of our gross. written premiums is quite positive. This growth entirely stems from our P&C business, and. there in particular from significant new business growth of our structured reinsurance. business. This transaction are often surplus relief transactions, with reduced risk transfer. around the expected loss values. Some of the new transactions produced quite sizable. new premium volumes.. Our income from assets under own management increased by 15.3%. This change was. the main contributor for the EBIT growth, which at the half year stands at just under €800. million. The book value per share decreased by 4.8% to €71 due to the dividend payment. including the special dividend in the second quarter, which is in line with our capital. management effort.. In addition, the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar meant that there are. other significant parts of our capital which, for risk management reasons, we hold in U.S.. dollar, saw reduction in value when measured in euro. The return on equity, on the other. hand, grew compared to the first half-year 2016 to 12.2% and remains well above our. minimum target.. Regarding our property/casualty reinsurance business, we saw diverging dynamics. influencing our underwriting income. On the one hand, the decision of the UK government. to reduce the discount rates for compensation payments associated with personal injury. claims, the so-called Ogden rate, from 2.5% to minus 2.75% (sic) [0.75%] resulted in. booked additional loss reserves of €291 million. On the other hand, the major losses of. the first half-year 2017 only came to a number of €123 million, which is well below the. expected levels.. However, both effects only had a marginal impact on the results. If in line with our. common practice, we largely left the unused major loss budget within our IBNR reserves. and, on the other hand, compensated for the additional reserves in relation to the Ogden. tables from the redundancy buffers within our P&C loss reserves.. As a result and aided by a very positive contribution from the investment income, the EBIT. of our property/casualty business grew by 12.7% to €634 million. As this was in line with. the growth of the net earned premium, the EBIT margin remained constant at 14.7%, well. above our minimum target of 10%.. On the life & health side, as expected, we saw a very positive development of the. earnings of our financial solutions business which reached an EBIT margin of close to 30%.. This positive development also compared to last year, however, was more than offset by. continued higher-than-expected claims from our U.S. mortality business. This negative. development relates to a large block of business that we assumed at the beginning of. 2009 and which continues to produce a gross premium volume in the region of $1 billion.. As we have the opportunity on this business to adjust the reinsurance rate where. appropriate, we have initiated a project for a very detailed analysis of the various aspects. that have led to the significantly higher claims than we had expected. This project should. allow us to more precisely tailor our in-force management activity to individual treaties of. the block of business. As a result of this development, and in particular the higher-thanexpected claims of the large assumed block of business, the EBIT reduced to €165 million,. which is clearly below our expectations.. The gross premium development was rather flat with a slight reduction as a result of the. discontinuation of some single-premium treaties and some financing treaties from the UK. and China, which could not be fully offset by a positive new business development.. The return on investment from assets under own management came in at 3.2%, which is. well above the full-year target of around 2.7%. This is mainly the result of very strong. contributions of private equity and real estate portfolios.. On this note, I'd like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain these figures in. more detail.. Roland Vogel. Thank you, Uli, and good morning from my side. The first half-year results of 2017 include. a few material, one-off effects only, so I will try to concentrate my comment on them.. Maybe one short remark before I start. For those interested in analyzing our reserve. situation in more detail, we have published the P&C loss reserve triangles as of. December 2016 on our website today as well.. We will see later that the favorable top line development in the first quarter of 2017 is. entirely driven by our P&C business group whereas our life & health business showed a. small decline in gross premium. Overall, the premium development is slightly ahead of. the range where we initially expected for the full year. Net premium increased by only. 4.9% adjusted for currency exchange effects. With the difference to the gross premium. development driven by additions through unearned premium as the retention was fairly. stable.. We are very satisfied with the investment income. Uli mentioned that already especially. because the increase compared to last year is driven by strong ordinary income and lower. write-downs. Other income expenses increased mainly due to the strong profit. contribution from our life & health financial solutions business as a significant part of these. treaties is booked according to the deposit accounting method and the profits from such. contracts, therefore, show up in the other income lines of the P&L. Just for the sake of. completeness, the tax rate is slightly down but still within the expected range.. Next page, operating cash flows continues to be very positive, very much in line also with. the previous years. Nevertheless, assets under own management decreased to roughly. €40 billion. This is entirely driven by negative currency exchange rate effects of overall. €1.8 billion due to the strengthening of the euro against most of the relevant currencies.. On top of this development, we had the payout of last year's dividend, which overall. could only be partially compensated by the positive operating cash flow of a good €900. million.. On the next slide, to understand the development of the IFRS capital position, one should. start reading that slide on the right-hand side. Shareholders' equity decreased by 4.8%,. driven mainly by factors we have already mentioned. There was a payment of record. dividend of €603 million in Q2. Additionally, the exchange rate movements as a part of. the I had a negative impact of some €480 million.. This especially reflects the currency translation of the capital positions of our subsidiaries,. the U.S. life, the Irish, as well as the Bermuda (11:11) company, balance sheets are. denominated in U.S. dollars, which is the reason that the consolidation of their capital into. the group leads to some volatility in the other comprehensive income on the group's. balance sheet. We, unfortunately, have no influence on the U.S. dollar exchange rate. But. together with our capital management via increased dividend payments, this. development also supports the ROE of more than 12%.. P&C gross premiums increased by a remarkable 16.9% on an FX adjusted basis. This is. mainly based on the successful new business written by our structured reinsurance team,. and it is also fully in line with our reporting on this year's January renewals. Additionally, as. a result of our strong position in the market, we also enjoyed healthy demand in a few. other areas like, for instance, the U.S. or credit and surety leading to further diversified. growth. Also, here, the difference between the gross and the net premium development. was caused by the unearned premium reserve.. At 2.8% of net premium income, major losses were significantly below budget in the first. half-year, mainly owing to the absence of large losses or large loss events in the second. quarter. The combined ratio of 96.5% is admittedly slightly above the full-year maximum. target of 96%. But we should be aware, as in previous years, we stuck to our standard. practice and have kept our large loss expectations in the reserves.. As we have increased our Advanced Solutions book so remarkably and we do write these. contracts with an initial combined ratio of around 99%, still making the margin. The. combined ratio suffers somewhat from that increase in the Advanced Solutions book as. well. As compared to the previous years, that effect accounts for approximately 30 basis. points.. Uli had already mentioned and commented on the Ogden effect. So there is no need to. repeat that here. Overall, based on the fact that we absorbed the negative effect within. our existing IBNRs, the confidence level of our loss reserves should have decreased. compared to the end of 2016, but it's definitely still on a very comfortable level. Apart. from the Ogden rate, the run-off of loss reserves was slightly positive within the expected. range, and did not include any other material effects.. Ordinary investment income was slightly ahead of expectations, mainly driven by the. already mentioned strong contribution from private equity and real estate. Other income. expenses improved by around €30 million. In the P&C segment, this was supported by. positive currency exchange effects. Altogether, the net income for our P&C business. stands at €444 million, up 17% compared to the previous year.. Major losses, significant, below the expected level. We've mentioned that. Most notably,. we did not record any large loss in the second quarter of this year. I think this is premier. for me. By contrast, the second quarter of 2016 was heavily impacted by a number of. large losses. You may remember the Canada loss. The leaves us with a comfortable. cushion number, around €700 million, to absorb large losses for the remainder of the. year, including the unused approximately €220 million of carried forward from the first. half-year.. The large loss list here on the next slide. It should look very familiar to you, as it is almost. unchanged compared to the slide we showed for the first quarter. In total, the loss. estimates for the large losses occurring in the first quarter were adjusted slightly. downwards.. Next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed a healthy underwriting. profitability. The 100% combined ratio for the UK London market and direct business. stands out. And it is the result of the reserve strengthening for the change in the Ogden. table. This also shows and demonstrates that the mitigating IBNR releases came from. across the board rather than the UK motor business only or the motor reserves only.. Overall, the main contributor to the underwriting result in the first half-year was. Continental Europe where we did not record any sizable large losses. Additionally, the. combined ratios for our global cat business, as well as the specialty lines in our facultative. business were favorably below the MtCR and did reach a good profitability.. In life & health, gross written premium decreased slightly by 1.5% adjusted for FX effects,. which is still in the ballpark of our expectations. Also, for the full year, we have seen. growth in a number of regions like China, Australia, and the U.S. This was, however, offset. by reduced premium income due to the discontinuation of large volume treaties,. especially also in our UK annuities segment.. As Uli already mentioned, the result of our U.S. legacy mortality business, again, fell short. of our expectations in the second quarter, which led to an underperformance. expectations of around €50 million in the first half year. On the other hand, the profitability. of our financial solution business continued to be excellent, mitigating a good portion of. this negative effect. Such developments are also reflected in their respective EBIT. margins, as you can see. Finally, our longevity business showed a satisfactory EBIT margin. of 2.3%, which is slightly above the target.. Income from funds withheld declined by €42 million due to the discontinuation of two. large financing treaties. As explained earlier, the significant improvement in the other. income and expenses can almost entirely be explained by the increased result from. treaties recognized according to the deposit accounted method, with a total contribution. of around €93 million in the first half of 2017, an increase of €60 million compared to the. previous year. Currency effects, on the other hand, were slightly negative here.. Other investment income was in line with our expectation. Realized gains were a bit. higher than in the previous years. And just for the sake of completeness, the effect from. our ModCo derivatives was a plus €3.3 million in the first half year.. Looking at the investments, the development in the first six months of 2017 was very. satisfactory, with investment income above our return expectations for the full year. In light. of the strong contribution from private equity and real estate, the ordinary investment. income increased by a remarkable 12.5%. The income from private equity, that, however,. includes some extraordinary elements, which cannot be expected to reoccur in the. second half. Still, the run rate will most likely stay above expectations.. Realized gains were on a similar low level as in the last year, as we continue our policy of. maintaining the bulk of unrealized gains, instead of actively harvesting them.. Depreciations returned to the expected level, mainly consisting of regular depreciation. for real estate. That is because the write-downs on listed and private equity that we had. in the previous year did also not recur.. The overall return on investment was strong at 3.2% which is why we now expect to. achieve more than the previously targeted 2.7% in 2017. For the full year, variation reserves. were stable at a high level compared to the year end of 2016, as the effect from spreads. on the one hand and the interest rate movements on the other hand offset each other. nearly completely.. The next slide shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes contributed to. the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand. side, you can see that we kept our asset allocation more or less stable in the first quarter. to slight increase in higher yielding corporate bonds from 4% to 5% is in line with our. barbell strategy, which we have explained before. And this is how we still invest the new. investments – or invest maturities and free cash flow. And the overall risk appetite stays. unchanged.. The left-hand side illustrates a very strong performance of the private equity portfolio and. the continued positive contribution from the real estate portfolio. As indicated, the 12%. from private equity is expected to trend towards a more normal level over the course of. the year, still being very attractive.. I think that concludes my remarks. And, as usual, I leave the target matrix and the outlook. to you, Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. And, yeah, talking about the target matrix, as you can see, we have. achieved all our group targets in the first half year 2017. The business group target's a. little bit more mixed picture. There's some misses notably on the life & health side.. The treaty renewals in the second quarter which, of course, is the (22:42) renewals in. Florida, through ILS 2017 renewals in the U.S., Australia, some Asia, and some credit and. surety continued to depict a rather competitive market. This is, in particular, true for the. Florida renewal at 2016 where, actually, the rate decreases were a little bit larger than last. year, which was kind of a negative surprise. The other renewals, on the contrary, the 2017s. and the other one, second quarter renewals were more positive and much more in line. with the renewals at 1st of July and 1st of April, which show a slowing trend of the. decreases.. From this background, we achieved good growth of our business by 10%, which was in. particularly aided by our North American business, which actually grew by 15%. The main. driver here was increased share from existing core clients, and here, mostly from the. short-tail lines. We also saw some growth on our U.S. casualty business. However, no new. launched additional transactions here. And we found that the casualty business actually. remained quite competitive.. For treaties that has been loss-free, we saw further rate decreases, mostly in the range of. 3%. However, treaties with losses, which we have seen in particular in the property per risk. business, rate improvements could be achieved between 10% and 20%, in particular, as. far as of course the U.S. business is concerned on the property side.. Australia and New Zealand, the development overall was quite positive, even though. we've continued to see some premium erosion on loss-free business. However, we saw. significant price increases on the Australian business due to the losses from the cyclone. Debbie as well as the New Zealand earthquake at the end of last year. Our market. position in Australia allowed us to increase the volume, to some extent, at a good overall. rate, which meet our margin requirements.. And finally, on credit and surety. We have some new business. We also increased some of. our lines, and that resulted here in a growth of the premiums of around 10%. I should add. that this slide only includes the traditional P&C reinsurance treaty business and does not. include the structured reinsurance business that, again, at 2017, we saw some significant. growth, which was even more pronounced than the traditional business.. If I come to the next slide, which is our guidance. You can see that we have made some. minor changes here based on the outcome of the first half-year and the midterm. renewals. We increased our growth premium target to more than 5%, which is almost. certain at this point in time, because most of the business has already been written, a. very positive development of our investment income in the first half-year. We are now. confident that we will be achieving a return on investment that is in excess of 2.7%. The. group net income and the dividend payout ratio remains entirely unchanged. I would like. to point out once again that we will continue, as our practice, to consider a special. dividend in case that the results come in as expected.. Looking at the overall development of our property & casualty business by sub-segment,. you can see that on the premium side, we see particular growth in the structured. reinsurance business and also the ILS business. Credit and surety, and UK and Ireland are. also growing. UK and Ireland also due to the significant increases that we are getting on. the UK motor business, particular also excess of loss business.. On the other hand, Continental Europe looks more flattish to slightly down. And we also. continue to see some decreases in marine and aviation, where in order to safeguard the. continued positive results, we have to shed some premium. The reduction of income on. the facultative side is mainly the result of some reclassification of facultative business to. the direct business written by our subsidiary into Hannover. And that also contributed to. the increase of the UK, London market, and direct business. Worldwide treaty and. catastrophe excess of loss is rather stable. This continued lower market share on the. catastrophe business than we have overall.. When it comes to the profitability, we continue to expect the margin requirements to be. fulfilled. And we continue results of profitability, in excess of the cost of capital. Particular. positive from the first half-year was Continental Europe. So, we expect to earn above the. cost of capital, and the same is true for the marine business, as well as our facultative. business. With aviation, UK and Ireland due to the Ogden rate table changes and natural. catastrophe business, below the cost of capital, however, this would only come true,. other than UK and Ireland, if we actually hit the expected losses. I suppose aviation and. the catastrophe excess of loss business are, of course, non-proportional business. It. needs exceptional losses in order to achieve the expected loss levels. So, overall, at this. point, it's a soft market, still quite a good picture on our P&C business.. When it comes to our life & health business, we continue to see very profitable business. at stable premium volume of our financial solutions business. Here, I have to say that the. premium volume is less important, because the majority of, particularly the large. transactions, are deposit accounted due to the low or not sufficient risk transfer for. regions accounting, and therefore, the profitability largely shows up in the other income. and expense line.. Longevity business, we expect a slight reduction in the premium, mainly from our. enhanced annuity business, which due to the changing in the environment regarding tax. deductable is actually decreasing. Mortality and morbidity, quite stable to slightly up. And. from a result point of view, we expect that the mortality business will not achieve the cost. of capital and that have to do with the U.S. mortality business. The remainder of the. mortality business has actually quite attractive margins.. This slide should look rather familiar to you as we used it in previous conference calls as. well. On the P&C was is our conservative loss reserve, strong market position, better. terms and conditions on our (32:47). We are quite confident that for the full year, the. combined ratio should stay below 96%, provided that the large losses remained within. budget, so that the overall underwriting result should remain fairly stable.. On the life & health business, we continue to expect negative effects from our U.S.. mortality business. This also includes negative impact, which we already expect for the. third quarter of around $50 million. This relates to an expected recapture of a block of. treaties from our U.S. mortality business, which have had performed very negatively. And. the recapture by the client in this case would result in a one-time negative effect on 2017.. But, of course, in the future years, it will actually improve the results, because the. expected future year losses will, of course, not materialize as the business has then been. recaptured by the client.. I have to say that in line with our in-force management activities, such occurrences could. also happen in future, even though for the remainder of the year, none of those are. actually in sight. As a result of this development, we have reduced our EBIT expectation. for the life & health business from more than €350 million to around €300 million. There. is no reduction beyond or below the €300 million. It's, again, the effect of the significantly. increased profitability that we see from our financial solutions business. Net investment. income, we expect fairly stable also due to the positive development that we already. have seen at the first half year of this year.. On this note, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end our presentation here. And we would. be more than happy to answer your questions.. Q&A. Operator. Our first question comes from Nadine van der Meulen of Morgan Stanley. Please go. ahead. Your line is open.. Nadine van der Meulen. Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my questions. First one is. on the performance in life re, the negative impact from recaptures of around €50 million. expected in the third quarter. Do you expect recaptures to continue to impact the. performance beyond the third quarter?. And on the Europe redundancies, on PYD, if you will. Those have been pretty high in the. last years, ranging from anything between 4% and 10% in the last eight years or so. And. this quarter, the €50 million is, I believe, in line. What can we expect for the full year and in. coming years?. And then, perhaps the last question on Solvency II. So, the ratio at 243%, I suppose the. internal model approval of operational risk is not included, and that should perhaps. (37:08) around 20%. Do you still expect that over the next six months or perhaps part of it. is included? And in that light, you're getting in towards territory of over 260%. I believe. €30 billion of access over that which was about a quarter of your market cap. Could you. comment on what level you are happy with on a lower term view on the capital position?. Thank you very much.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you very much for your questions. On the recaptures on the life & health side,. this has to do with – I mean, in-force management actions, in particular, adjusting rates on. negative performing business efforts.. On some of the treaties, I mean, this received a unilateral right that we have on many of. the treaties. However, of course, we have to take into account the overall relationships. that we have with our clients. And therefore, so far, in all of the cases, we try to come to. neutral solution on this underperforming business. And this often is like sharing of the. burden, which then means that it has a negative effect on our IFRS accounting, but it. would have a positive effect on the technical provisions under Solvency II.. And while there is possibility is that more of that happens, even though as I said, we are. not foreseeing it beyond the €50 million for this year, but certainly, the possibility that we. see more of this next year. So, from that point of view, it has to be expected that the. large block of business of U.S. mortality businesses that we assumed in 2009, potentially,. will continue to be a drag on our result. Of course, increasingly offset by a very positive. financial solutions business, which continues to grow and where we continue to see profit. growth also in the coming years.. And, also, the new business that we write on the mortality solutions, of course, we write. with a wealth of experience that we have from the underperforming block, and therefore,. try to avoid the same pitfalls that we had then. And that of course, is very positive, and we. see pretty good results on those. And as that business grows, I would say, by around 20%. every year, that starts to offset the negative development of that big block. However, I. have to caution that the development on the big block has actually continued to surprise. us negatively with also the first half year in 2017 has been worse than the first half year. 2016. And I have to say that we had expected more in line with the first half year 2016.. When it comes to our loss reserves, the redundancies on the loss reserves, on the P&C. side, of course, we had pretty positive developments there. And with the soft market, we. have expected at least for the last three years that the level of redundancies would. gradually decrease due to the effects of the continued soft market.. Actually, until the end of 2016, that is not happening, as the underlying performance of the. business has been a little bit better than one should have expected, considering the. effects of the soft market. Well, of course, the development of the redundancies in the. current year probably show reduction in the level of redundancies, but remaining at a very. comfortable level. But this has two providers: one is, of course, the large losses hit the. budget; and second, that the Ogden rates stay where they are. So, if those both. providers are so true, we expect to see some reduced redundancies.. Solvency II ratio, still rather new to us. It is, of course, a little bit volatile. Yes, we have got. the approval of our operational risk model for the Hannover Re group, which improved. the solvency ratio. But, of course, you have capital markets developments, which can have. also negative impact on this. Of course, if there's a change in the technical provisions on. the life, which is of course projected for the next 80 years, also that can have a positive,. than lower, I would say, for even this 260%, we would be relatively comfortable.. This also has to do with the fact that we also have to observe the rating agency. development there. And if you, probably, have read S&P – I mean, confirmed our AArating, this is stable outlook. At the same time, S&P has made a number of changes to. their model, of which we're always pointing in the direction of more rather than less. capital needed. Hopefully, this rather long-winded answers gives you some answers to. your questions.. Nadine van der Meulen. Very clear, and very much appreciated. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonny Urwin of UBS. Please go ahead. Your. line is open.. Jonny Urwin. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just two for me. So, firstly on the second. quarter combined ratio. I mean, it's the highest it's been for some time. And you've. obviously flagged some mixed shift going on in there, driven by the growth in structures in. reinsurance. I just wondered if you could provide some more detail. I mean, is it higher. attritional? Is it higher commissions? It looks like it might be higher commissions. And I. guess this a recurring change given the sort of continued growth plans (45:13) reinsurance. there. How should we would be thinking about that combined ratio going forward?. I mean, secondly, just thinking a bit about this growth, so obviously, it's coming through. very strongly, especially on the structured reinsurance side, but also in North America in. the July renewals. I mean, how would you reassure investors about such high levels of. growth in P&C at such a late stage in the pricing cycle? Do you think this changes the risk. profile of the group? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, firstly, on the combined ratio, yes, the structured reinsurance, which has rather safe. margins but not very high margins, had, I mean, 0.3% effect on the combined ratio of the. In addition, of course, I mean, we have the change in the Ogden rate table, which we. used our buffers to absorb. But, of course, we only did that to – I mean, at the least, I. already driving double digit. We thought we keep as much in the redundancy buffer as we. normally want to see.. mean, particular on the specialty lines, I mean we saw improved underlying losses on. credit and surety. Same is true on our marine business and also our European business, as. well as our facultative business. So, we are not concerned to see underlying quality of our. business and the underlying development.. I mean we seem to be increasing – to your second question, increasingly successful in. further improving our positions as a preferred reinsurer with our clients. And that resulted. in quite good growth, underlying growth also outside the structured reinsurance in. pockets (47:52). And this is not by writing significant new large treaties, but it's more by. increasing lines on existing treaties. So, from that point of view, I would argue that it is. actually healthy growth and that the underlying risk profile is not changed actually. It's. probably continuing.. And also, I mean, yes, we are on the fifth year of the soft market. But it's still a little bit. heterogeneous. Yes, on Florida, cat, I mean, we probably already lost 60% of the rating. quality. But that's not an area where we are particularly heavily involved. And other areas. has a more mixed picture. I mean, if you look at Continental Europe, there's some areas. like German motor where we see increases. We also see some other small segments or. larger segments with better development. So, we feel rather comfortable, as I said,. growth even though I appreciate your concerns that you say, well, how can you grow when. the market is actually soft.. Jonny Urwin. That's great. Thank you.. Thank you. Our next question comes from of Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please go. ahead. Your line is open.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much. I just wanted to quickly check on some topic. which have been addressed, but just let me – in the renewals, the change in the share. that we track I think is the highest positive change in a long time. Just a comment, is it just. same thing that we just discussed because you did say that property was something you. have grown in the U.S. So, if you could just comment once again that this is presumably. not Florida but just somewhere else in the U.S. That is one question.. The other question is – for Roland on the – there's a comment on the P&C other income. which is quite confusing to me that the positive FX in 1H caused this. Now, I mean the. dollar literally crashed in 2Q. So, I mean how could this be such a positive number for you?. And just lastly on the Ogden, I think there's a comment somewhere that there's a bit. more – I mean, what should we think – I mean, this was a very large move. If there's more. to come, is it – are you happy assuming Ogden doesn't change? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, firstly, on the change in shares, well, that's in particular the kind of growth that we'd. like to see because, I mean this is business we know. And of course, we screen our. business that we have. And of course, there's always some treaties where we'd like to. have a larger share. And naturally, I mean if we do achieve that, that is less risky than. writing new business. I mean it's not much on the cat side because we haven't increased. our risk appetite on cat. It's more on the per risk business which where we have leading. position in the U.S., and some of those is a long-tail line. (51:37) I mean it starts to aid us a. little bit that we are not aggressively competing with our insurance clients, and that helps. us at times to increase our shares.. Vinit Malhotra. Can I just follow up the share you're winning is from very, very small players, do you think,. or from other mix life there? Could you comment a bit – or larger players?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I guess, on the long-tail business, of course, if you've gained shares, it would be. from the larger players because, I mean, they are mostly involved in the long-tail business.. In general, I would say it's probably more from the larger than the smaller players in this. case.. I mean on Ogden, what we have done on Ogden – I mean we haven't, I mean, taken the. Ogden losses and run it against our UK model, IBNR reserves, which we could have done. but we've chosen to reserve them in addition. So, I mean outside – in addition to what we. have put up on Ogden in the second quarter, which is the €290 million of which around. €230 million is UK motor excess of loss.. We're still holding €250 million IBNRs on our UK motor business which, of course, we. could have used to bolster the Ogden. But we just wanted to highlight the effect of the. Ogden table rates. I mean, there might be further development in the Ogden losses,. primarily because – I mean if we have new claims now, of course, they will also be. reserved in accordance to the Ogden rate, which would mean that that reserve would be. higher.. And, of course, some of the claims that have already occurred are still in the phase of the. assessment of the injuries and the assessment of the quantum of loss, therefore, and of. course, both of them higher expected losses are being used. And that will, of course,. then be offset against the actual UK motor IBNR reserves. So, I would say, with the. addition of the Ogden rate reserves, our – I mean sufficiency of our UK motor reserving. has actually slightly improved.. And I think the other question is for you, Roland.. Roland Vogel. I think that was – the question's around the effect of the currency exchange rates. So,. Vinit, you mentioned that the U.S. dollar had weakened and this should have a negative. rather than a positive effect. I would not agree to that. Well, you know that we usually try. to be as matched as possible currency-wise. I have to compromise my matching exercises. as I have so many balance sheets to match. It's a German GAAP balance sheet. It's the. IFRS balance sheet. It's also an economic balance sheet. They deviate from each other, so. I have to compromise here or there. So, I can never be 100% matched on an IFRS basis.. determine how much U.S. dollar assets I have by the end of the quarter, so exactly the. 30th of June. Still, the reserving exercise happens a little bit later so actuaries (56:00), so. difference driven from the currency exchange rate for P&C was, I think, some €19 million. (56:12), an effect which we have. So, this compares to the matching exercise of more than. €20 billion in reserves.. So, you can foresee that it can be a little bit volatile. So, in that respect, any movement in. volatility is a demonstration that the CFO didn't do a good job in matching his balance. sheets. So, it's not this direction is always positive or this direction is always negative.. Again, I can be short; I can be long in my matching exercise. So, it's a little bit coincidence.. Moreover, there is one other aspect which is included here. We did write off all our. receivables in Venezuela last year, some of which could then still come in, so there is. another positive effect, which is where we benefited, where we had a little bit of loss last. year and a little bit of profit this year. So, it is unfortunate that we cannot avoid the. volatility of that line entirely.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead. Your. line is open.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Morning, everyone. Just coming back to life reinsurance, and apologies for that. Just. thinking about 2018 and the outlook for that business and the EBIT. So, I guess we started. this year with €350 million. We're now down to €300 million. I guess when you take the. charge in the third quarter next year, you'd expect 2018 to improve as a result. I just want. to understand whether that's starting from the €300 million base or the €350 million base. as a kind of starting point.. And then, I guess, on top of that, do we need to think about a greater contribution from. financial solutions next year? So, that – kind of where do we start, is it €300 million or. €350 million, and then do we need to factor in greater financial solutions contribution?. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean there's no apology for this question because it's very high on our minds. I. mean, if you look at the results here, I mean good is becoming better and the bad is. becoming worse, is probably fair to say. I mean, as I've already pointed out, I mean the. development in the first half-year of the actual versus expected was a negative surprise. to us.. And I mean, this re-occurring surprise, we would be optimistic still to assume that the. second half-year on the actual to expected would revert to our expectation level for the. entire year. So, we are not expecting that. Gradually, we believe that we should see an. improvement here from the fact that we are actually increasing rates or seeing recaptures. initiated by our clients, which means that future losses are actually reducing.. On the financial solutions side, we continue to have a pretty full pipeline of new business.. Therefore – I mean there is a quite big increase of the results this year. As these treaties. are not single year treaties but multi-year treaties, I mean certainly we start the next year. at the same level than we end this year. And then the new treaties, which we're expecting. in addition would come on top of that. So, I mean, also for next year, you will – we can. pretty certainly expect the increased profitability on our, particularly U.S. financial solutions. business. But I mean we have become extremely cautious on our – a large block that we. assumed on the UK (sic) [U.S.] mortality business.. cautioned and say maybe the EBIT should stay at around the €300 million mark, and we. should not budget for an increase.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. It's very clear. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Guilhem Horvath of Exane BNP Paribas.. Please go ahead. Your line is open.. Guilhem Horvath. Yes. Thank you. I'll come back a little bit on life insurance. Once again, I appreciate that. you're remaining cautious and that it's probably too soon to tell. But just going back on. the project you mentioned earlier, I'd like to know when do you think you'll be able to. have a better view on how much recaptures on EBIT or how much rate increases?. Because you mentioned 2018 to Nadine's question, do you think this is the kind of. timeframe needed in order to re-price the business and to get rid of the bad bits of the. business or do you think it's a much longer process? That's my first question.. And the second is on return on investments, private equity, real estate and parts of it,. which is not sustainable. Can you discuss a little bit what you think is sustainable, and also,. when you think the ordinary income on fixed income assets will stabilize because you. mentioned once again the decrease this half year. And I'd like to know if you see some. stabilization at some points on the fixed income part? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, we expect that on the U.S. mortality that, at the latest, by the end of the year, we. should have the result from the project as regards the expected future losses and the. change in those expectations. And well, of course, the in-force management actions will. start or have already started, but we'll accelerate them. And we expect quite a lot of that. happening this year and the remainder next year. Conclusion of the whole exercise will. probably take, I mean the best part of two years, I would say.. Roland Vogel. Yes. And to the investments, the private equity, so the extraordinary portion within the. first half-year was a little bit short of €30 million according to our internal calculation. If we. expect a little bit but less in the quarters to come and annualize that, you could argue. that, for instance,10 basis points did come from that. And so, this would be the. extraordinary portion, which is included here.. So, longer term, we see that it's still positive and it is remarkably above the 2.7%. We do. calculate the 2.7% nearly without realized gains and losses. We had realized gains and. losses or realized gains on the same level than last year. So, if we take these things out. and look at the 2.7%, I think we mentioned that also for 2018, our fixed income book has. an expectation of around 2.7%.. That is also true for 2019. We are in the middle of the planning phase. I will be a little bit. more concrete at the occasion of the Investors' Day. But I think for the years to come, we. see a stabilization on the 2.7% level. Now, we have to see what the outperformance. components of this year will do in the years to come. But it is slightly more positive than. we had anticipated before.. Guilhem Horvath. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivan Bokhmat of Barclays. Please go ahead.. Your line is open.. Ivan Bokhmat. Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on reserve redundancy. I just. wanted to try to make sure I understand the message. So, the Ogden reserve of €291. million, I understand it wasn't fully offset with the reserve releases, which, as normal,. you've been mentioning in the past around that €50 million per quarter.. Does it mean that in reality, the reserve redundancy that you've put through in the first. half of the year was a little bit over €150 million? Is that the right way to think about it? Or. maybe you can give a better indication. And secondly, whether you have any further. releases planned related maybe to Ogden rate in second half of the year?. And then, the second question, more broad. You've mentioned that in the loss affected. buckets of the market and renewals, you did see then 20% rate increases. At this stage of. the soft market, how does it compare with what you've seen in the past? Let's say in Fort. McMurray losses, how did the market perform or in the earlier occasions? Are we seeing a. more muted increase in rates after loss occurrence? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, to Ogden, I mean the reduction in the redundancy, I think your figure of €150 million. is probably in the ballpark, I would say not being an actuarian. Of course, the actual. (01:07:00) calculations have to be done. I would say between €110 million, €200 million,. something like that.. And while – I mean, the increases following the Fort McMurray fire, so a little bit higher. than we have seen on the loss-affected treaties now, that hasn't necessarily to do with. the soft market but the Fort McMurray fires were basically the largest cat loss in Canada. and affected an entire market. When we talk about loss-affected increases in the, say, on. the (01:07:43) renewal, these are individual treaties that have losses, and are not – I mean. losses that affect the entire markets.. So, it's just the individual (01:07:57) like you have a property per risk treaty and on. business that is written 100% by the clients that was a big fire loss. So, this program then. have the loss. While the other programs of the other clients remain loss-free and, of. course, there's a little bit, of course, of an offsetting of the goodwill to bad; and. therefore, I mean, in this situation then that's largely what we have observed insofar this. year, of course, (01:08:32) increases will be lower and have been lower in all market. cycles. But we still are relatively pleased that the market, with very few exception, has. retained its ability to respond to losses with rate increases.. Ivan Bokhmat. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from William Hawkins of KBW. Please go ahead. Your. line is open.. William Hawkins. Hi, guys. I'm sorry, I'm coming back to the life business because I've been learning stuff as. you've been answering questions. Could you just clarify some points for me? On slide 9,. you've talked about this €50 million below expectation for the technical results. Is that. figure only the impact of the recapture that you talked about or is that also reflecting the. comment you made about underlying in the first half being poorer than the first half last. year? If it's not included in that, could you try and scale the amount by which the. underlying has also been poorer?. And then also, I was going to ask whether you're finally going to do a sort of a fuller. review of all of this business and you seem to imply in an answer to a question that you. are because you've just mentioned the process is going to take a couple of years. Again,. as much as you can scale the risk from this, are we talking sort of the €50 million kind of. range that you referred to when you were talking about 2018 EBIT or is there a risk that. you're doing a fuller review that could be something more material for the Hannover Re. Group? I mean I appreciate this is quite scaled down within Hannover Re Group in general,. but I'm just wondering, is this a double-digit issue or could we, at some point, have to. face something slightly bigger? I'll leave it at that. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Thank you, Will. Firstly, on the €50 million, the €50 million in the first half-year is. entirely this (01:10:23) recapture. There was just actual to expected, worse than planned.. William Hawkins. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. So, the €50 million recapture that's – and one is euro, the other is U.S. dollar, which I would. have said is almost the same but no longer maybe, the €50 million is pretty safely to be. expected development which is subject to conclusion of some agreements here.. Yes, we take a fuller (01:11:02) review. I would say yet again on this business and the. numbers involved are relatively large, but they go both ways. I mean if you look at it from. an economic perspective, we already strengthened the technical provisions last year on. our Solvency II balance sheet by more than €500 million from this big block of assumed. business. Of course, there was other business, which was a lot more positive. So, we're. talking relatively large numbers here, but in both directions.. I mean, of course, one is the rate increases that we are pitching for, of course, depend on. the losses we are expecting because, I mean on business which goes well, we would of. course not even thinking about rate increases. And business that goes marginally. negative, also we would probably not do any rate increases. It's only business that. performs very badly and of course one aim of the project is that we identify the exact. level of rate adjustment that is necessary on individual treaties on this one.. And, of course, that's what I mean (01:12:40) that this treaty's what – then of course, after. the action being done and agreed with a client, we would then, of course, have no further. negative effect from these treaties. But, yeah, I mean, the important cost that we have is. that we are able to stir the development of the future premiums in line with the. development of the future losses, which on the block I was talking about is clearly up.. William Hawkins. Got you. If I may just ask one other clarification please. The €93 million deposit accounted. other income, you made this comment that that's sort of a sustainable number. And I just. wanted to double-check that because sometimes the deposit accounted business, you. can sort of get an IFRS new business profits that then kind of fade next year. But you're. clearly saying that you've got €93 million in the first half of this year, and therefore, there. would also be €93 million in the first half of next year?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. From the deposit accounted, that's absolutely true. I mean these treaties are or. these transactions are really – I mean, multiyear transactions. And I mean they run – they're. risk remote. Otherwise, they wouldn't be a deposit accounted. And I mean they run. exactly according to plan.. William Hawkins. Okay. Lovely. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Please go. ahead. Your line is open.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. Two very quick clarifications. On Ogden, I guess none of the Ogden reserves or. very little of the Ogden reserves that you've taken, I guess, relate to claims that have. actually paid out. So, should there be (01:14:37) in Ogden rate backed up? What. happened with the reserves you've taken? Will they just be incorporated into your reserve. buffer? And linked to Ogden, what kind of level of rate increases have you been seeing. across your UK matrix (01:14:57) book?. And the same question, it's just a bigger picture one, Uli, you're encouraging us to take. down our numbers for life EBIT assumingly forever. And I guess, for 2017, you've offset. that at a group level. The guidance of group net income hasn't changed because of. higher investment income and, I think, from effect (01:15:22) from higher non-life premium.. Just thinking through to 2018, are there any offsets? Do you still anticipate further followthrough from the additional non-life volume you put on this year or there will be margin. offsets negating that? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, l mean firstly, on Ogden, I mean if the rate would be swing back up, of course, the. majority of the additional loss reserves would not be necessary. And the reason is that. they basically come from UK motor excess of losses, which mostly attach an excess of €10. million. And, of course, I mean these existing claims have grown into the layers which. previously were below the layers.. And, of course, I mean if the Ogden rates go up again, it would be taken from the top. and, therefore, the entire fact would actually come out of our reserves which, however,. for the time being, we have to I mean expect the Ogden rate as they are. And that's also. reflected in the price development. Then, I mean, we have seen region's rates doubling. which, of course, it has a compound effect with primary rates increasing as well to the. absolute premium volume has been more than doubling.. This is not an outrageous increase (01:17:05) because at the level where we're playing,. also the expected losses have doubled. So, I mean, just purely, I mean, adjusting the rate. for the effects of the Ogden rate and that has been available in the market. So, it's. nothing particularly exciting because, I mean, we just adjust the rate to what is necessary. in line of the Ogden rate.. I mean, on the EBIT of the life, still I would say for the medium term, we expect an. increase there. Actually, quite a hefty increase to the extent that we can get the problem. on our U.S. mortality business soft, I mean we would have a significant higher run rate of. EBIT. In the meantime, we think that certainly for 2017, and the first half-year depicts that. actually quite well, I think the P&C side and the investment income should be, I mean,. filling the hole that the life & health leave within – compared to our planned figures. So,. from that point of view, I mean the other aspects of the business should be sufficiently. profitable to safeguard the guidance.. And for 2018, of course, not yet time to do a guidance for 2018. I think the growth in the. P&C side, we would also expect some growth in the profitability of our P&C business.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Haid of Commerzbank. Please go. ahead. Your line is open.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just clarification. Sorry that I have to come back to. life re. The problems of the U.S. mortality group, just to understand, is this only the book. that you acquired in 2009, i.e., the former ING Scottish Re portfolio? And have you done. the math regarding the accumulated loss that this book incurred? And how come that you. so materially misjudged the healthiness of that book over the past – or when you actually. acquired this book? That's my only question.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, it's only that books because all the other U.S. mortality business is going according to. plan. You may recall that we have also assumed two smaller blocks from Scottish Re, both. of them performed better than expected, and so that's what we call the organic business. which is the new business that we are writing.. I mean how come that we have misjudged it and we clearly have. I mean there's no. discussion about that possible. I mean the reason is that this was block of a very large. number of individual treaties, which had I mean an even exponentially large number of. underwriting years. And the assumptions that were used at the time, they're not detailed. enough to capture the individual risk parameters of all the different treaties and different. portfolios that we were assuming. So, in other words, there were some general. assumptions on mortality, on lapse and other policyholder options that policyholders have. in the U.S. that have an effect on the expected claims.. There was also probably, it's too broad assumption on the expected mortality. improvement, in particular, for the older ages that is not resembling in the actual. experience that we see on some of the treaties. That, I guess, was the reason. It's not a. good reason because it's never a good reason if something goes wrong, but (01:22:06).. Michael Haid. And you acquired this book back in 2008 or 2009. It's almost 10 years ago. How much of. this book has matured already? How much – yeah.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if you look at the net amount at risk, which is basically the sum insureds, it's about. 45% of the sum insureds or the net amount at risk that had come off the risk, that have. come – they just expired.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andreas Schäfer of Bankhaus Lampe. Please. go ahead. Your line is open.. Andreas Schäf er. Yeah. Thanks. So, just one question regarding your reinvestment yield for the first half of. this year. So, is it still around about 2%, as far as I can remember? And on second question. is clearly why do you expect, let's say, for a longer period of time – I understand two or. three years – a more or less unchanged investment yield in your portfolio?. Roland Vogel. Yeah. It is – again, as I mentioned, we do do the planning exercise right now. On the one. hand, we have reinvestment yields, for instance, in the U.S. dollar, where we invest monies. today higher than they mature. Again – so this – and it also depends a little bit on the. maturity profile. So, it's not the run rate for – which I can comment on, on the next 10, 15. years. But as we had been looking at the maturity yield or the yields of the maturing book. and the current reinvestment yields and that in combination, with the anticipated and. planned changes of the portfolio to move the reinvestments not to exactly where we are. today.. But to other areas, so for instance, we do not reinvest a lot or even nothing into covered",20170810_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2017-8-10_FS000000002366682695.pdf,2017-08-10
13,"Good afternoon to everybody here in Frankfurt and good afternoon to all of those joining. us via the Internet. Welcome to Hannover Re's Analysts' Conference 2018. Looking at the. dialed-in list, it's truly a pleasure to see that so many of you have taken up our invitation. and are showing your interest in Hannover Re. As you know, we have the key figures. already published four weeks ago together with the 01/01 renewal results. And today, we. are delighted to present to you the full set of numbers in greater detail.. Before we get started on them, may I say how impressed I am by your work over the past. year. It was particularly striking to see how much effort and time many of you invested in. anticipating, not only the large loss numbers from the hurricanes, but also the effect from. our retro program. In many cases, your calculations came incredibly close to the actual. mark.. Once again, you were instrumental in advising the understanding both of the reinsurance. business in general and our positioning in particular. And you delivered a value. contribution for the investors. Even though we are now living in the world of MiFID II, I. hope that the high regard in which investors hold you has in no way been diminished. For. our part, I would certainly like to thank you for your dedication and your work, and to do. please keep it up.. Today, we are also offering a dialed-in option for all those who were not able to. participate physically here in Frankfurt. As a reminder, the dialed-in participants will be in. listen-only mode during the presentations. Please note, this conference will be recorded,. and the replay will be available on our website.. I would also like to draw your attention to the feedback questionnaire, which we have. distributed in advance and which you will find on your desk. As you know, we greatly. appreciate your remarks and as you know, this is the groundwork part for preparing the. Investors Day, which will be held in (00:02:59). Feel free to either leave the feedback. form at your table or send it in to Julia, Axel (00:03:07).. First of all, Ulrich Wallin, our CEO, will kick things off with a brief overview of 2017 financials. and that will be followed by our CFO, Roland Vogel. Then, again, the outlook will be. presented by Ulrich again.. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond at length to all your questions. And I would like to. point out that we do please ask you to wait for the microphone so that everybody can. understand your questions, even those who are not in the room.. On that note, I'm delighted to hand over to Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. (00:03:53) and welcome. Yeah. Thank you for coming to our investor's presentation for. the 2017 result. You can see that we have chosen a smaller room compared to last year.. And that, of course, tells you that even if as well as net income is down compared to last. year, I'm happy to tell you that the expense ratio is down as well, so the two might go. hand in hand. But on that note, I would rather want the expense ratio be higher rather. than lower. But that's not an option. I mean, why is the result down? Of course, because of. the exceptional hurricanes which dominated the 2017 results. Particular, of course, wellpublicized, the so called HIM losses, Harvey, Irma and Maria. And then we also had some. wildfires in California which were quite expensive, earthquakes in Mexico and also in. Australia. We had Cyclone Debbie, which also did not come entirely for free.. Therefore, insurance – reinsurance industry was heavily impacted by those losses, and. that's not a surprise because that's one of the major reasons our insurance company buy. reinsurance is because in years where you have exceptionally high net catastrophe losses. to other losses, then you have your reinsurer to help you out that you have a more. consistent results and less volatile earnings as an insurance company. Of course, the. flipside is what the reinsurer have, it takes the volatility from the ceding company, and. therefore we have some volatility.. Nevertheless, we feel that at Hannover Re we faired pretty well. I mean, we still were able. to record a 10.9% RoE, just still above our hurdle, just 900 basis point above risk-free, and. it compares favorably with the average RoE of the 10 launches to reinsurers, which stands. at the 3.3%. So, whilst in absolute terms our results are less good than last year; in relative. terms, compared to our peers, I think they are probably the best we ever had. The only. thing is that they (00:06:44) rather have absolute profits rather than relative profits.. But it still shows you that we have that relatively well in 2017. One of the reasons, of. course, was that we sold our listed equities, which boosted our investment results to an. all-time high, but that was, of course, also helped by double-digit increase in the ordinary. investment income. So, our investment manager, Roland, for (00:07:22) the start of 2017.. The P&C business is all right, considering the circumstances as the large loss budget was. succeeded by €302 million. However, we had a pretty good development of our loss. reserves from older years where we saw fairly significant positive results without actually. compromising on the quality of our loss reserves, which are still at a high level. I mean, we. have limited threshold system on the level of our loss reserves because we should, of. course, in theory, be at about 100% confidence level being best estimate. So, we have a. threshold which is at 106%. If the confidence level is higher than 106% – be in the. (00:08:33) area, and I can assure you that we continue in the (00:08:37) area, at least. according to our own actuaries and according to a pre-study of our external actuary firms. that looks at our reserves every year. So, the quality of the P&C result is not diminished by. taking out of the confidence level of the loss reserves.. On the life and health side, the performance has been good except the U.S. mortality. business and here in particular and only, I would almost say, is a large block of business of. the ING Business that we bought in the first quarter of 2009 from Scottish Re. On this. business, we initiated vigorous in-force management action, which already in 2017 has. resulted in the recapture, which took off a fair amount of the future liabilities and future. expected losses.. But in the 2017 (00:09:51) €45 million of losses. I can already say at this point in time that. we expect more of that recaptures in 2018 because our in-force management actions are. accelerated quite significantly in 2018.. What does that mean for the dividend? It remains unchanged at €5, including the €1.5. extraordinary or special dividend. The book value per share has come down slightly. This is. due to the fact that significant amounts of our capital are being held in U.S. dollars. But in. fact, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. That U.S. dollar capital in euro. terms is, of course, less.. There is not too much of a problem for us because also we have – I would say, more than. 50% of our exposure that creates a need for capital are also denominated in U.S. dollars.. So, at the same time, in euro terms, the capital decreases, also does the capital. requirement. And that is reflected in the solvency ratio, which has actually increased. significantly from 230% at the end of last year, of 2016, to only 260% at the end of last. year. It is also both aided by the fact that we got the approval of our regulator for the. Hannover Re Group to use our operational risk model in the official solvency calculation.. And that also had boosted the solvency ratio. So, all in all, the financial strength of. Hannover Re has actually improved last year. So, I said the results have been great, but in. relative terms quite acceptable.. And on this rather general note, I will hand over to Roland who will give you all the finer. details.. Roland Vogel. Well, thank you, Uli. Haven't been announced as the star, I don't know whether that's really. true. It is a pleasure for me to also present a good set of number, although obviously the. market reaction today was not that convincing. And I hope we will be able to address at. least some of the concerns. And this is also why I think it does make sense to really. concentrate and focus my comments on such details, which I find – I was mentioning, and. then give you all the opportunities to ask the questions to the largest extent.. Let's start with the operating cash flow, an important number. You see it, nearly €1.7 billion. which is, from our point of view, a good cash flow number still. It is lower than it was in the. previous years. What is the reason for the decrease? We've seen payouts for the. hurricane losses in Q4 already. That amounts to approximately €400 million. So, here, we. also see the impact of the hurricanes. Apart from that, one should also bear in mind that. with the impressive P&C growth, which we will be discussing in a minute, one should. assume or potentially has expected a higher positive cash flow number. But as this growth. is driven by the Advanced Solutions business which is not really cash-rich, these are usually. quota shares. They are accounted on the quarterly, half, yearly – or even yearly basis, and. you would only get a balance from these quarter shares.. It is not a non-proportional business where you get a premium in the beginning and then. later on the outflow of the claims. So, in that regard, again, this is not a very cash flow rich. business and this is also why the cash flow hasn't been boosted by it as perhaps one. would have expected. Still, we mentioned €1.7 billion in positive cash flow in such a year,. still very positive.. Why does the asset base on the right-hand side does not increase if there is a positive. operating cash flow? Uli has mentioned that, and we will come to that point, more than. one story, in the presentation that is a reflection of the currency exchange rate. movement. We see a decrease of €1.7 billion of the asset base, €2.5 billion is the impact. of the U.S. dollar, €2.9 billion negative is the impact of the currency exchange rates overall. as also other currencies have depreciated vis-à-vis the strong euro over the course of. 2017. By the way, according to our – the currency exchange rates we've been using, the. dollar had lost 14%.. That is also to be seen on the next page when it comes to shareholders' equity, which is. the policyholders' surplus which is really reflecting the shareholders' equities here as. nothing has really changed on the hybrid or the minority share side. We also see that the. shareholders' equity is going down by €500 million from €9 billion to €8.5 billion.. Let's look on the right-hand side. Here, we see the explanations. We have a very positive. net income. So, that goes up by the €959 million. Then we have paid out a dividend and. we have a change in unrealized gains and losses. So, here the impact of, for instance, the. sale of our equity portfolio after minorities after tax, and that reflection here is not that. much. But, of course, also here, we have seen some decreases in the OCI, reflecting the. market values of our asset.. But also here, you see the currency translation, €740 million. That is exactly – I think Uli. mentioned that already, a reflection of all the capital positions which we have invested in. the U.S. dollar and which came down. Of course, also our liability side and our exposures. came down at the same point, and we will see later on that our solvency ratio has. increased from 2,000 – from 230% to 260%. So, the last absorption capacity of the. Group or the exposure and absorption capacity of the Group has increased and not. decreased. I think that is important to understand. And in that regard, the €9.5 billion has. indeed also aided a little bit the RoE position because, of course, that is positive here.. And the RoE is here reflected on the next page. 10.9% vis-à-vis a hurdle of 9.8%, which. means an outperformance of 110 basis points in a year with a remarkable exceedance of. our large loss budget, which I feel is remarkable. We also see on the right-hand side, on a. 5-year or a 10-year or a 15-year average, the RoEs which we have produced are around. 14%. Yes, the 2017 year is a little bit lower than that, but with a double-digit RoE, I think we. are still in a good position. And that good position also allows us to keep the dividend. payments up. Here, we see the dividend or distribution history since 2008. Ever since. 2014, we have paid out remarkable bonuses on top of the regular dividend, which reflects. our dividend policy of 35% to 40% of Group net income. That also means in a year where. we have this after-tax profit position a little bit depressed that our payout ratio has. increased from 51% to 63% in the year 2017. And we will hear that we are expecting this to. continue going forward, if nothing extraordinary is going to happen. If we take today's. price – not yesterday's price, but today's price of €110 per share, that translates into a. dividend yield of 4.5%, which I also think should support what we have been saying. We. are in a poor position again when it comes to the RoE. Table here was 10.9%.. We are, and Uli mentioned that on average, the rest or the 10 largest reinsurers here. have produced 3.3%. That is below 5%. And it was always our prediction that an RoE. below 5% for the industry should trigger a reaction. We have seen a little bit of a reaction,. not as much as we have anticipated. On the other hand, if you look at the average RoEs. on the right-hand side, which have not become so much under pressure already, this. perhaps is a little bit of explanation why the reaction has not been as pronounced as we. had expected.. Still, if – then you might have the question what happened to peer number three, I think. this is a U.S. company and it has benefited from Mr. Trump remarkably so they could. decrease their deferred tax liabilities remarkably because they are to be calculated with. another tax rate. This is the explanation for the outperformance here. But the rest of the. market has performed lower than Hannover Re.. So, now, let's have a look at the Group's result really briefly. We will come to all the. different segments. So, there is not a lot worth mentioning on that level. FX-adjusted. double-digit growth, I think that is really remarkable here on a Group level. The net. retention was stable, and it should be stable also going forward. The tax ratio is down. from 24.2% to 19.2%. The background of that is the sale of the equities, which is nearly. tax-free. And these tax-free or nearly tax-free profits have benefited the tax ratio. This is. obviously not sustainable going forward.. So, in our plan, we assume that the tax rate is going to be 25% around (00:23:00) on a. long-term sustainable basis. The details will follow on the next pages. You see that on the. P&C side, impressive growth, 19% FX-adjusted driven. We've mentioned that before by. the Advanced Solutions structured reinsurance business. Apart from that or if we adjust. for that, the growth would still have been more than 4% or is more than 4% from the rest. of the business. The net premium income goes up as well.. Where, the growth areas? North America, Europe, credit and surety, and the London. indirect market. These were the main contributors to the growth which we have seen. Of. course, results driven by the €300 million exceedance of the large loss budget, translates. into 3 percentage points above the budget. And that was mitigated to some extent or to. quite some extent by a positive runoff. You might have seen the numbers, more than a. billion euro in positive runoff. Some explanations here.. I think we have asked our actuaries to come up with a new kind of long-term sustainable. number. Some of you might remember that we once mentioned €200 million a year, €50. million per quarter. That is a number with the large increases which we have seen here. over the last years in the redundancy numbers. Also, of course, the regular runoff. numbers have increased. The latest numbers which we heard and we will confirm and. might have a little bit more details in October with that regard is around €400 million.. That is what we expect these days as a regular runoff number.. Moreover, we had a very attractive positive runoff in our aviation results. Here, a very large. loss event in the past have been settled and that came with a very positive triple-digit. million euro amount in the fourth quarter, which was nice. We also had commuted other. parts of our U.S. business that was especially still asbestos related, which also had. increased the positive runoff.. I did mention last October some systematic things in (00:26:03) one or the other area of. the world, we still only have underwriting year numbers which also usually translate in. some positive runoff. But I think the important thing is, and Uli had mentioned that before,. this positive runoff has not impaired our loss or confidence level.. You might remember, these numbers still include the Ogden rates, €300 million, that was. in the second quarter. We mentioned that we had mitigated the impact of the Ogden rate. of €300 million by loss reserve releases. That should translate then in the assumption that. the loss reserve redundancies should have gone down by €300 million, which is not the. case. The Ogden rates are still booked at the €300 million level. But the indications are. that at least after also taking into account that, for instance, it was interesting to see this. very positive runoff in the aviation space, for instance, had led to the assumptions that no. other redundancies would be in the aviation reserves, which is not the case. So, during the. reserve assessments over the course of the year, we expect redundancies to be. recognized again, and the assumption would be that by October the reserve should be. on a level as they had been last year, especially as we have to assume that the Ogden. rate will be adjusted, maybe not this year, but then upwards next year; and some of the. redundancies which we had released will come back.. So, just to keep the message straight is really the level of reserve redundancies might. have also gone down slightly based on the currency exchange rates, which also have an. impact here because some of the redundancies are U.S. dollar redundancies and they are. also impacted by the currency exchange rates. But if we look at it from a percentage-wise. redundancy level, we should be approximately on last year's level.. I think that the rest had been mentioned by Uli already. A very acceptable result for a year. where we had such large losses.. Here at the – I think on the next page, you see the large losses gross and net. The. interesting thing here is, yes, with €1.79 billion, this gross loss is really the largest we ever. had. Still, it gives a little bit or it needs a little bit of an explanation because this now. includes ILS losses which we take on and cede on. So, if we adjust for that, I think the. gross loss in equal terms to, for instance 2011, which we can see here, has been lower,. and the retrocession impact has been lower if we exclude the ILS impact in these. numbers.. The single events here on the next page, not that much which is to be said here. We've all. seen the numbers, we've all seen the developments. I think it is worth mentioning that the. Californian wildfires, the two of the fourth quarter amount to €100 million overall. So we. had a budget of €200 million for the fourth quarter, so that was below. But still, with the. €100 million, also the wildfires had been a large loss in the year 2017. And without them,. the impact of the hurricanes would have been lower.. So a brief look at the MtCR and the business lines, how they performed on the P&C side, I. think this is also not really a surprise what we can see here, the hurricanes and the fires hit. North America. This is why here, the combined ratios is remarkably over the hurdle. We. also see aviation a negative combined ratio, I think not too many instance where I saw a. negative combined ratio. This is explained by the positive run-off results, which we have. already mentioned. UK and London market, that is impacted by the Ogden rate. You. might ask, well, if you had decreased your IBNRs, why is it that this exceeds the MtCR so. much. I think the release of the large loss of the redundant reserves came from other. segments as well, not only from UK and the London market. This is why Ogden can be. seen here so pronounced.. And of course, so the cat lines are impacted by the hurricanes. The structured reinsurance. as you see, large, higher combined ratios as expected but still very profitable, so the. 97.7% reflects our profit expectations fully. These are risk-limited exposures, where the. margin, which we make here, make it really sufficient.. I think that is – now, the one area Uli had mentioned that before, which had not really lived. up to our expectation. So the U.S. mortality still underperforms for the legacy block, the. ING portfolio. The background profitability of that segment, if we concentrate always on. the U.S. mortality, is a little bit ignored. To some extent, here the financial solution (sic). [solutions] business really was exceptionally good. That explains the other income and. expense line. Here, the profitability goes up by €100 million. This is really where we reflect. the profitability of these deposited accounted contracts. So here you see that we've really. had a remarkable increase in profitability from financial solutions business.. Also, the longevity business with a 2% doesn't sound so impressive. You know that we. have started that business, we have increased it remarkably over the last years. So we are. in early stage. The profitability is reflected in line with the emergence. So the 2.1% which. we see here and which is above the target really fulfills our profitability requirements. And. also the mortality business around the world, apart from the ING Business is really. performing according to our expectations.. Still, with a €245 million EBIT, we are below expectations. And this is also why we really. concentrate in last year and even more so in this year on our management actions. We've. explained to more than once we will increase rates. There might be more commutations. and other things. So this is also why the expectation for the year 2018 is not really brilliant,. but that gives us room to implement those changes to really concentrate on the action to. then also in the future reflect the real profitability of that segment again.. A brief look at the value creation of new business, so the future profits, those who have. been here in October, might remember Claude shared this presentation where he. explained how the value of new business then translates into IFRS profits in the future.. You see that this is going down. We've really had in 2015 and 2016 remarkably large loss –. large transactions which came with really high value of new business.. So on the one hand, this number goes down, yes. But on the other hand, and you see that. it is still remarkably above our hurdle. So the target is €220 million. We have achieved. €364 million. So this is really an outperformance year even though it looks so decreased.. So we are happy with the new business, which was created and produced in 2017 and. which will translate into future profits according to the patterns which we tried to explain in. October. These came from the U.S., Asia, from Australia, from around the world.. So here now, Uli mentioned before, it is the ordinary – the investment income was. exceptionally good in 2017. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I might not make 3.8% in the current. year again. Still you might remember we came into the year with 2.7% as a target. We've. increased the target to 3%. Now, we came in with 3.8%, of course, aided by the sale of. the equities. But also the ordinary investment income is up remarkably, double-digit. increase.. Why is that? How could it be? It was helped by private equity fund distributions. Some of. them have a little bit an extraordinary touch. They will not reoccur, but the overall level will. also be very attractive in the future. Moreover, we have increased our investments in real. estate, and also that is performing really well. And that boosts also the ordinary income. and that should be sustainable.. Realized gains/losses of course boosted by the sale of the equity portfolio. We've. commented more than once on that. Impairments, appreciation, depreciation, that line is,. well, nearly in line with the current year, nothing extraordinary, the majority of that is. ordinary depreciation on our real estate portfolio, so really nothing extraordinary here.. Same goes for the fair value instruments through P&L and the investment expenses.. A brief look at the unrealized gains and losses, you see that – and we've seen them to. some extent already in the capital position, here, this goes down slightly. Why doesn't it. go down more if you have realized €220 million in listed equities here? One has to bear in. mind a lot of that potential of the realizations has been created in 2017. So approximately. €100 million had already existed when we entered into 2017. The rest of the appreciation. happened in 2017. This is why the hidden reserves are only affected by – or the valuation. reserves are only affected by €100 million. Still, we have to bear in mind this number is no. longer that high today. We've seen interest rate increases. We've seen that the credit. spreads in the U.S. dollar, as well as in the euro, have increased slightly. So this number is. still around €1 billion, I would say, but it is decreasing. Is that a problem? Actually, not really.. I think the capital position would still be high.. Maybe worth mentioning, the reinvestment yield, also that is something which we. explained in a lot of detail in October here, is around 2.05%. On this pro forma basis, if I. sell everything today, reinvest the same thing today and have no changes in the. composition, the reinvestment yield would be 2.05%. And if we look at the projections. which we did and which we gave you there is no reason to think that the projections today. would have a different result. So on that regard, at least on the one hand, we are losing. higher rates.. On the next page, you see the comparison where we invested on the assets under own. management and where does the profits come from. You see real estate and private. equity, especially private equity in the year 2017. Extraordinary, 2% on the allocation and. 13% of the income, 5% real estate, 13% of the income, so these are the main contributors,. we also see that, of course, that the government here, it I with the (00:41:39) portfolios,. it's vice versa. But nothing extraordinary that goes, same goes for the composition of the. investment portfolio as it stands today.. We have been explaining the Barbell strategy over the last years to some extent. You can. see it, at least on the government portfolio, which has increased here, that is the one part. of the Barbell, then the non-investment grade assets have also increased, and was also. the listed equity – sorry, the private equity and the real estate have been increasing. This. has come to an end. Now we will no longer continue with the Barbell strategy. We are. where we wanted to be.. In the future, we will invest across the board again. Well, with a little bit of higher quality on. the credit side, I think this is what we have decided early this year, and in so far, again, with. the Barbell, we are where we wanted to be, and now we might change or decrease. spread duration a little bit. Otherwise, no fundamental changes to the portfolio.. Let me comment then on the Solvency II reporting as at December 2017. Please bear in. mind, we will publish the full Solvency II reporting in May with – including the FSCR (sic). [SFCR] (00:43:22) and analysis of change. So economic P&L today, we can present some. key figures and we should bear in mind that they are not finally audited, I should mention. that, so slight changes might be necessary. Still, we don't expect them to happen.. The available capital that we have, these internal metrics where we distinguish today only. the minority interests where we feel they are fungible enough to use them as capital in. our internal model, the Solvency II BaFin approved numbers exclude them, they force us. to apply the haircut, and that is the difference between the two numbers. You see that. the available capital eligible on funds have decreased by some €500 million. That is again. driven by the currency exchange rates, same effects which we have discussed more than. once in that presentation I warned you at the beginning. And here, it is quite obvious that. the same happens on the required capital side as well. Here also, the currency exchange. rates decreases or increases, the strengthening of the euro has impacted the required. capital positions remarkably, so our cat exposures in the U.S. dollar go down and all the. others' exposures go down as well.. Moreover, the market risk goes down based on the sale of the listed equities, plus we. have the impact was also – Uli mentioned already that the operational risk is also now. calculated based on a stochastic approach so we can use it from an internal model point. of view and no longer use the standard model. The interesting thing here or the funny. thing here is that they do not result in such different numbers. But if we use the stochastic. methods, we can use the diversification effect. So they now diversify, which was not. allowed according to the standard model. And that also increases the diversification. remarkably, and that leads to an increase of the solvency ratio from 230% to 260%.. You see that here on the next page, where the risks come from, the P&C, the Life &. Health and the market risk plus the diversification, and then how here the required capital. especially the market risk has come down, and the diversification has improved. remarkably.. The next page summarizes that I think nicely over a three-year horizon from 221% to. 230% and 260%. You see also here the internal limits and threshold systems, which. demonstrates even as the capital position went down slightly, the solvency position here. increased remarkably. As well, I think this summarizes the development on the next page.. The usual translation from the IFRS shareholders' equity to the basic own funds on the. right hand side, we have to add some effects from the asset portfolio, for instance, all. those investments which are accounted for at amortized cost hold to maturity bucket. This. has to be added. We also see that the technical provisions are adjusted. That is the. discounting of loss reserves, the future gains on the Life side.. These are additions then, those additions have to be taxed which goes the other way.. Then we have to deduct the foreseeable dividends, which is the increased number now.. And I explained to you already the minority haircut. Then we add our hybrid baskets to. that, and we have also given you the number of the potential hybrid issuance we could. do, which would fully be accepted here and increase our capital position which is nearly. €1.3 billion. So if we needed that capital, we could issue it tomorrow, and that then. explains how you come from the IFRS shareholders' capital position to the solvency, basic. own funds on the right hand side.. I think that then leads us to the target matrix. And usually, Uli, that is something which only. a CEO can explain.. Ulrich Wallin. Absolutely, Roland. And I will of course do that. Thank you. So, I mean you can see even in. a year like 2017, we have more ticks than not (00:48:54), which if you want to put it. positively, shows the resilience of our business model situations like we had seen in 2017.. That's actually good that we show this resilience, because it's not really a tail event what. happened in 2017, but something we have to expect, I would say, every five to seven. management that prepares us to those kind of years.. If you look at two things where we didn't managed tick marks which is the xRoCA, which is. account risk-free interest rates, not the nice earnings from sale of the equities. But still, on. more on an economic basis on the P&C side than the cost of capital.. that's a positive number in the light of the NatCat losses, which exceeded the large loss. budget or the expected losses by more than €300 million. Flipside of that, if you look at. the Life & Health, you see a negative xRoCA, and that really shows you the additional. technical provisions on an economic balance sheet and the Solvency II balance sheet,. which reflects the additional expected future losses from the U.S. mortality business. But. that also tells you that those developments are included in the solvency ratio of the 260%.. So I wanted to mention those which I normally not do because I normally dwell on those. where we have tick marks but not today.. That brings us then to the outlook for next year. And I thought with the P&C some weeks. ago, we gave you – we had our renewal call, and not only we gave you the preliminary. results, we also gave you the results of the renewal season at 1/1/2018, which overall were. actually quite positive for us because we could generate higher rates. Also in this. environment, due to our competitive position and our low admin expense ratio, we were. able to grow both our traditional business, as well as our structured reinsurance business.. So overall, the growth of the business being renewed at 1/1/2018 came actually to 21%.. However, as the renewal season did not show the rate increases that many people might. have hoped for, including us, I would say, because I mean as Roland already alluded to,. we have the theory, every time the average ROE of the reinsurance market falls below. 5%, there will be a reaction from the market like we had seen in 2009 and 2012. This was. not that remarkable in 2018. Main reason that none of the capacities were withdrawn. (00:52:54), which was different in 2009 and 2012, with some capacities were withdrawn. Most of the underwriting units on the P&C side were waiting for significant marketchanging events, and of course trying to increase their capacities rather than decrease. their capacities following the losses. So all we have seen is an increased underwriting. discipline of the underwriters and the loss-driven hardening. The shares have not moved a. lot even in the Caribbean (00:53:35), which of course have an extremely high loss ratio.. None of the capacities were (00:53:40) strong, so the panels of reinsurer (00:53:42). actually remained more or less unchanged admittedly at higher rate. But there was no. opportunity for new players coming in or existing players significantly increasing their lines.. So I think what that really shows in years like 2017, we have to expect that we have to. continue to deal with a very competitive market, and we have to look for competitive. advantages in order to be successful in those market. It's not good enough to say, well,. there's a lot of losses in a year like this, but I make it all up by the rate increases in the. following year. That, on this kind of loss level, does no longer work.. Then of course, if I go to the individual sub-segments, North America and Continental. Europe, both are very broad books that we have serviced very many clients. We were. actually pleased with the outcome of the renewal season. We already had a very good. profitability of our Continental European business in 2017. We have seen on average rate. increases of that business. So we are very positive. Of course, North America was. affected by the hurricane losses and got pretty much rate increases across the board but. only moderate. On the specialty lines, mixed picture.. Credit and surety, we saw some increase as we increased our market-leading position. UK. and Ireland for Ogden-driven increases, even though we feel that the market responded. a little less pronounced than we would've liked to see to the Ogden rate changes,. because really the current rates that were charged for 2018, according to our. assessment, did not reflect the minus 0.75% Ogden rates that is the legal prevailing rate. now. Admittedly, it hasn't been used as yet. So there's an argument to use a higher one. but we feel that the market should have gone with the official rates. So we're a little bit. disappointed with that, which meant that yes, we have more premium, but we are. significantly less exposed on that business.. Aviation, very interesting, still very, very competitive, but quite remarkable that 2017 was. the first year where we didn't have a single fatality in commercial airline travel, quite. remarkable, very good job of the airlines. Worldwide reinsurance and catastrophe excess. of losses, we see growth worldwide reinsurance particularly in China that we were able to. improve our position on some key clients. We have a strategic important client approach. and initiatives that we have for the last few years. And that is actually bearing fruit. This. year in particular in China and Australia, but there are also other areas where this. approach is actually quite helpful.. Structured reinsurance and ILS, both increased quite significantly, we had more than 50%. increase of our structured reinsurance book again at 1/1/2018. And actually, on our largest. treaty, we expect per underwriting year a margin, just to give you an idea, of around $45. million, which may be earned over two years.. So this business is not only top line accretive, it's also bottom line accretive. That, to the. 2018 year, so we expect that we have – we'll be above the margin requirements. If you. put 2018 in perspective, we expect that it will have a better rating quality on a fiscal year. compared to 2017, not quite as good as 2016 on a fiscal year on an underwriting year, it is. better than 2017 and 2016, but falls short of 2015.. On the Life & Health side, our financial solutions business will see increasing profits. That's. almost certain at this point in time because the business is on the books. And the risks. (00:58:38), the transactions are risk-removed (00:58:40), so that the probability that we. will actually achieve these increased profits is very high. Longevity, I mean, I should also. say that the premium volume on the financial solutions is not so important, because a. number of the transactional deposit accounted and – are not showing up as top line on. the books. Longevity, we see a stable development at profitability that is sufficient to. cover the cost of capital. However, there, we have a number of larger transactions in the. pipeline, particular also outside the UK. So depending on our success on these. transactions, we may even see an increase in premium.. Otherwise, because of the long duration of the underlying business, the same premium. volume is pretty much a given, because we have seen some reduction in our enhanced. annuity business in the last couple of years due to change in the legal environment, but. that has come to an end. I mean, that is – will no longer reduce.. This is a little bit difficult to gauge at this point in time because it will depend on the. recaptures and will also depend on the additional premiums that we are able to already. At this point in time, we're not expecting to lose money on mortality because the non-U.S.. mortality business as well as the new business in the U.S. continues to perform in line with. expectation. Actually on our non-U.S. mortality business, the EBIT margin is around 8%.. Morbidity, it's basically critical illness and some health business where we expect some. growth because there's additional demand for that business, in particular in Asia and. China, and we expect to earn the cost of (01:01:14).. Putting that all together, that brings us to an unchanged guidance. We see single-digit. percentage growth of the premium, which currency adjusted will likely be double-digit on. the P&C side and quite stable on the life and health side. So it might be the higher end of. double-digit.. Return on investment, of course, we are not hitting the benchmark that we have set in. 2017 of the 3.8%, but rather expect 2.7% which is based on the current portfolio. It's also. based on what Roland mentioned, some derisking on the credit exposure, particularly on. the higher yielding bonds where we feel that the pricings are at a level where it's difficult. to see that the spreads could tighten even further, and they actually have done the. opposite in recent years.. But with the 2.7%, we still should reach an absolute return in the region, say, of €1.1 billion. which is in line with the five-year average except if you exclude the effects and the profits. from the sale of the quoted equities. We also have to have a policy that might also put us. back into quoted equities, but it would need a more significant correction of the market. than we currently have seen.. Profitability more than €1 billion will, of course, be driven by an expected increased. underwriting result from the P&C side where we feel that we are in a good position. We. have better underlying rating quality than we had last year. We continue to have a very. good level of redundancies and our loss reserves and we have not increased our risk. appetite for cat on a net basis so that also the volatility to both cat losses is pretty much. at an unchanged level. So from that point of view, we feel we are (1:03:44) positioned on. the P&C side.. Dividend payout ratio, I mean we have shown the 260% Solvency ratio. We have got. dividend paying abilities from a German GAAP balance sheet and P&L account, so if. everything goes according to plan and say if the first three bullet points are come to. reality on this one, it is more likely than not that we will continue to pay a dividend at least. on the level of the current year.. I realize that this is an annuity promise, however, I put it to the providers that of course. that would meet the other three bullet points to be fulfilled. But I mean, the dividend. paying capacity is definitely there. This would allow us to have at least dividend continuity.. If I then go to the individual business groups as well as the investments, property/casualty. as I said, we feel well-positioned with our business in 2018. We think that our combined. ratio should go back to below or equal to 96%, despite the fact that the portion of the. advanced solutions business for the structured reinsurance business is growing, which. comes in at combined ratios between 98% and 100%. But still, we feel that the overall. underlying profitability of the business should support the 96%, even without reducing the. confidence level of our loss reserves significantly.. So we expect that we will stay above our threshold on the upper end of our threshold on. the – I mean, sufficiency level of our loss reserves. We also feel that we should gain. modestly on our market share, which we have done at 1/1/2018 because we have grown a. little bit faster than the market overall.. U.S., has continued to perform excellently. On the U.S. mortality, as I said, we expect. further losses. That is also why we were a little bit more cautious on our EBIT expectation.. We are now seeing around €200 million, and the reason for that is the aggressive in-force. management actions that we are performing that could lead to recaptures, which could. produce losses in 2018. They would not shy away from those because what it really would. mean is they would reduce the outstanding liabilities on this rather problematic book that. we were buying in the first quarter 2009, which in hindsight did not turn out to be our best. decision.. VNB, we have a lot of new business initiatives and therefore we are very confident that. the value of new business will be in excess of our target. On the investment income, not a. lot to say. I already told you we will be around $1.1 billion, but our expectation is, give or. take, maybe we'll see opportunity because we have been used to that to which we. outperform that a little bit. So overall, we are looking positive into the current year.. Thank you very much, and I now look forward to your questions.. Q&A. Karl Steinle. Well, thank you. We will now begin with our question-and-answer session. Just as a. reminder, please wait for the microphone so that everybody can hear your question, even. those who are not in the room. We shall proceed first with the questions from the. attendees in the room and then move on to the questions coming in from the conference. call. So I see already some hands up. We start with from Kopfinger and then continue with. Andreas Schäfer.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Thank you. It's Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. So my first question is on your. guidance or your outlook for 2018, obviously you left your guidance or your outlook. unchanged with the over €1 billion profit target and all the other drivers, however, you. have this reduction in the life EBIT, can you comment on where the offset is coming from. to keep the overall target outlook stable?. And then secondly, on your outlook for the life, re: EBIT of around about €200 billion for. 2018, you commented that this is driven by more accelerated in-force management and. potentially higher recapturings. At your Investor Day you guided toward – that this. recapturing action might take until earlier or mid-2019. Can you comment there also on. the timeline if you have now this drag in 2018?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you for those questions. I mean, our guidance on the profit for 2018, of course. that's more than €1 billion, and the range of more than €1 billion that we have seen in 2016. can also extend to numbers which are a little bit higher than €1 billion. We see the. profitability largely driven by our PNC business. And I mean, we feel – and at least our. current expectation which we do on a regular basis suggests that even with the $200. million EBIT, or even if it's a little bit below the remainder of the PNC business and the. investment will be able to carry the more than one big enough profitability.. The timeline on the in-force management action, we have brought that forward so we will. be acting more swiftly and earlier than originally expected. Therefore, the majority of the. effects from the in-force management should actually occur in 2018 and not drag over. into 2019. We have brought – we have accelerated our efforts there because as you can. probably appreciate, we'd like to solve this problem sooner rather than later, and. therefore we have brought it a little bit further.. Why do we have negative effects from these in-force management actions at all? The. reason for that is that when we bought the ING portfolio or we took it in our books on. purchase GAAP accounting, which means on certain treaties, particularly why our treaties. have negative reserves, and if they come out plus some unearned premium, by recapture. it has a negative effect.. Karl Steinle. Can you just hand over the microphone to your colleague behind you? Thank you.. Andreas Schäf er. Thank you. Andreas Schäfer, Bankhaus Lampe. Just two questions. One of the. development of your NatCat losses, gross and net. During the first three quarters, the. losses on a gross basis went down by €140 million, but on a net basis went up by roughly. €70 million which explain the differential between net and gross development. And the. follow-up question on life and health, as far as I understand, the guidance for 2019 in. terms of EBIT should be now at least unchanged or rather up compared to what you said. before, and given the fact that you now accelerated the recapturing program to 2018. Is. that the case?. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. If I get to the first one, the second question first and then go in the opposite. direction. Well, it could be if all our clients would simply accept the rate increases that. would be exactly the case. But that is not that likely because, I mean, the experience also. of other companies on these actions at that certain percentage of the treaties are being. recaptured and that would have more likely a negative effect. So the acceleration of the. in-force management action is likely to be detrimental to the IFRS earnings in 2018, but is. accretive to the IFRS earnings in 2019.. The NatCat losses were coming down on Hurricane Irma which meant that they are no. longer in our whole account protection, and therefore the reduction in the reserves. exclusively benefited our retrocessionaires. On the other hand, we saw some increases. on Hurricane Maria, which however had not reached the whole account protection. So. both losses are now in a good position to safeguard future increases because both of. them sit right at the attachment point of the whole account protection.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Then we continue with Jochen Schmitt from Bankhaus Metzler and then with Ivan.. Jochen Schmitt. Thank you. Jochen Schmitt from Metzler. Just one question on the dividend, the Solvency II. position of 260%, what prevented you from opting for, say, somewhat higher dividend. payout for last year?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I guess mainly the growth of our business. So growth of our business and also of. course the result was not quite as good as the year before, and therefore we opted to. have an unchanged payout. rather than then to increase the payout again because due to. the higher percentage of the IFRS profit that we paid out mitigating the growth of our. capital base and original currency was fulfilled even this limiting the dividend payment of. €5.. Also, of course, two things. I mean, we have to look at the dividend of the current year but. we also have to look at the long-term continuity of the dividend. And I mean, we only paid. out part of our German GAAP profits that our dividend paying capacity for the coming. years is actually a lot better than it used to be, and our dividend continuity that way is. more comfortably safeguarded than it was before.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays.. Ivan Bokhmat. I have a few questions on the life business. So firstly, you mentioned that the financial. solutions do contribute the revenues that are booked as other. So the question would be. how sustainable are they and how should we think about them going forward?. And secondly, the question also related to life, I think you've given up or you said you're. going to give up the target for margins for individual blocks of businesses, longevity,. mortality, financial solutions. Maybe you can comment on why you think that's the right. approach.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, first on the financial solutions, whilst the treaties are not comparable in the duration. to, say, longevity or traditional mortality treaty where the durations can go up to 50, 60. years if it's a permanent business, on the financial solutions business, the majority of our. deals are. three to five years, and the longest that we have is 20 years. But we also have continue –. we also continuously write new business, and we have a very vivid underwriting practice in. our financial solutions, particularly in the U.S. where we are able continually to grow the. business. I mean, the business, normally a lot of that comes towards the end of the year.. So the production of 2017 to some extent the new production becomes effective only in. 2018, and therefore we think that this is quite a sustainable revenue stream. And the goal,. of course, is to increase the profits from the financial reinsurance double-digit year-onyear. The last few years we were able to do that.. Why did we not have the EBIT margin by line of business and change that to just an EBIT. growth target? The reason for that is that the business is very diverse. If you look at the. financial lines, we have deposit accounted business where the EBIT margin is endless. because there is no premium. We have like out of the many surplus (01:20:19) business. where the EBIT margin is expected to be 100%, and we have cash financing business. where the EBIT margin is normally around 2%. Because, I mean, you finance embedded. value or acquisition costs, and then of course you get sufficient amount of premium. seated that the profit stream from that business is sufficient to pay off the pre-finance. amounts which are pre-financed by commission. And then you of course look for kind of. what we call a loan-to-value ratio, for lack of a better word, that is normally around 60%, I. would say. But then you need quite a lot of premium for that payback depending on the. underlying profitability of the business that's ceded to you.. Likewise on mobility, it's really a mixed bag. I mean, some of the less volatile businesses,. the margin may only be 2% to 3% of the business where the volatility is higher like in Latin. America. We have margins that go up to double digit. So it's a mixed bag and the. question whether or not – how it moves really depends on the development of the mix of. business, and therefore we thought we might be misguiding to some extent and said,. well, we certainly want to have as a growth in the EBIT year-on-year and therefore we. changed that. That is the answer to those questions.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Then we have the next question from Roland Pfänder and we continue with Michael. Haid.. Roland Pf änder. Good afternoon. Roland Pfänder, ODDO BHF. Coming back to your U.S. recaptures you. are planning. Could you talk about the amount of price increases you are trying to put into. the market, maybe you could provide also a timeframe when you think that will be handed. over to customers and the negotiating timetable? And maybe the question what would. be different if clients would not accept any recaptures? How much different would be the. running EBIT number for the next years to come? Second question. I saw you are more. positive on credit and surety business in terms of profitability compared to last year, what. has changed your view on that? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, firstly on the recaptures, we're not planning for recaptures. I mean we would have. no problems if everybody does accepts the rate increases because that would be. accretive to the EBIT. And we would have no negative vibes. I mean, if everybody would. actually accept our rate increases, we would of course have an EBIT which would certainly. be above $350 million. But we are not expecting that. We expect to see recaptures.. On the percentage, I'm not sure if it's the best communication strategy if I announce that. here. I think my lawyer's telling me that's not the best idea. So we have, I mean, a. communications strategy there does not call for me to announce the rate increases here. and now. We are planning to move in the second quarter.. Credit and surety. I mean, we had combined ratio, I think, of 90% last year so we were. quite pleased with that. And we have seen some rate increases on our credit and surety. business so, I mean, on an apples to apples basis, it should slightly improve. Of course it. also depends on, I mean, insolvencies and large losses whether or not we are having. them.. Michael Haid. Thank you. Michael Haid, Commerzbank. Two questions. Trying to – I'm still trying to. understand and I struggle a little bit with the €1.1 billion run-off profits and reserve. releases. Obviously, there are some moving parts in there. I understand that some of this. €1.1 billion comes from a reserve or our reserve releases from reserve redundancies, and. some actually run-off profits. When you settle the claim, and these are probably not – or. these were not included in the reserve redundancies at the beginning. So can you say. how much of the €1.1 billion was already in the pool of the €1.9 billion reserve. redundancies? That's my first question. And the second question, can you provide a. quarterly breakdown of this €1.06 billion reserve releases or run-off profits?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, these questions are sufficiently complicated that I will hand over to Roland.. Roland Vogel. Well, first of all, I think we've mentioned more than once that these – to start with your. latter question first, that these detailed analyses really needs a full analysis of the loss. reserves, of the ultimate loss ratios which we've booked and all that, and this is done on a. yearly basis. What we do give you quarterly is an educated estimate of the development. of the runoffs. And the confidence level to give you that breakdown quarterly would not. be possible today. Still, there is still the commitment to give you an idea as to whether the. confidence level went up or down.. To your first question, yes, you're right. I think we mentioned one big runoff from the. aviation event of 2001. That has not been regarded as a redundancy before so that runoff. had no impact on the €1.9 billion you've mentioned.. The same would be true I didn't mention that before for approximately €100 million from. our Bermudian cap portfolio. Also, here there is a rather straightforward policy which we. have agreed upon with our auditors that after we – even if we really reserve. conservatively after three years with no loss advice, we release those loss reserves.. That are in the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately €100 million. And also these. event driven reserves beforehand are not treated as being redundant so that gives you. some indications. Moreover, especially the Ogden rates releases which we have seen. already in the Q2 that had been regarded redundancy before.. In that regard, the €300 million should have in your (01:28:02) if I try to follow that, should. have decreased the large loss reserve redundancy. And then there were others. I did. mention before some commutations, which included some asbestos reserves. And also,. these were not regarded being redundant beforehand.. So there were quite some parts of the positive runoff result did, by nature, not affect the. redundancy number. And for those which did affect the redundancy numbers, we have. kind of set up the current year's combined ratios and ultimate loss ratios assumptions,. again, conservatively enough that we are confident to assume that overall, the additions. for the past have been set up again very conservatively so that there is, again, created. redundancy for the years to come and that had led us to the effect or to the message. that the confidence level, at least percentage-wise, should be the same, again, with the. impact of the currencies. In absolute terms it might have come down slightly.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much.. Karl Steinle. Okay. We have some further questions from the room, but from the conference call, and. we start with the first question from Kamran Hossain from RBC.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, everyone. I'm sorry I couldn't be there in the room. Two questions from me. First of all,. could you give an indication of what your surplus is on an S&P basis,. like if you have an idea of that? So, I guess that's probably the binding constraint for you. on capital.. And secondly, I guess, with a really, really strong capital ratio, would you consider M&A?. Any thought from that, I guess, as activity seems to be picking up at the moment. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. The service on the S&P model has actually come down quite a bit due to a model. change. As that S&P is applying, particular on the pension swaps of the longevity business. and the asset liability matching, which means that unfortunately, up until that change, the. S&P ratio and the Solvency II ratio were actually quite in sync with the Solvency II ratio even. a little bit lower than the S&P ratio.. This change, which, in my humble opinion, I would say, was not well-founded, let alone. communicated of course, makes S&P more difficult. I mean, we still have higher than the. AA rating S&P solvency ratio. But of course, the excess capital on S&P has reduced,. remarkable. Still, S&P – I mean, have confirmed our AA- rating, confirms the stable outlook.. And actually, our – an analyst on S&P told us not to worry whatever that's good for.. But yeah, I mean, that is the situation on S&P. We don't really see it as much of a binding. constraint at this point in time because they also have told us if we fall below AA for a. while, it's not a problem. And we still have a lot of dry powder on the hybrid capital. So, it's. a manageable problem, and so we would not see that as a binding constraint of our. growth.. We will continue to steer the business based on the internal model because, of course,. it's not that easy to steer your business on a model that has these rather significant. changes on short notice. I have to say that even though we left S&P, as you know, we were. the first European company that got rated in Europe from S&P. So, our relationship with. them is very good and you might remember that at the beginning, they were so excited. about us that they even gave us a AAA but that's a long time ago. On M&A, they have. currently nothing we are working at.. Kamran Hossain",20180313_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2018-3-13_FS000000002411079163.pdf,2018-03-13
14,"Good afternoon to everybody here in London at the Stock Exchange, and good afternoon. to all of those joining us via the Internet. Welcome to Hannover Re's Analyst Conference.. It's my pleasure to see that so many of you have taken up our invitation and showing. therefore your interest in Hannover Re. Due to leading requirements, we had to release. the key figures already four weeks ago. Today, we are delighted to present to you the full. set of numbers in greater detail.. I must say that I'm rather impressed by your work over the past year. In total, you. published all together, at least to my knowledge, more than 270 reports on Hannover Re. and/or the reinsurance market, and this is about 30% more than in the previous year and. that reflects your efforts to help and to steer investors through the current market. environment. Thanks for your support and your hard work, and please do keep it up.. Today, we are also offering a dial-in option for all those who were not able to be physically. here in London. As a reminder, the dial-in participants will be in a listen-only mode during. the presentations. If any participant has difficulty to hear the conference, please press the. star key and zero on your telephone keypad for operator assistance.. I would also like to draw your attention to the feedback questionnaire which we have. distributed in advance and which you will find on your desk. As you know, we greatly. appreciate your remarks because it lays the foundation for the preparation of our. Investors Day in October. Feel free to either leave the feedback form at the table or send. it in to Julia, Axel (sic) [Alex] (02:15), or myself.. First of all, Ulrich Wallin, our CEO, will kick things off with a brief overview of the 2016. financial year. Roland Vogel, our CFO, will then move on to present the financials in details.. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond at length to all your questions. And I would like to. point out that would you please wait for the microphone before asking questions so. everybody can understand your question, even those who are not in the room today.. On that note, I'm delighted to hand over to Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, Karl. Maybe you give me the first slide as well. Good afternoon also from. me and thanks for coming on this lovely day in London. We put the headline of our current. strategy cycle for three years and we change our strategy every three years. The current. one is titled Long-term Success in a Competitive Business. And I can tell you our business. is competitive. So that part is true, but we also have the fifth consecutive year of record. results. So we feel maybe we're going towards the long-term success as well.. As Karl already mentioned, we gave you preliminary results about four weeks ago. because our parent company who owns us for 50% did so, and we didn't want everybody. to speculate until today what our contribution to their numbers might be. What we didn't. tell you then is that we plan to pay a dividend of €5 per share for 2016, which is an. increase in the ordinary dividend from €3.25 to €3.50 and an unchanged extraordinary. dividend. We increased the ordinary dividend because we wanted to stay within the range. of 35% to 40% of the IFRS group results.. While most of the news is pretty good for 2016, however, the top-line has been. decreasing slightly in line with our expectation. This has to do with the continued soft. market on the P&C side which means that we have to underwrite our business more. selectively and we clearly put result over premium income at this market cycle and this is. showing here.. We also saw decreased premiums in the Life & Health business that has to do with some. last single premium transactions in China which continue to run, but we have not been. writing any new ones unless they are single premiums as they are not showing up in the. top-line this year and next year.. The other element is the UK-enhanced annuities. We continue to see decreasing. premiums there due to the change in the tax environment here in the UK where you can. more easily and more tax efficient take a lump sum from your pension fund and do not –. so the advantage of buying an annuity is not as large as it used to be and as a result of. that, less annuities being bought.. The bottom-line results look pretty decent; considering the low interest rate environment. and the soft market on the P&C side, also considering that as you know last year we had a. positive one-off effect to the tune of around €40 million which of course as it was a oneoff, was not reoccurring and we didn't have another one-off to supplement it. So that had. to be made up by the normal results of the business. And yes, we see group net income,. €1.17 billion. We are slightly larger than the income was for 2015, and so in our 50th year of. the existence of Hannover Re, we were able to report another record year. Remarkable. increase of the IFRS capital of the company by 11.5% that was more than €900 million,. which meant that also the book value per share is close to €75, is also at an all-time high.. Since 2016 for the first time, we measure our solvency ratio through the Solvency II. regulatory framework where we have for the quantitative risk, our internal capital model. being improved by the (08:20) both for the Hannover Re SE, as well as for the Hannover. Re Group. And it's actually a partial model because the operational risk is added to the. modeled results based on the standard formula. We are discussing with regulators to. change that hopefully for 2018. That capital ratio stands at 230%, which is an increase. from 220% where we were at the beginning of the year, and that increase is largely the. result of increased retained earnings.. P&C business, we had very good year. The combined ratio, 30% – 93.7%. It's, of course,. abated (09:27) what the underlying quality of the underwriting result has been. I mean as. we do every year than computing the year-end result, we ask Willis Towers Watson to. give us a pre-study of our reserves. And then, of course – I mean that reflects like, of our. overall P&C reserves close to 80%. And then of course, we do the final studies. We. finalize it throughout the year and we show that to you at our Investors' Days every year,. as you know.. This year, according to that, we have a little bit lift in the redundancies, but not a lot. I. mean, in and large, I would say the redundancy level has kept flat. Therefore, we would. say that the reported combined ratio pretty much reflects the quality of the business.. However, in previous year, when we were adding to the buffer, of course the underlying. business was a bit better than we were actually reporting. That is, to a large extent, not. the case this year.. Of course, there is a little bit interesting statistic that we show in our annual report where. you see positive runoff results of previous year's loss reserves of around a little bit more. than €800 million. This number has increased a bit also due to the fact that we continue. to add to the buffers and, of course, in the old years, first in the Property business, the. short-term business but then gradually also in the long-term business. If those are actually. redundant loss reserves, what you expect once the losses get settled, there's no reason. to keep them and you can't keep them. And that's a reason for the increasing positive. runoff result.. The other thing is that, I mean there's always something going wrong every year. I mean. this year, of course, we have the change in the (11:56) tables which will create some. negative development on the loss reserves for the UK motor business. So that will, of. course, not show at positive in the run-off results.. I will come to the (12:14) tables later when I talk about next year, but I mean the high. positive run-off result also shows you that, again in 2016, nothing went really wrong. I. mean, we didn't have anything like U.S. transportation or some umbrella reserves or. something like this (12:37) developed adversely. We didn't have anything like this in 2016.. So that also is the reason for the very positive run-off results. Otherwise, large losses in. 2016 slightly about 10% above 2015, but still below the results that we saw – still below the. budget.. Life & Health, I would call it a solid result. It's not as good as we reported last year. because the lack of the one-off effect. It continues to be as we expected. I mean at the. Investors' Day, I showed you a slide saying that the EBIT in the next few years will be. between €300 million and €350 million. We come in at €343 million, so well within that. range. So, pretty much in accordance with expectation, but the individual segments have. developed quite heterogeneously. We had, again, a very positive result from the financial. solutions business, not quite as profitable as last year because last year we had the oneoff effect and deadline. Our French branch business is back into profitability. So that's the. €65 million positive swing, but at the same time, we continue to have some negative. results in the first three quarters on the large block of U.S. mortality business that we. purchased in 2008.. We also had random increase of frequency and larger claims in the fourth quarter, and. therefore, that has nothing to do with the U.S. mortality in this case for change, also. nothing to do with the French branch. It was just randomly higher claims which happens in. a quarter. So the fourth quarter in Life & Health wasn't quite so strong.. Overall, as I've said I think quite a solid result. And on the investment side, 3% return on. investment from assets under management, also aided by some realized gains pretty. much in accordance with expectation even little bit better than that. But I will leave the. details of the number to Roland and only give you the positive overview.. Roland Vogel. Thank you, Uli. At least you stole a little bit of powder, but I think that is your right as a. CEO to do that. Based on your comments, it seems as if we could concentrate on. reserves and U.S. mortality and dividends. We have a little bit more with us, and I will guide. you through those numbers briefly. I will try to concentrate on some messages and. comments and start with the cash flow number.. As you can see, the €2.3 billion operating cash flow, far higher than the net income. number which also I emphasized here a little bit because it should give us a little bit an. indication about reserve developments, at least a positive cash flow over and above the. net income numbers, and the numbers we earned on the investment side should give us. a little bit of certainty that the reserves haven't been weakened. And as Uli mentioned,. this seems obviously to be a little bit the topic of the day and we will come to that.. The €2.3 billion look a little bit volatile as compared to last year. Early last year, we did. adjust the numbers for one large Chinese contract where we showed before the end of. the year, got €500 million in. Early 2016, €300 million went out. If we adjust for that, which. we haven't done because we want to comply with the numbers as presented in the. Annual Report, 2016 would have even be slightly better, only slightly better than 2015.. So very reliable, stable cash flow number which also is reflected in the assets under our. management on left hand side. €42 billion nearly, that increase driven by exchange rates,. by free additional cash flow and also small increase in valuation reserves as you will see. on the next slide.. Uli mentioned already that our shareholders' equity number went up another double digit. percentage points with 11.5% or €900 million. If you go back to 2012, you see that that. number even increased by approximately 50%. In 2016, you see the composition on the. right hand side. Here, the net income as the major contributor then the dividend payment. – last year's dividend payment which also included to special dividends, then additional. contributions from the variation reserves and small contributions also from the currency. translation which then end with nearly €9 billion of shareholders' equity on the left hand. side.. You'll still see that grey – sorry, the green bar up there, which represents our issued hybrid. capital. We will come to that later on, that there is potential to even increase more if that. would be needed.. The dividend per share, Uli mentioned the dividend policy, I think there is nothing to add. too much. I think in 2009 when there were some changes in management and we were. trying to get more stability in dividend payments than before. If you look at the numbers. here, I think we achieved that to quite some extent last three years where we didn't have. that much growth, where the large losses came in under budget, where the capital. position was positive.. We did pay the special portions of the dividends. That continues in 2017. I don't see any. reason why the composition of the dividend next year wouldn't look alike. Of course, we. also – we always know that things can happen, but I think as demonstrated here, a rather. reliable and hopefully transparent approach to paying dividends.. Now, the ROE, our major profitability target and indicator. You see on the left hand side,. the development of the E, which has always been increasing over the course of the time.. Now, the profits were keeping up with that to quite some extent. We've added, if you. compare this slide to the previous one, additional percentage point numbers which. represent the spread over and above risk free and the 900 basis points which represent. our strategic profitability target.. So this spread over and above the thresholds or our strategic goal is rather in line or. rather stable. Yes, it had been even better last year, but with the 3.8% in 2016 that. compares with 3.9%, I think that should demonstrate that the profitability or the excess. profitability we have been providing is again rather stable although the ROEs go down. slightly with the increase of the E. But also we should bear in mind that the risk free rates. go down as well.. You see on the right hand side that the portion over and above the threshold even has. been increasing. If we compare 15 years or 10 years or the 5 year average where the. excess profitability was even larger than in the long-term comparisons.. A little bit of different picture as we are used to for quite some time. We had been. number one here. And it's, from my point of view, interesting to see the reason why we. are only at number two this year, because it's not the year 2016 which has been added,. because in 2016, we are still number one. So the reason why we lost the prime position. here is the 2011 year which went out. You might remember that 2011 was the year of the. second largest natural catastrophe burden. So we had, you could say, outperformed our. competitors in 2011 so remarkably that the absence of that year now leads to us being. and have downgraded to number two.. The chart will also give you the indication that if we would have higher losses natural. catastrophes over and above the expected levels, again we would expect to potentially. add another year 2011 again and show more reliable numbers.. Other than that, we feel rather comfortable. You may know and remember that our prime. goal was to be among the best three in the world, and we are still there.. The group numbers in more detail on the next slide. I think there is not too much to be. added. We have the gross premium income. The top line goes down, FX adjusted by 2.1%.. Interestingly enough, if we adjust the net premium earned by the FX, we still – we even. saw a slight increase which indicates that we have increased our net retention.. That is especially true for one of the large life transactions which Uli had already. mentioned, which did not repeat itself. That was retroceded to a very large extent, so we. lost the gross premium. We also lost the retro premiums. This is why the numbers deviate. to quite some extent.. We had repaid a hybrid transactions in mid-2015, so we did benefit from half of that effect. in 2015. We had a full year lower volumes of hybrid. This is why the interest on hybrid goes. down. Accordingly, other income, again, in the positive range, the more positive range. It. is, again, impacted by currency exchange rates positively, a little bit lower than before we. have, and we will come back to that. Saved our LOC costs to quite some extent, so this. also is also is reflected in the other income line. Apart from that, the tax ratio where we. did provide a little bit of cushion last year based on the result of a tax audit, didn't repeat. itself, so we are back to normal. And this also why the EBIT goes down slightly, the net. income goes up, that is based on the tax rate being back to normal.. The P&C side, I think what is worth mentioning here, we do see that the combined ratio. comes in below 94% and in the Q4 standalone, even below 90%, driven by, as we've. mentioned already, some positive run-offs, but also the large losses coming in below. expectations.. To come back to the reserving levels one more time, Uli mentioned that before, as part. of our year-end procedures, we have lots of people coming in and looking at the. reserves. That starts with our auditors. That is our internal actuaries, as well as the prestudy from Towers Watson. Their indication was that the reserving level and the reserve. redundancies have at least stayed where they were.. So, one should assume that if there was a positive run-off, which should have decreased. reserve redundancies, that we have at least added as much to keep the reserving level. where it was. Uli mentioned already, we might most likely not have added as much as we. did last year. You should assume that the reserving level was flat. Apart from that, I think. the result, extraordinarily well. I think it was the best result on the P&C side we've ever. produced, which of course, came – was taken with delight.. If we look at the details, the picture becomes a little bit more mixed. We see – if we look. at the single markets and compare them with the MtCRs, which we have defined. You see. that North America came in well below the MtCR, good results, good volumes as well.. Continental Europe made it, barely.. Marine looks as it was a very, very attractive line of business, which of course it isn't. We. will present the outlook where, at least, Marine is promising okay-ish profitability. It is even. more – so, here, the positive run-off, namely Sandy, Deepwater Horizon, and Costa. Concordia did benefit this line of business remarkably. So, if we could write more business. with 38.5% combined, that would be great, but unfortunately this is not available today.. This is even more true for Aviation. Here, we feel that just by coincidence, the claims are. very low. So, this combined ratio does, by far, not represent the state of the market in. Aviation.. Credit and surety, here, it is a little bit the other way around. You will see on the large loss. list that we had one large loss. So we still see the profitability as being attractive. So there. are also growth expectations and goals in 2016 based on these larger single losses,. again, one of which even made it to the large loss list. We have exceeded the MtCR by. quite some margin.. Cat, the non-proportional cat business, as you can see, came in, again, very positively. But. also here, the under-usage of our large loss budget is reflected. Overall, 93.7%, the. combined ratio down there, well below the MtCR, or at least below the MtCR. So this. demonstrates the profitability of our P&C portfolio remarkably.. Large losses, a brief look. You see that the large loss burden has increased as compared. to last year from €570 million to €630 million. Had we not increased our large loss. expectations or budget, then the €630 million (31:00) had not been too far away from. €690 million. So, in that respect, we had seen some large losses. And I would also like to. remind you, so if we take out the €200 million out of our result, which we had not spend. as large losses, if you tax those, you would come in at particularly €150 million (31:26). So. even with large losses in line with the budget, we would have made €1 billion.. Well, that is the list. I think nothing to comment here. The wildfires in Canada, the. Hurricane Matthew, I think these were the largest and I already mentioned the one credit. claim here on the bottom of the page.. So now to the other business line. You see that the life business has been increasing. I. think Uli has mentioned that before. There were some discontinued larger contracts,. Australia and China. Uli already explained the enhanced annuity business here in the UK,. which came down as well.. We should also always bear in mind that especially the financial solutions business written. in the U.S. doesn't produce that much premium. So premium is not always the best. indicator for the business, nor is the EBIT margin, especially when it comes to the financial. solutions business, you see at the bottom of the page why would you – how can you. make 18% as an EBIT margin when your target is 2%.. Here, if you produce business and margin without producing premium, then the EBIT. margin is not the best indicator. Why do we show it? Yes, I think that goes back to the. times when we had financing business, pre-financing business, where the 2% was an okay. margin requirement. And, again, please bear in mind that, here, the EBIT margin is not the. best indicator for the profitability of the business.. We do mention the negative impacts from the legacy business. We did that before. We. have, I think, done everything to improve the numbers, which also is presented, as I. mentioned, as were the savings of the LoC costs and other income and expense line,. which improves remarkably. Also, some of the deposit accounted margins show up in that. line, so this is not just coincidence.. The other income and expense line on the life & health segment represents business. results as well. Still, the higher mortality burden, which we have experienced in 2015,. where we had good expectation that this might not repeat itself, happened again. We are. still working on it. We do commute business. We increase rates. This is a block in run-off.. But unfortunately, in 2016, we didn't see the improvements which we have expected,. which then leads to the deterioration of the net underwriting results. We should bear in. mind it's not as drastic as it shows here, because also the net underwriting result last year. did show the one-off approximately also €40 million from a commutation of a larger. contract.. Uli mentioned overall the result is fully in line with our expectations, with nearly the €350. million, which defined the upper mark, and I will leave it then to Uli to show you the. outlook for the next year.. One other picture which might look a little bit strange, and I have to admit we are. comparing apples-to-oranges here, so please bear with us, we look at gray MCEV. numbers. The gray is MCEV numbers are even adjusted in 2015, because in 2015, we. already used the capital costs, which would, at that point in time, have been introduced by. Solvency II. And the blue bar represents the pre-tax Solvency II value of new business. number.. Still, even if we would have adjusted for that, we would have looked at a remarkable. increase. So, especially by the end of the year, our colleagues all around the world, but. also especially, again, financial solutions in the U.S. were able to lock in new business,. which should also materialize IFRS profits in 2017.. Already, as they were entered into late in the year, the P&L in 2016 was not affected by. that value of new business. So, we are rather happy and confident that this will materialize. over the future. And you see the target of €220 million for the year and the achievement. which was achieved.. Investments, you see that the ordinary investment income goes down quite remarkably.. It's not – again, not as drastic as it is represented here. Please bear in mind the €39 million. of the life contract where we did get the money back last year was – or had to be. presented as ordinary income. Moreover, we had some extraordinary gains from our. private equity portfolio, also in the ordinary line in 2015. So, yes, it goes down slightly, but. it isn't as drastic. The realized gains go up.. Also here, it is not actually that we were trying to use the valuation reserves to improve. gains. But nearly every turnover in the portfolio is leading still to realize gains. We did not,. for instance, realize any gains in our new listed equity portfolio, where we have in the. impairment line nearly €30 million depreciations or impairments after Brexit. Of course,. right now, you see that our unrealized gains and losses have improved. A good €100. million come from the listed equity portfolio. So, it would have been easy to realize that. gains (38:50) and mitigate the impairments after Brexit, which we didn't do.. Overall, the 3% I think are a little bit more than we were trying to achieve. You see also. the unrealized gains and losses go up. That doesn't look very impressive here. We had. lots of volatility as you might remember over the course of the year, short after – I think. after the Brexit in the aftermath, I think nearly €1 billion of additional valuation reserve has. been created. Then after the Trump election, within one-and-a-half week, €800 million. were gone again. But with the €200 million, again €100 million coming from the listed. equity portfolio, we still have a comfortable buffer also on the asset side.. I think there is no real news from that split, where the ordinary income comes from. So, I. introduced as the barbell strategy, if you look at the numbers. (40:17) the government. bucket goes up, and also the lower corporate goes also up or the investment grade goes. down a little bit, the non-investment grade, I can tell you, goes up, at least behind the dot.. We have also increased the listed equities. As you can see also, the real estate goes up. slightly, fully in line with our investment strategy, but no drastic changes here as well.. So, what I have also brought with me is a little bit more detail about the preliminary Q4. numbers of our Solvency II reporting. It is interesting to learn that German regulator or the. regulators as such did insist on providing us to them preliminary Q4 numbers. We will then. also have to publish the full-year 2016 numbers. There should be no difference. Maybe we. find one or the other mistake we will have to correct, but we do not expect the numbers. to change. The final full year numbers will be published in May.. Uli mentioned the major points, and those who follow us for quite some time do know. that we do provide different metrics here. You see it on the right-hand side, last year's. numbers as a comparison. So the regulatory Solvency II number did increase from 221% to. 230%.. We have our internal measure. You will see the differences in detail on the next slide.. Here, we adjust for the minority haircuts as well as the operational risk model. So. internally, this is the view we see as a real economic view. Our 1-in-200 years measure. would be 262%. The AA minus equivalent number of 1-in-3,333 years equivalent is 130%.. So a comfortable buffer.. I already indicated here, you see the details of the adjustments we do from the regulatory. view to our group internal economic view. The haircut for minority interest represents. €626 million. The add-on for the standard formula risk represents €436 million. Uli. mentioned that we do expect to have a full model in 2018, which then should be. associated with the saving of the €440 million or nearly €440 million than as from last. year. Here, you see the contributors to, on the one hand, the risk capital, on the other. hand, the basic own funds. The drivers here were, to some extent, of course, the. profitability within the year. Also, the currency exchange rates did increase our risk capital. as well as our basic own funds, so I wouldn't go in too much detail.. The market risk, if you compare the numbers, has increased. But also, the diversification. effects have increased with the increase of the standalone risks as well, so we still do feel. very comfortable. I also have brought with me here the reconciliation between the IFRS. numbers. I think we did the exercise more than once. You see the differences, the. adjustments for assets under our management or the health or maturity (44:32) all the. assets, which are not valued at market.. Then, the adjustments for the technical provisions, discounting, redundancy of loss. reserves that is reflected in the increase or the decrease of liabilities here as well. We see. some adjustments. Of course, then, these adjustments have to be taxed the minority. haircut one more time.. Here, I did refer, a few minutes ago, to the unused or unutilized hybrid bucket of nearly. €1.7 billion, which is represented by the shaded green bar here in the middle, which then. leads at the end to the basic own funds according to Solvency II. That again I think the full. Solvency II reporting, as I mentioned, will be ready and audited by May.. I think that concludes my presentation. And as always, as I see, the target matrix popping. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you again, Roland. Okay. Little bit on to target matrix and the outlook. (45:59). exciting here. I mean most targets have been met, notably, the profitability targets. The. growth targets, not. This is due – as explained due to the soft market, as well as a low. interest rate environment, but at least we saw some increase in the net income.. That then brings me right to the outlook, going to the individual lines. North America, I. mean, of course, we already reported quite a bit on our renewal call and so all of that is. still valid. So profitable growth on North America continues into 2017, not based on single. large transactions, but the many treaties that we with our significant more than 600. clients in the U.S.. Continental Europe, a little bit of mixed bag, stable and good profitability in Germany. We. see some increases in France because we managed to improve our market position. there. Eastern Europe, business sanctions in Russia as well as currencies, et cetera, I. mean, are reduced in value even against the euro as it's coming down a bit. Profitability. should be sufficient to cover the cost of capital.. Marine, we continue to believe that we have a profitable book there. Unfortunately, with a. soft market, it will be a smaller profitable book, even though not much smaller. Aviation,. while here we believe that the rates are no longer sufficient to cover the cost of capital,. we already reduced our involvement through the – at 01/01 (47:52). So, it's clearly a soft. market portfolio now that we have like we have prior to 9/11. And we also bought quite a. lot of retro on it just to safeguard. The results, it's, by the way, the line of business where. we have the highest percentage of redundant loss reserves.. Credit and surety, we see some growth. We have further improved our already leading. market position. We are not the market leader, but we are, I think, among the top two.. Results, we should bounce back to earning the cost of capital. We have – in loss-making. treaties, we could improve the – I mean, the terms and conditions for the reinsurers. And,. therefore, we think the business should earn the cost of capital again.. topic to tell you a little bit how we see the Ogden tables. I mean, we write about £50. million UK motor excess of loss. We write very little proportion of the motor business in. whistles on those treaties, we're not seeing much of exposure there.. exposure there. But of course, from the UK motor excess of losses, we only write to. million to £8 million. So, on the single person losses, even with the new Ogden tables,. many of them will not be able to reach us.. If I look at the loss reserving on those £50 million of premium, we have £240 million of. loss reserves, £260 million of those are own loss reserves. And even if you look – I mean,. this is just the last four underwriting years, because we believe that the last four. underwriting years will be the most exposed. If you go back further, then the overall loss. reserves are in excess of £400 million.. Again – of course, if you go back, the IBNR percentage a little bit lower there. It's only half. of the loss reserves. If you go back all the way, are actually higher – actually own reserves.. So, we believe we are very conservatively reserved here. And we also pending a more. detailed analysis of the individual claims which we are currently undertaking, we would. believe that our current loss reserves would probably be sufficient to deal with the new. Ogden tables. I mean, we might still put some additional reserves on, but as I said, we are. engaged in a rather deep dive there into the individual claims.. Due to our high attachment points, we have a pretty good transparency on the claims that. have the potential to hit our layers because at €5 million or average €7.5 million to €8. million, those are serious claims that expose us there and so we know about them.. Facultative, yeah, I mean, we think we will continue to improve the profitability there. It has. been good, but there is room to improve it, but that will be to the detriment of the top. line. The worldwide treaty business, we have readjusted our agricultural business a little. bit in response to terms and conditions. We also reduced our business in China. So we will. On the contrary, the structured reinsurance and ILS, we see tremendous growth. As we, in. detail, explain to you in our – on the occasion of our renewal call, that will be also the. driver for the growth of our P&C business this year.. In the property catastrophe, we are still under-weight. However, if we have losses in line. with what we have seen in the last five years, we would still have good results there. If the. losses reach the expected levels, then of course we will struggle to earn the cost of. capital. That's the reason why we are under-weight and that's the reason why we bought. more at recession on the catastrophe business.. Life & Health, overall we expect increased profitability which will largely come from our. financial solutions business. This is business which is IFRS EBIT accretive quite rapidly. The. good thing is that the average duration of the treaties whilst shorter than the traditional. risk treaties, particularly on the life side, is still around 10 years I would say and therefore,. the treaties that we already have on board will continue to provide profitability in future.. We managed to write some new business, actually, quite attractive new business as you. have seen in the value of new business. We also managed to renew our most profitable. treaty up to now in the U.S. which we did not expect, but we managed to come up with a. deal that is still accretive for our client and so will continue to produce profits for us.. On the risk solutions side, we see a more stable situation. We expect to earn the cost of. capital. We still expect through the negative impacts from the U.S. mortality business here,. but that should be outweighed by the new business that we write across the world.. Morbidity, improved situation here. We have new business opportunities which should. increase the profitability there. And longevity, I mean, it's largely what we write these days. as pension blocks. Pension block business, the way we account it, if things go according to. the actuaries' plan, the margin should increase quite significantly after 7 to 10 years.. Unfortunately, we have very few treaties. I think it's only one of the pension blocks that is. already more than seven years old. So, I mean, this will be – hover around the 2% to 2.5%. mark, as far as EBIT margin is concerned.. Bringing that all together, the guidance, we increased on the occasion of our renewal call.. We now expect growth of our business again, low-single digit, maybe 3%, 3% to 5%,. something like that, driven by the P&C business, whilst the life business would be more. flattish. Return on investment, 2.7%, provided that the capital markets behave and we see. no turmoil that we had seen in 2008. Group net income, more than €1 billion. We are. pretty confident that we will be able to reach that even if the large losses only stay within. the budget. So if we have €825 million of large losses, we still should be more than €1. billion, mainly driven also by the increased profitability that we expect from Life & Health.. And the dividend policy will be entirely unchanged if all those numbers transpire as. guided. Of course, that means that the large losses stay in the budget, no turmoil in the. capital markets, then we most likely will pay again extraordinary dividend. And then so – I. mean, the line should continue as we have seen in the last three years. Then the rationale. of the medium-term business development for Hannover Re. There's our conservative –. continued conservative loss reserves, strong market position, and better terms and. conditions on our retro sessions (57:53). We feel that we should be able to keep the. combined ratio below 96%, hence the overall underwriting result should be rather stable.. We still expect that the market will change, and the results of the – the average result of. the reinsurers are deteriorating. And like in 2012 and 2009, we expect that we will be able. to grow our market share there. Life & Health, we saw that from 2019 onwards, we would. – up until 2019; we would be within the range of €300 million to €350 million EBIT. We now. are confident that already in 2017; we will be above the €350 million upper threshold of. this €300 million to €350 million. So, the threshold should be more for 2017 between. €350 million and €400 million. This is based, of course, on the new business that we have. written and on the quite attractive pipeline through the new transactions.. Net investment income, we expect rather stable. We expect continued increase in our. funds under own management, and we also are quite pleased to see the increased. interest rates in the U.S. because almost half of our assets under own management are. U.S. dollars. So that will help with the, I mean, reinvestment yield which should aid us with. keeping the investment income rather stable.. That concludes our remarks, Roland's and mine. And we look forward to your questions.. Thank you very much.. Q&A. (01:00:05) thank you. We will now begin our Q&A session. Just as a reminder, please wait. for the microphone so that everybody can hear your question, especially the colleagues. We shall proceed first with the questions from the attendees in the room and then move. on to the questions coming from the conference call. The first question I've already. spotted by Vinit, and we continue with Kamran and then go to left side.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you. This is Vinit from Mediobanca. Just on the reserving – just taking up on your. comment that reserves are – confidence level is similar to last year. Just from looking at. the full-year to full-year combined ratio, then adjusting for the budget, seeing where the. reserve releases is, it looks like it's probably that the conservatism is only increasing, I. would reckon, whereas you maintain that it is at par because we heard (01:01:42) for a few. years that the auditors do not like this phenomena. So first of all, is this understanding. correct? Secondly, is the auditors okay if it is correct? Because, obviously, this builds up the. buffer a little bit.. And then second, very quick check on the growth in credit. Uli, you mentioned that the. treaties should improve and there was one large loss. But if we track the credit surety. segment's combined ratio through the quarters, the whole of 2016, each quarter was. north of 100%. Is it – is the optimism based on the fact that it's a short-tail book and you're. going to re-price quickly? Or if you could just comment on that. Thank you, please.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if you look at the credit, that's clearly short-tail. But that has not been the driver of. the higher combined ratios, maybe with the exception of one treaty of China. The driver. has been more from the surety side and they are largely, I would say, from Latin America. and Spain where we have seen increased claims.. As far as the Asian situation is concerned, I think that's solved. We expect to see. combined ratios below 100 there now. On the surety, it's a little bit more volatile, I would. say. The only thing is we tend – I mean, there's tendency to reserve relatively highly at the. beginning, and then often we can see recoveries at a later stage. I mean, for example,. the large Spanish loss, the – I mean, the project – that was the project that was stopped. as a result of that bankruptcy meanwhile have continued to be contracted (01:03:50). again.. So we expect some recoveries there, but that will take time. I mean, these things are not. coming within a year. That's the reason why we expect combined ratios on the credit. business – credit and surety business at around, I would say, 95% for the current year.. The reserving question, I would hand to Roland.. Roland Vogel. Yeah. I'm not exactly sure, Vinit, what drove you to assume that we are even more. conservative. As mentioned before, I think we have not added to the reserve. redundancies remarkably this year. This already is a remarkable difference if we compare. it to last year where we added more than €300 million. When it comes to the auditors, I. can tell you that the overall reserve volume has increased more than €1 billion, even. currency adjusted. So, in that regard, the confidence range they apply I think is the 40% as. well as the 80 percentile has increased together with the volumes, and their. considerations of what is in the range and what is not in the range. So, the red card we. have received last year was a yellow card this year because the range has increased a. little bit more than that. So, in that regard, we're still at the upper range, but there is still. also flexibility to some extent.. Ulrich Wallin. And I think – if I may add, I think it's still fair to say that we would have to expect an upward. year the rate reductions or the rating quality did not deteriorate that much, but it did. deteriorate overall. I mean, we're in the fifth year of the soft market, and therefore, we. always expect that that the underlying combined ratios would increase. That's also the. reason why we felt so comfortable to have sales (01:06:41) buffers because we – I mean,. we did not expect actually at the outset of 2015 that we would increase the confidence. level again. That just happened for two reasons in 2015; one, the underlying claims were. particularly low; and secondly, due to a continued low inflation, the advised and paid. claims that were emerging in 2015 were below the calculation – the actual calculation that. was performed based on the end of the 2014 numbers.. I would say, if you look at the emergence of the claims that we had seen, paid was not. (01:07:43) actually down, but the advised loss reserves from our clients, they were much. more in line, which was expected by the actuaries when they computed their calculations. at the end of 2015. And that, of course, also has an effect. And therefore, if you have a. redundancy in the loss reserve, it's difficult to look at that like money, like a fixed asset. that you can look at like money, because it's just the result of an actuarial calculation.. What is a little bit assuring is that despite the fact that the premium did not increase the. overall volume of the loss reserves also increased and also the volume of what we call the. segment reserves, which is the – our own IBNR reserves, which we are setting out in. accordance with IFRS principles, this segment reserve also increased in the current year.. Therefore, the main reason for that the redundant loss reserves did not increase was. really the emergence of the advised and paid losses in 2016.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions. The first one, on the dividend. I guess,. you showed steady growth in that this year to five-year as total. Next year, the way I. understand is you got to step-up in German GAAP earnings next year. Is next year the. greatest opportunity to have a step-up in the dividend payout ratios? That's the first. question. Any kind of thoughts on that?. And the second question, just coming back to Ogden. We've seen some headlines in the. trade press in the last few days, say, suggesting price rises for non-proportional motor. reinsurance might be in the range of 50%. By the sounds of the impact on Hannover Re,. no impact at all. So maybe could you give a bit of an outlook on what we should expect. for motor reinsurance prices for the rest of this year? Thanks. And also as well, if you have. any material renewals.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if you look at our reserving on the motor business, I mean, we are reserving. combined ratios of around 135% on UK motor excess of loss. If that would actually be the. final outcome, which, of course, the underwriting and pricing actuaries are not believing,. then we shouldn't write that business at all. So like – I mean, if you look at our underwriting. years like between 2002 and, I would say, 2010, I mean, there we have combined ratios. which are more mature, more in the region of 80%. And, of course, if you talk to. underwriters, they would expect that the 135% that we are currently booking, I mean, that. would – they think that would come down to similar levels, particular as we have seen rate. increases in the current years due to the PPOs.. And, I mean, we probably have higher motor excess of loss rates than most of the. markets because we only wrote full coverage, including full cover for PPOs, whilst many. markets would only write the capitalization of the PPOs, which is different terms and. conditions. And the pricing differential between the two products is about 30%. So, we. are already getting higher rates on our motor excess of loss.. The fortunate thing is that the emergence of the PPOs have been more benign than we. have actually thought, so we have a little bit of a buffer there. But nonetheless, I mean, if. the annual claims costs are increasing by 10% for the UK motor business, which I think. some early – some early analysis of Willis Towers Watson that was published shows, of. course, that will be – I mean, non-proportional be weighted on the excess of loss. business, particular for those carriers that buy very low down. Almost all the development. will then be in the excess of loss. So if the price deficiency due to the Ogden rates on UK. motor is 10%, I think a 50% increase on the motor excess of loss is – I mean, it's a very. good guess, I would say. I mean, at this point in time, we're analyzing the numbers really in. order to come at this pricing. I would say that the majority of our UK motor excess of loss. business renews at 01/01 (01:13:17). Those that renew at 01/04 (01:13:19) is a particular. difficult one to tackle, but together with our clients, we will. But I mean, I think we will –. there will be significant rate increases on UK motor.. It's also because of the uncertainty. I mean, until we've really looked at the individual. claims, which we are currently doing, there's uncertainty on the impact, and if an. underwriter is uncertain and the market for UK motor excess of loss is not that large. because of the unlimited nature that many reinsurers that wouldn't even write that. business, therefore, I mean, I think we will be able to sell significant higher prices there.. Roland Vogel. And maybe I can comment on the indications about the German GAAP results and their. impact on – or potential impact on any dividend policy. I think we've explained the dividend. policy more than once, it never did actually depend on German GAAP numbers. We don't. see that much dependence on U.S. GAAP numbers. We would look at that really from an. economic or IFRS point of view.. Our German GAAP result in 2015 was more than €900 million. At that point in time, there. were some indications that our German GAAP balance sheet seems to be a bit weak. We. never confirmed that we never saw it like that. We used the increase of the valuation of. one of our subsidiaries. By the way, if there was a tax-free measure to increase the. German GAAP result, we add it to retained earnings. So we felt that this demonstrates. that we have lots of measures to also make the German GAAP balance sheet a little bit. stronger.. Then, as we all know and we have explained before, we are looking forward to a crucial. impact on the equalization reserve and the 2001 year disappearing out of that equation.. We have already applied some measures in 2016. So again, the German GAAP result in. 2016 was extraordinary high. It was €950 million (01:15:49). Also, here – so we will use that. amount to pay out a little bit more than €600 million, so we will have the chance to add. to, well, either to retained earnings or the profits carried forward which gives us a. dividend buffer and adds to continuity in the dividend payments.. We look forward to, again, another very good German GAAP results based on the. equalization reserve releases coming through this year again. But also here, I would not. say that this has a direct or crucial, immediate impact on our ability or our strategy to pay. dividends, if that is.... Ulrich Wallin. I mean, I think we look at two things here. One is, of course, the dividend for the current. year, but also the – I mean, consistency of the dividend. And, of course, I mean, if you go. back to the beginning of the century, due to a much lower capital base that we had then,. we were not be able to pay a consistent dividend.. I mean, if you look at 2001 with the World Trade Center incident, 2005 with the. hurricanes, and 2008 with the financial crisis, we were not able to pay dividends in those. years because we needed all those funds and that capital in order to defend our rating. and at the same time be able to benefit from the market opportunities that were. following those events. We feel that we have moved on from that situation and are in a. stronger position now. So we would say on the reoccurrence of the situation like we had in. 2001 or 2005 or even 2008, we should still be able to pay a dividend at least to the tune. of the ordinary dividend. So we look at both sides.. Of course, I mean the German GAAP earnings have been quite favorable, I mean two. years in a row now and we expect this continue into 2017, which means that, I mean we. have increased, retained earnings and have significantly increased profit carryforward. So,. I mean, of course, there is room for increases in the dividend clearly.. Karl Steinle. Okay. We continue on the left-hand side with Andrew Ritchie.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi. It's Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Just to clarify on reserves again, I'm afraid.. Presumably then the assumption is, when you were surprised that you've increased the. redundancy in 2015, I presume you're surprised that you kept the redundancy stable in. 2016, because I'm assuming that you are expecting the redundancy to fall over the next. couple of years if you really want to keep the combined ratio flat. Is that still the correct. assumption? That's what you said in the past.. Ulrich Wallin. It's absolutely true. The reason why that didn't happen in 2016, again, is that we didn't. have things that went wrong. I mean, normally, you always expect something goes wrong.. For example, in 2014, we had strengthened our reserve on some Argentinean liability. claims to quite some extent, because the Argentinean cost did not reflect in their. judgment, the terms and conditions of the policy, because they were a little bit unhappy, if. they would have done that that there would be no claims.. And those things happen. I mean, we have to – in the old days forming the (1:19:57). Hannover, we had some reserves strengthening on some HMGA (1:20:02) business. But in. the last couple of years, nothing like that was occurring and that, of course, helped. If our. regular to be expected level of mishaps would have happened, then the redundant levels. would have decreased clearly.. Of course, we try not to make too many mistakes, which we know from the last soft. market at the end of the 1990s, is the largest source of bad results. We are not always. successful with that, but the last two years were pretty good. But – I mean, of course, we. are not expecting to add to the redundancies in 2017. That's very clear. We are in the fifth. year of the soft market. We think that we can keep the combined ratio to have a stable. underwriting profit. But due to the environment around us and the rating environment,. based on the full utilization on the budget, that would then presumably mean that the. redundancies would reduce slightly.. Andrew J. Ritchie. That's helpful. Thanks. Just two other quick questions. The retro you mentioned in the. outlook, in practical terms, how does the – how do the changes in retro help 2017? It's not. helping the large loss budget, which is flat. So maybe just, Roland, if you could just clarify. how that is?. And the final question, it seems the financial solutions business you wrote is coming. through or expected to come through to IFRS quicker than we have been accustomed to.. Is that the case or is this just kind of coming through from previous years? Why is it coming. – especially to come through (1:22:08) to IFRS income so quickly? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, firstly on the retro. We bought an aggregate excess of loss cover to cover our large. loss budget for property catastrophe losses. We did not use that to reduce the large loss. budget, which in theory we could have done. That's the reason there we are better. covered. And so, I mean, we could – I mean, in 2017, we could better absorb than in. previous years natural catastrophe losses that go over and above the large loss budget.. On the.... Andrew J. Ritchie. Large loss budget is more secure than another years, essentially, that's what you mean?. Ulrich Wallin. That's right. That's right. Then the – why are we thinking? I mean, normally, the financial. solutions treaties are much more accretive and go much more quickly into IFRS earnings,. because, I mean, if you look at a traditional mortality solutions cover, if you write new. business, you write policies with durations on average, say, 25, 30 years, and of course. also most of these treaties have rates that are increasing throughout the duration of the. underlying policies, because, of course, the risk increases with age of the insurers. That. means that the profitability is clearly back-loaded.. In the financial solutions treaties, that's not the case, because, here, I mean, for a large. extent, we finance redundant (1:24:03) loss reserves or other cash flows. Those are more. imminent. Most of the financing, non-cash financing treaties are actually pretty shortdated. I mean, many of them are only three to five years.. The treaties that finance redundant (1:24:27) reserves, they normally have durations of 20. years, but they have – there are certain breakpoints. I mean they can be cancelled on a. certain circumstances by the seeding companies. Therefore, it would not be terribly clever. to backload the profitability. So on those treaties, the profitability is much more. frontloaded and that is why they are accretive to IFRS earnings more rapidly.. Roland Vogel. Well, if I may add, plus, you would not look at new business values for such a long time if. there is a breakpoint, if there is a recapture rate, you would only calculate the value of. new business up until that date, which is a shorter duration than other longer term. contracts.. Karl Steinle. Okay. We will continue to the left-hand side with Xin Mei and then I've seen another. question on the right-hand side from Johnny.. Ulrich Wallin. I think there's another one on the left side, over there.. Karl Steinle. I'm sorry.. Xin Mei Wang. Hi. Xin Mei Wang from Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to ask about the life and health. outlook. So you're very confident on next year's results given the financial solutions. I was. just wondering given the volatility we've seen in 4Q in the mortality business, so what. makes you confident in reaching that number next year or does that €350 million to €400. million sort of bake in some conservatism for continued volatility or are you very confident. that those issues are dealt with or can be dealt with now and you're going to see that. again?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I think if you look at the volatility on the mortality solutions business, that is pretty. high on a quarterly basis. It's less on an annual basis. I mean we tend to have quarters that. are very good, and then we tend to have quarters that are not so good.. I mean the expectation of increased profitability, we already, I mean took into account. some further losses from the mortality solutions business in the U.S. But, I mean, that is. out rated by the financial solutions business. We also have attractive new business in our. Bermuda company, also in China, we were able to improve and write significant new. business, that's risk business, on the back of our joint venture that we have regarding the. mortality business. That was actually quite good.. There might be more of that in other Asian countries, so things are developing there and. that's why we are quite bullish on our life and health's profitability, despite the fact that. from that old underwriting years in the U.S., we are expecting further losses.. Xin Mei Wang. Thank you.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Then, we continue with Jonny Urwin.. Jonny Urwin. Thank you. Jonny Urwin from UBS. Just one question for me. Can you give us some color. on how you're seeing claims inflation trends develop globally, I guess, in the U.S. in. particular? And where are we versus the sort of levels you're baking in through reserves. (1:28:01)? I guess is we're still pretty far away. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. I mean, the actual inflation trends that we are currently seeing are still quite low, I. would say. I mean, if you compare it, say, to 5 to 10 years ago, we are clearly lower. There. is, of course, I mean, a clear exposure that inflation might pick up, because I think the. unemployment rate in the U.S. is quite low. I mean, one could probably talk of full. employment. And also, the economy is going reasonably (1:28:43). We probably have to. expect some further budget deficit that might increase, and that might in the end lead to. some high inflation. We still have some inflation protection in place through inflation. linkers, but that of course, could also be a source of reducing the redundancies and the. loss reserves.. Of course, I mean, if you have higher claims due to inflation picking back up, it's certainly. better to come from conservative loss reserves than from strict best estimate loss. reserves.. Jonny Urwin. Thank you.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Another question is coming from Paris, and then we'll continue with Will Hawkins.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes. Thank you. Paris from Credit Suisse. Very quick question from me. Given the. developments you are seeing in the capital markets, can you give us an idea of how your. reinvestment rate has changed?. Roland Vogel. Yes, it's an interesting question. I just prepared a presentation for next week where we. had a brief look at reinvestment rates. You know that we had presented more than once. the approximately 15 basis points we lose, which are then explained between the market. yields and the portfolio yields. We went down from 2.9% to 2.7%, which might indicate that. this is even accelerating.. Interestingly enough, the opposite is true. We went down with our projections in 2017",20170309_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2017-3-9_FS000000002335217180.pdf,2017-03-09
15,"Well, good afternoon to everybody here in London, and good afternoon depending on. your time of day to all those who are joining us via the Internet. I wasn't going to give you. a reminder about turning off the mobile phones, but it's easy to forget. So please do. check if they are off.. That said, welcome to Hannover Re's Analyst Conference. It's a pleasure to see that so. many of you have taken up the invitation. And we are very delighted to present to you the. numbers for the financial year 2014 in greater details, the numbers which we have. published already this morning.. Today, we have a new feature compared to previous Analyst conferences. We are. offering additional dial-in option for all those who were not able to participate here. physically here at the London Stock Exchange. As a reminder, the dialed-in participants will. be in listen-only mode.. First of all, Ulrich Wallin will kick things off with a brief overview of the 2014 financial year.. Roland Vogel, our CFO will then move on to present the financials in detail. Afterwards,. we will be happy to respond at lengths to all of your questions you might have. And I. would like to point out that you are kindly asked to wait for the microphone, so that. everybody can understand your question even those who are not in the room.. On that note, I am delighted to hand over to Ulrich Wallin.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, good afternoon, and welcome to our presentation of our 2014 results. I will kick it off.. I will also finish it off as the outlook for the coming year.. Well 2014 for us was quite a good year, I would say. As you can see, we managed to. increase the after-tax earnings of the group by more than 10%, and as this has been. driven by strong underlying earnings from all segments, so that we could continue with. our rather conservative policy when it comes to the reserves, be it on the P&C side or be. it on the Life & Health side. So from that point of view, we didn't need to be aggressive. on any of the various items of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet in order. to generate this increased profitability.. We also decided to increase the dividend by a special dividend of €1.25 together with the. ordinary dividend of €3 to €4.25. This is due to the fact that our capital grew rather. remarkably by 28.2% and that of course would mean that the excess capital also has. increased. And of course, the ROE for the current year would be under a little bit more. stress so that it was the right time to start with the capital management for Hannover Re,. which we already announced at our last Investor Day.. You can see that the business continues to grow even though at lower pace, due to the. rather challenging market on the P&C side where, as well publicized, the competition has. increased quite significantly, but nonetheless, the business continues the growth both the. P&C business as well as the Life & Health business.. As already mentioned, the bottom line drew more pronounced as compared to the top. line, with almost 20% growth of the EBIT compared to last year and, as already. mentioned, 10.1% of the after-tax earnings. Despite the significant growth of the capital,. the ROE is still at a quite acceptable level with 14.7%. So we continue to enjoy attractive. ROEs.. If you then look at the individual business groups, overall with the property casualty. business, we are happy we think development has been positive. EBIT grew by 12.2%.. Admittedly, one might say that the combined ratio, particularly in the fourth quarter, some. of you might have expected a slightly lower combined ratio.. On the other hand, we are quite happy with the after tax result of the P&C business. group, and we were also quite pleased that we could keep with our conservative loss. reserving policy, which is the result of course of the quality of the underlying business. But. also – and that shouldn't be forgotten of the fact that the large losses came in well within. budget. And this of course means there was no pressure or alleviation of pressure to the. combined ratio from the large loss side, which really pretty much offset the pressure that. the combined ratio of course have from the reduced rates, which we see as the result of. the current soft market. So therefore, we could keep the loss reserving policy rather. unchanged, a little bit better than we actually had expected.. With the Life & Health business, I'm quite pleased that the earnings have actually. increased. The EBITDA increased by 75%, and also we had a 25% increase of the post tax. earnings. This is in line, which what we are trying to tell you since quite some while;. certainly since the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2013. This year this was still an easy. target to have because our 2013 numbers, of course, were depressed due to the. additional reserves that we put on the DII business, which we luckily can say now seemed. to be a conservative.. So what really happened in 2014 that the results normalized. They're not terribly exciting,. but they are more to the normal level that we expect from our Life & Health business. I. would say the technical result particular in the fourth quarter, little bit below what we're. expecting. Again, partly conservative reserving on the enhanced annuities, partly negative. deviation of the actual-to-expected on the ING portfolio.. So – but overall pretty much in line with expectation for 2014 as a whole year. But. everything has a positive as well. If you look forward to 2015, we feel that there is room. for further improvement of the results of Life & Health.. We are very happy altogether with the investment results. Ordinary income up, which is. quite remarkable considering the rather low interest rates environment that we are. wrestling with. Here again the increase in volume helped significantly. Also, it turned out to. be quite favorable for us that we changed the functional currency of Bermuda subsidiaries. at the end of 2013 from euros to U.S. dollar because in restructuring the portfolio of. around €1.4 billion at the time into U.S. dollars, of course, that we had meant that we have. to sell euro securities, which resulted in realized gains.. And at the same time, the new investment in U.S. dollars were done at a time when the. interest rates in U.S. dollars had a little spike, so even on those investments we already. have realized gains. And also the running yield in U.S. dollars is slightly higher than in euros,. particular since recently the EZB started some new experiments with the euro currency. So. overall, we were very pleased with our investment income.. This is a broad overview of what we see for 2014. The finer details, Roland will explain to. you in great detail. Thank you very much.. Roland Vogel. Yes, thank you, Uli. The good thing is that I have an interface to my surrounding again, so. my reading glasses broke 15 minutes before this meeting, but Axel was kind of enough to. get this quality UK product from the drugstore next corner, so I'm online again. Thank you.. Thank you, Uli. I think you mentioned already some parts of – or the major parts of our key. figures and results. But I think we should start with – before we get into the detailed P&L,. we should look at some key metrics or remarkable developments of key metrics which. were not only driven by us, but also by the markets or the EZB or whomsoever.. First of all, the strong cash flow for 2014 nearly reached the €2 billion mark again. We. started a little bit slow into the year. I think we mentioned at previous occasions there was. one U.S. mobility contract, and we might come to that contract again a little bit later, which. was cash negative in the first two quarters. This will turnaround – has already and it will. turnaround in 2015, so we will get that money back. But the second half year with very. strong cash flow, which I think supports the positive message and the quality of the. results, even with a little bit of a more depressed overall growth, the cash flow stays very. positive.. On the right hand side, the assets under own management up by 14% or €4.5 billion. I can. tell you with the development of the U.S. dollar and the yields, especially the yields of the. government bonds, this today is approaching €39 billion. So the increase is really. remarkable. And again, this is not only driven by a very good result, but also the yields and. especially the currency exchange rates.. The same goes for the capital position on the next slide. Equity increased by nearly €1.7. billion or 28%; the policyholder surplus by €1.5 billion. Why is that a little bit different?. Because we paid back €750 million in February, and we issued the subordinated bond,. and we issued a new-subordinated bond in September with another €500 million, which. then again was the reason why the policyholder surplus decreased or their subordinated. bonds here decreased a little bit.. You might remember there is another call date coming up in June for €500 million. Up to. now, we indicated that the last €500 million was already in early refinancing. This is not an. announcement that we will call that. But up to now, we have called every subordinated. bond at its first call date, so one might expect that this green part of the bar might go. down in June.. On the other side of that slide, you see the increase in the shareholders equity. And I think. that demonstrates very clearly where this increase – this strong increase is coming from.. First of all, of course, €986 million of result, the dividend we paid last year was the €362. million. And that demonstrates that the increase coming from the valuation reserves on. our invested assets, as well as the currency exchanges rates this is more than a billion. euros, and is even higher than what we had produced as profits.. Now, you might want to distinguish these two components for the increase or the. increased assets from the currency exchange rates. I think, this is also reflected on the. earnings side by higher U.S. dollar, Aussie dollar, whatever earnings. So we earned also. higher euro values on these amounts. When you look at the valuation reserves, the more. than €630 million in the middle, that is an increase which is really an increase in our capital. base, which also will have an impact on the future ROIs.. The overall number of OCI or capital driven by the valuation reserves in our asset. portfolio is €1.2 billion nearly. And with a modified duration of five years, one could expect,. everything equal, we might lose €120 million per year because this will run off. This will be. capital components, which will disappear in the future, but it's only €120 million per year.. I think this leads us directly into the capital management actions, which Uli had already. mentioned. Here you see a, from my point of view, impressive picture, if you look at the. last six years, six years ago, we came here and mentioned that is our intention to. decrease the volatility in our earnings, to decrease the volatility in our dividend payments.. And if you look at that picture here, you see that we're rather successful, of course. helped by the markets and also the catastrophe components in our business. But even if. in 2011, which was the second highest natural catastrophe burden in the history of. reinsurance, we managed to provide a good dividend.. The €3 plus the bonus do represent €150 million, so that is what we kind of give back to. our shareholders as a start of potential capital management action. The dividend yield. today or a few days ago, 5%. If you go back to the beginning of the year, 6%. If you go. back one year and you had invested into the Hannover Re share one year ago, the. dividend yield would even be above 7%.. One other perspective at the capital development and the ROEs we have provided and. do provide, I think the chart demonstrates clearly the achievement. The average capital. position has been increasing remarkably from the €4 billion to the €6.7 billion this year.. Still, we managed to keep the ROE on a very, very high level.. On the right-hand side, you see the average achievements, on the left-hand side the last. five years. The margins over above the hurdle and we have shown here the old hurdle is. 750 basis points, as well as the new hurdle the 900 basis points has even increased over. the last year's. But we have to bear in mind that this has got to be more challenging in the. future. With the high capital position, and with also the higher volatile capital components,. I have tried to explain to you with the OCI positions, which might be volatile in the future.. So this is going to be more challenging into the future, and this is why we also look at. managing the capital position as well as the income position up there.. I think that then leads us directly into the peer comparison, which we always do. I think we. are still the number one on the four-year horizon. This year two Bermudian companies are. in front of us, so I think that is not very surprising because of the very low cap burden. which the industry has been seeing. So in that regard, we are still happy, and we are still. committed to stay one of the most profitable reinsurers in the industry, also in the future.. So let's then have a brief look at the P&L in more detail. On the group level, I think it's not. necessary to repeat the growth in the turnover of the premium. The first component I. think which needs some explanation is the other income and expense line here. We have. been long in the U.S. dollar and other non-euro currencies already over the course of the. year. And in so far, the majority of that swing from minus €100 million to plus €18 million in. the other expense line is based on the currency result. That should be zero, if I manage. my portfolio on a very highly matched basis. So on the one hand, this is a little bit of one. off.. On the other hand, I think where we were in doubt, we stayed little bit longer in the. foreign currencies as we saw the euro weakening, especially against the U.S. dollar. This is. why this line has improved so remarkably.. Moreover, I think the other components here is the fee income on those contracts on the. Life side, which are deposit accounted, where the risk component is so low that there is. no reinsurance treatment justified and the fee income is reflected in that line and that has. been increasing as well. Moreover, we have been rather successful in managing our LOC. costs down. Also, that is mainly on the Life side, where it was possible to decrease the. costs of the LOCs, which we, in the majority, need to backup our U.S. business.. The tax rate is back to normal. You might remember that last year we had a special effect. on the non-Life, on the P&C side, where the deferred taxes on equalization reserves. could be calculated a little bit more realistically based on a decision for the German tax. man that had produced a €90 million extraordinary effect. That, of course, was not. repeated this year. We are still a little bit on the low side based on a very positive result in. Bermuda where the tax rate is zero and where our cat business is written mainly, so the. contribution from the low tax environments had been a little bit over proportional; same. goes for the Life business, which we write in Bermuda. So this is why the overall tax rate is. a little bit lower than what we would expect for a normalized tax ratio, which should be. around 25% on a group level.. A brief look at the P&C side. We see a slight growth. The 1.2% on a currency adjusted. basis, which is nice and which follows our guidance. Would this number have been. negative that would not have been a problem at all. It is positively influenced by some low. risk, low margin Chinese surplus relief contracts which we sometimes write, sometimes. the margins are not sufficient. So again, it's nice to see it growing. But if that would have. been a negative number, we would not be concerned at all.. The burden or the net retention has increased slightly, so we pay a little bit less for our. repossessions, which makes itself felt here that the net premium income is growing a little. bit more than the gross.. Major losses. I think Uli has already mentioned the large loss budget was €670 million;. €244 million of that budget was unused. And in that regard, it was the third very large –. low large loss number in a row, which of course also as its impact on the competition on. the market. Perhaps – and also that was mentioned by Uli.. Let's discuss a little bit our reserving policy. If you look at the annual result and the run-off. triangles, you will see a positive run-off of €270 million. I think that is really fully in line with. what I was trying to explain at the occasion of the Investors Day, an approximately €50. million positive run-off would be expected per quarter, a little bit more than that for the. year.. So there are no extraordinary unusual effects of run-off result. I would refer to my. presentation at the same place a few months ago where I was trying to explain the. impacts which could be there on the confidence level as well as the run-off result, nothing. extraordinary here. In that regards, the combined ratio for the fourth quarter were – when. we read your first comments, seems to be a little bit disappointing.. As Uli already mentioned, stuck to our reserving policy. We have most likely added and. we're waiting on the final results of the reserve studies. But we will most likely have edit to. the reserve redundancies, which our COO always presents to you at the occasion of the. Investors Day. We have to bear in mind that also the volume of the reserves has increased. based on the currency exchange rate. So percentage-wise, we might have keep or kept. the overall confidence level flat. But in absolute terms, we will have increased within the. reserves numbers, which you might remember was €1.5 billion based on the last study.. And that then also explains a little bit why the fourth quarter effect, which you had. expected in the combined ratio has not taken place to such an extent.. I think that's it. Let's look at the MtCR and the achievements of the year per market on the. P&C side. The margins are getting a little bit narrower. Still, even if you back out the very. positive cat result, we would still have made it and the overall result of the business would. have been still profitable. We shouldn't fool ourselves, a combined ratio of 39.3% is. nothing which we could really see also in the future. And it's so far a large cat year might. make the overall P&C result getting nearer to the breakeven point and it's good to have. buffers, if that happens.. Apart from that, again, we can briefly look at the North America business, still profitable,. below the hurdle – or over and above the hurdle. The Continental Europe positive with. Germany also better than it used to be. The marine business, after the big losses, Sandy,. of course, the Concordia. Very profitable aviation, we know what happened there, the. Tripoli airport as well as the Malaysian airline disasters, of course, hit that. Credit, surety. profitable. UK, London market and direct, we still had a little bit of problem on some. casualty accounts where we were looked at conservatively. We expect that to be far. better in the future. The worldwide treaty on the edge. Cat, of course, I mentioned that. very profitable and, of course, the basis for also the overachievement. Structured. reinsurance very positive and making the margin by far,. The major losses, I mentioned, you can see that here very clearly three years in a row.. And if you add all the under or those amounts for the last three years where we were. under the budgeted loss large numbers, that accounts for €400 million.. So the €426 million which you see here as compared to the €670 million; the €578 million. as compared to €625 million, but if you then go back to the year 2011, you see that all this. what we have saved within over the last three years can be gone within one year. And in. that regard, we should always bear that in mind and not fool ourselves that the very. positive results in this segment might go on forever.. You see the large losses, the single ones, not a real single one was a very major loss. On. the cat side, clearly, below the budget with the storm Ela in Germany, Belgium and in the. Netherlands with the highest large loss burden of around €50 million for our account, the. aviation claims with Tripoli and the Malaysian Airline loses, as I already mentioned. Overall,. as I mentioned, €244 million below our budget. So another friendly pack picture, although. not a glamorous picture.. If we look at the Life & Health reinsurance, we did various longevity deals. We took benefit. from the improved and the hardening rates in Australia and these were the major profit. drivers. We did retrocede some of – especially the longevity deals. This is why the net. retention goes down on the technical side. Uli mentioned that the Australian DII business. did really well, fully in line with our expectations, even slightly better. So that explains the. improvement here. The U.S. mortality still slightly below our expectations, but no bad. surprises here as well. And this is then the basis for the remarkable improvement.. The other income here also is usually better than on the P&C side. It did benefit also from. currency exchange rates. But here even also from the fee income of our deposited. accounting, especially the financial reinsurance contracts which have improved as I. mentioned before.. Margin-wise, I think we are rather happy financial solutions, impressive margins, that is the. business we especially write in the U.S., where our colleagues do provide coverage for. the balance sheet or for the local balance sheet especially. And that is improving and. growing nicely. The longevity also over and above the target.. The mortality and morbidity business, as I mentioned, the U.S. mortality business, some of. that business still not fully in line with our expectations. And here we can come back to. that one U.S. house contract, mobility contract, which we no longer write, where we. looked at reserves and increased the reserves or incurred some losses, especially in the. fourth quarter. Again, we no longer write that business, so this will not reoccur.. And this is also the reason as to why we look very positive into the future, even better. news, if we turn the page and have a very, very brief look at the MCEV. That is hot off. press. For the first time, we managed to present the market consistent embedded value. numbers, together with our year-end results. And we have demonstrated – or in our. presentation only the major numbers. You will find the details if you're interested, if you. believe in MCEVs, then you will find the numbers in the appendix and on the website,. especially the very brand new website of Hannover Re, which I think is worth visiting. anyway.. The MCEV has increased by 16% and is now nearly €4.3 billion. I think even more. importantly the value of new business is for three or even four years in a row now have. very high level, over and above our threshold of the target metrics with €448 million,. again, another new record. Again, this is profit which we will earn, also, long-term up until. 20 years, 30 years. Still with more than a billion euros of new business value over the last. three years, we are very confident that also the IFRS result will improve remarkably in next. years to come.. Perhaps not mentioned on this page, but still important is the MCEV or market consistent. embedded value not recognized on the balance sheet. That increased from €1.10 billion to. €1.12 billion, which is also an increase of more than €100 million. And again, if you believe in. MCEV numbers, that is another off-balance sheet value which Hannover Re carries.. So to come to the investment side. The ROE target, from my point of view, as I'm. responsible for that segment, of course, I look at that even a little bit closer. It is a little bit. underrepresented or underestimated when we show it here. It includes the technical. derivatives, which you see as the change in fair value of financial instruments. That is the. ModCo derivatives as well as the inflation swaps. If we back that out, what we do in our. target metrics, so always the positives and the negatives, we end up at 3.3% ROI, which is. a little bit over and above our target.. If I come back very briefly to the impact of our subordinated bond redemption and. reinvestment, so here we do calculate with the assets beginning of the year, assets end. of the year, divide that by two. Of course, the seven months where I didn't have that. money are not included in that, so also that is a little bit of reason why the numbers here. are a little bit underrepresented. The realized gains and losses, again, Uli mentioned that. already, we had some turnover in the portfolio which created these losses. Apart from. that, there were no real surprises, impairments and appreciations driven by regular. depreciations on the real estate portfolio. So again, nothing extraordinary to write-off. And. with nearly $1.1 billion net investment income, we are happy. And again, it is a little bit more. than we had expected.. It is interesting to look at the bottom of that page what happened to our valuation. reserves. I had addressed that already various times. We have now here the on-balance. sheet valuation reserves. Those are the investments we account for at available-for-sale.. The off-balance sheet values that is what we have as hold-to-maturity or what (40:49) or. others which we do account at amortized costs. Altogether, that number has doubled. from €1.1 billion to more than – or nearly $2.3 billion, and we have not taken advantage of. that by realizing more. That is a buffer for potential yield increases in the future.. A brief look and final look – before I ask Uli to present to you then the outlook, at the. asset allocation. That is rather stable. The corporate portfolio has increased to 35%, a. down a little bit here. A competitive investor, especially by the end of last year, was there. with ease at peak. Also, competing to buy these issues, so that has come down a little bit. as also the prices went down remarkably.. The real estate is developing as well as the private equity. So we keep these portions. stable. And we will hear in a second that with the reinvestment yields we do invest today,. are amounts of around 1.7, 1.8. The expectations for the next year is around 3.15 ROI. With. increased assets under our own management, we estimate the return from the – or the. net investment income, again in the range of the previous year.. I think with that I conclude my details and Uli, the floor is yours with the target metrics.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Okay, target metrics. This year, I'm happy to show it to you because it. looks nicer than most years. You can see that we have achieved all group targets,. including the earnings per share target with 10.1% is client reinsuring. Then I maybe. mention the EBIT margin on the P&C side to 17% shows that this business continues to be. rather profitable. And you can also see that the economic targets, which are the ex-Rück. targets, we have achieved comfortably on both of our business groups.. With that, enough about 2014, let's look into 2015. First of all, P&C business, we have. come off a pretty good start into 2015. The 01/01/2015 renewal was a little bit more. favorable than we expected. We could keep the rates pretty well and, in many cases, and. we also manage to slightly increase the volume. I can also say that the business. opportunities for new business are actually quite good, so we have a good deal flow of. new business coming in. I would however say that this is almost exclusively from existing. clients, where we have a good position as a go-to reinsurer.. If I then look at the three segments, target markets, specialty lines and worldwide. reinsurance. On the target markets, we see good growth in North America at a good. margin, particularly in the U.S. where we have more than 600 clients. So writing larger. shares with these clients and being involved in their new reinsurance purchasing, which. they occasionally do, we see good prospects here.. Continental Europe is a little bit of mixed picture. Parts like France and some other. Continental European countries like Spain, for example, rather competitive and, of course,. volume trending downwards due to selective underwriting. On the other hand, if you look. at Germany, for example, still the underlying profitability trend is very positive. And being. one of the larger markets in Germany, we benefit from that, particular when it comes to. the bottom line.. On the specialty lines, all the business at this point in time is very competitive. So for us,. the emphasis is entirely and only on the bottom line. We feel that we have significant. businesses there. We are particular on the non-proportionate side. It still offers us good. opportunity for profit, but discipline is extremely important here.. On the marine side. Rates have come down a bit, but overall there's still profitable. business. And same is true for credit, surety where we achieved the number two position. in the market in 2010. And this of course helps us now that the business have become a. lot more profitable – sorry, a lot more competitive after good profitability in previous. years.. Of course business close to my heart is aviation. Unfortunately, I can't share a lot of good. competitive. On the UK and Ireland business as well as on the facultative business, we. see some growth again after having retrenched on the UK business last year, and we also. see improved profitability there.. Worldwide treaty. Yes. We see reduced premium on the cat side, which is not fully. showing here. However, the exposure is still unchanged or even slightly up, but the rates. are coming down. So again, conservative underwriting is important. On the Worldwide. treaty, we see plenty of opportunities in the emerging markets, particular India. India and. China to be mentioned, but also on the agricultural business, which with what we have. written recently, we can clearly see that we will have further double-digit growth on the. agricultural business.. Also, on the structured insurance and the ILS business we see good growth opportunities,. partly already materialized in the first two-and-a-half months of the year. So all-in-all, we. are relatively cautiously optimistic on our P&C business for the current year, even a little. bit more positive than I would have been standing here say three months ago.. On the Life & Health side. Again, the emphasis is clearly on the profitability, which we. expect that we could further improve. Particular positive is the financial lines business,. where we have already a quite positive trend, and you will see that when we report our. first quarter results. We already have said early on, longevity – while this is – we haven't. got a new transaction so far this year, well, maybe one slightly larger one. But we are. working on few others. Market has become a little bit more competitive because most of. the reinsurers are competing for that business now. So again, we take a rather. conservative stance, looking for the right deals and not for the volume.. On the mortality we have actually seen good profitability also in 2014 and that is also. including the ING portfolio that put the whole thing together. We expect continued rise of. profitability in that market. I think we will be able to further improve, which means not. make it profitable, but make it less negative, our ING book. And of course, the new. business that we produce in the U.S. still shows a positive (50:38) actual-to-expected, so. On the mobility, where we have seen negative results, we believe that we also should. see an improvement in Australia, where on the group business we have very, very. positive on the prospects for our Life & Health business in 2015.. be at stable interest rates, I hasten to add, stable to low-single-digit growth, a little bit like. rates prevail. You will see some more meaningful growth in euro terms on that business.. Return investment 3%, Roland already mentioned that, however, on a higher volume of. investments. And €875 million group net income guidance, we left that unchanged. compared to what we told you when we reported our third quarter numbers of 2014. We. believe that on stable interest rates that's pretty much the underlying profitability that our. business currently shows, projected with a degree of caution and, therefore, we left it. unchanged.. If we look at the dividend guidance, this is really our standard dividend guidance which we. developed many years ago, where we said yes want to pay out a fair amount of our IFRS. profit. But we also want to keep sufficient profits in the company to self-finance our. growth. With the recent development of the capital, of course, we have deviated from. that remarkably in 2014. Of course, if everything stays equal and the excess capital. position remains equal or even slightly increases, the business opportunities stay equal,. meaning that we still have a soft market and a competitive market and there has been no. major turmoil in the financial markets, then of course the situation is exactly what we have. seen for 2014. And it is probably fair to assume that we will act similarly than we have. done in 2014.. But that of course is only if the situation in 12-months time looks similar to what it currently. looks. And we haven't got a crystal ball and a lot can happen between now and year-end.. With that I would conclude the presentation. I almost forgot the most important slide of. the entire presentation. But of course, by switching the slides that Karl reminded me. for our profit guidance and the prospects for 2015, first, we believe, as I explained, further. improvement and increase of the bottom line of our Life & Health business. Secondly,. despite the soft market and the structural soft market from a supply and demand point of. view, on the P&C side, we believe that we can keep our underwriting profit pretty stable.. That also goes for the combined ratio, provided that the large losses stay within the. budget.. A reason we feel that the quality of the business that we have remains good. Secondly,. the buffers on the sufficiency level of the loss reserves remain intact or even slightly. better than 12 months ago. And the retrocessional program has seen more favorable. terms than 12 months ago. And that, if you put it all together, should result into a. continued favorable underwriting results from our P&C side.. I would, however, say that on the retrocessions, I say terms have improved. That does not. mean that we seek negative margins. If we have the expected loss level, we still see. demands (56:01) into our retrocession mass (56:04).. Then on the investment side, in absolute terms, we feel that the earnings from asset. under management should be quite stable and derivative terms, of course, coming down.. And then we will keep our competitive advantage due to our low admin expense ratio,. which we work hard that we'll continue to see that.. With that however, that concludes our presentations, and we are more than happy to. answer your questions.. Unverified Participant. Well, thank you very much. We will now begin with our question-and-answer session. As a. reminder, please wait for the microphone so that everybody can hear your question,. especially those participating via the conference call. We will proceed to take the. questions from the participants here in the room first and then switch to the questions. coming from the conference call. I already see some hands up and we start with the righthand side with Ben.. Q&A. Ben Cohen. Thanks very much. Ben Cohen at Canaccord Genuity. Two questions please, firstly, in. terms of the special dividend that you're paying, could you just say a bit more as to how. you arrived at the size of that special? It seems to me that you actually could have done. more to help support the ROE if you still have that 13% target into 2015.. My second question, you share price is up, I think, 50% since we last saw you here in. October or whenever it was. In terms of that re-rating is there anything strategically that. you think that gives you more firepower to do? Would you feel that there could be some. benefits to use that multiple maybe in terms of M&A or anything else strategically? That'd. be helpful. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, thank you very much Ben for those questions. I should press the button, yeah. Okay.. But I am mic'd on anyhow, so I think it's not so much of the problem.. On the dividend, the €4.25 was really driven by our German GAAP earnings, which we of. course steered towards that level. We felt that this is a good dividend. It's about 50%, a. little bit more than 50% of our IFRS earnings. And we saw that that would reflect the. underlying strengthening of the capital relatively well. Could we have done more? Sure. you always can do more. However, we felt that that was a good level. Of course, I mean. that would still make it rather challenging to keep the ROE at the level you mentioned for. 2015. But we have to see what else we can do there.. On the share price using it for M&A, while it's of course quite tempting I would say. because the value is pretty good, it's a bit difficult to do that with our anchor shareholder. Talanx with 50.2%, on the basis that they strategically want to keep the majority in. Hannover Re.. Unidentified Participant. We continue with Kamran and switch then to Rötger.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, it's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions. The first one is just I guess it's coming. back to M&A. So we've seen a recently announced merger in Bermuda where we're going. to get the fourth, fifth or sixth largest reinsurance player in the market being created,. depending on whose numbers you use. Do you expect to see any disruption from this. merger? I mean, I guess given their distribution using brokers pretty heavily versus your. retrocession program. So you've improved the program year-on-year, should we expect. the accessory loss ratio, as a proportion of your less earned (1:01:19) premium to actually. Ulrich Wallin. The loss ratio – which loss ratio?. Kamran Hossain. The catastrophe.. Ulrich Wallin. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay, if I first come to the question on M&A, that we have seen in. Bermuda. To the extent that that is reinsurance driven, we see that marginally positive for. us because it means that there is one competitor less. And on the latest one, both are. very respectable reinsurance players. So, you just have in a quoting (1:01:57) panel there,. there's just one left, which it's marginally, not – it's not overly positive, but it's marginally. positive. We do normally appreciate mergers of reinsurers.. Of course, there's another aspect to it. All these merged companies they also have a. primary insurance activities where we are normally a reinsurer of. And then of course. there is an expectation that they would increase their retentions for reinsuring their. primary business. That of course means that in order to keep our volumes there, we. would have to increase our lines to the extent that's possible. So as you can see, it has. some positive and some negative aspects. In general, I would say, we prefer reinsurers to. merger than primary insurers to merge.. And succession on the catastrophe loss ratio. No, that will probably stay reasonably. unchanged because we did not change in absolute terms our risk appetite for cat. And if. you buy a little bit more retro that means that we write a little bit more gross business,. because I mean our risk appetite that we give us for ourselves still limits our cat writing. significantly below what we would have been able to write if would stipulate a higher risk. appetite. We see that very clearly currently, for example, in the Japanese renewals.. Unidentified Participant. Okay. The next question comes from Rötger Franz.. Rötger Franz. Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions about your economic solvency ratio. That. was done quite considerably from 330% to 286%. And I understand that the decline was. almost entirely due to model changes. Can you please elaborate a little bit on what kind. of model changes these were? And also what the key drivers for the decline was? And. whether you expect further model changes? And what impact they could have until you. get the approval. And finally, once the model is improved can we expect a very explicit. target or target range for the economic solvency?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. That's actually correct. We did do some model changes. That was, of course, after. discussions with our regulator where we will actually hand in our application for the. subgroup model for Hannover Re at the beginning of April. And I happen to have a. meeting with BaFin tomorrow. These model changes were largely on the market risk,. basically, on the spread and credit risk where until now as a model had tried a lot of. diversification between the credits and issues.. And in the dialogue with the BaFin it was felt that we should group certain business. segments closer together, which then reduces the diversification and that increased the. capital requirements on that business. That really was the major change that we had. We. believe that with the changes that we have done now that would lead us through the. application process for the subgroup model of Hannover Re. Of course, there will be. future model changes because you have to really look at the model on a constant basis. of course a model change policy that we have.. I would not expect that they will be similarly drastic. At the same time, of course, we will. be looking for target solvency once the model has been approved. That's the answer to. that question really.. Unidentified Participant. Okay. We continue with Andrew.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Three quick questions. One is just a follow-up on your last answer. I don't understand then. why the diversification benefit on page 84 has gone up 51%, if you reduced the. diversification to how come the overall, and as a proportion of the gross capital. requirement gone up, I think from 32% to 36%, so?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah, the diversification within the credit and spread risk was reduced. Therefore, the. number – I think the capital requirement for the credit and spread risk and market risk. widened. But that, of course, meant that if you then look at the diversification with the. underwriting risk, life and non-life, and the interest rate risk, then as the overall risk have. increased, the diversification has increased as well. That is the diversification on the entire. bottom-line capital requirement.. Andrew J. Ritchie. And the growth, there was a significant growth in Life & Health underwriting department,. is that purely volume of business driving that?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah, that's mostly volume actually.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. And the two other quick questions. If I look at your life reinsurance business and. your MCEV disclosure over the last five years, there's been just short of €800 million of. negative operating variances or assumption changes related to U.S., UK, longevity,. Australian DII. You continue to express a lot of confidence in the Life result improving, and. also in your EV translating to IFRS profits. It's a bit hard for us to kind of see that, given the. amount of sort of assumption changes and variances that have been going through. So. maybe do you think you need to do a more thorough kind of ground-up review again of. assumptions? Or we've really passed the worst on particularly the U.S.? I still find it hard to. get comfortable with the outlook there.. The only other question I have, I think the implication is that you booked the unused. budget on large losses. Is that how you want us to think about, Roland, as in the €200roughly-million of unused? And hence that's what's driving the sort of slight increase in. reserve buffer again? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I'll the budget to Roland and we'll try to give you an answer on the Life & Health side.. Clearly, there were negative developments on the DII, the group business and the U.S.. mortality business. We feel that we take these model changes early on to be on the. conservative side there. Of course, in the sooner rather than later, we should come to a. situation about the actual-to-expected and model changes are closer to the zero line. rather than being negative.. I would expect that for the Australian business and the longevity business, we would not. see major changes here. On the U.S. mortality business, I haven't got the same. confidence as yet, so we will have observe that. But as far as the value of new business is. concerned that has not been the, at least the value of new business as we have created. in recent years has not been the source of negative variances or negative model changes.. This has been more business that has been written quite a long time ago or has been. acquired with the ING transaction. So I would say with the underwriting changes that we've. made in 2009, at least we haven't dug us new holes, let's put it that way. And on the.... Roland Vogel. Yes, I can come back and maybe perhaps a short comment on the MCEV. We, I think, for a. few years already mentioned that very openly that we really follow the guidance of the. CFO Forum, which I'm member of, very, very strictly. So also, when other company maybe. adjusted their way of calculating financial options and guarantees or whatsoever, we really. stuck to the methodology. So there is no smoothing (1:12:12), no addressing, so – but we. follow these things. And as the overall numbers are really positive, we look also, I would. say, conservatively or very strictly on the guidance, which led to what you felt is in. cumulated terms an amount of adjustment which affects credibility a little bit, I think. But it. is also a reflection of us really following the rules very strictly.. Coming back on the unused budgets. If we look really at the numbers and the mass €244. million have not been used. We, I think, addressed already over the course of the last. three quarters that some of that falls down a little bit in what is written in Bermuda and in. other areas. So, my guidance would not be that €250 million were strictly added to the. redundancies. But what we see is that the – what I mention is that 93% combined ratio in. Q4 was better than before, so you see something. But if you do the math, while one. percentage point combined ratio translate into what was the net premiums? €70 million,. €80 million, and I would not be surprised if – while we come with the (1:13:49) million. increase in the reserve redundancies. But again, the numbers are not final, but the. message I gave it, it may be not the full amount, but it's a part of that.. Ulrich Wallin. And I think it's also important to understand that a redundant loss reserve or difference to. best estimate is not sitting there like an asset. It's recalculated every year. And of course,. part of the calculation is when you calculate for use of (1:14:20) redundancies because it's. easier for this point, even it's not entirely correctly because of the IFRS accounting.. But you calculate the redundancies at the end of 2013, which means that you do the. triangles and stuff like that. And then, of course, you have an expectation how the loss. payments will evolve over the coming year. If I'm now one year down the line, at the end. of 2014, I look at the same thing. And of course, it's a crazy level of redundancies. determined by the new loss reserves I put up during the year. But also as far as the. existing loss reserves, I then have to look how did the actual payment and advised losses. of 2014 compare with up what I'd assumed at the end of 2013? And then I make the new. calculation, where I then have a new expected cash flow that I assume from 2014 onwards. for the underwriting years in 2013 and prior and new order for 2014. So this can change.. In recent years, it always has improved because partly of the very low inflation. Clearly, for. example, inflation would suddenly increase remarkable. Yes, we would have our inflation. hedge, but outside that, you would see that then certainly also on the loss reserves, say. up until 2014, you would certainly see a higher paid losses and higher advised losses. So. that would then also go against the buffer. And that is also the reasons why we keep that. buffer. It's nice to have it, but it's not like a fixed asset which you can take and, say, take. home.. Unidentified Participant. Okay, that answers your question. So the next question comes from Thomas Fossard and. we continue with Olivia.. Thomas Fossard. Yeah. Good afternoon. I've got three questions. The first one will be again on the capital. position. Back in October 2014, you indicated free excess capital estimates of around €1. billion. That was a year, last Investor Day. Could you update us on the year-end capital. position adjusted for the €500 million you're going to distribute in terms of cash return to. shareholders?. The second question will be to better understand your sensitivity to a strengthening of. the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. Could you provide sensitivity of your net income to. 10% strengthening of the U.S.. And the third question will be related to your German GAAP results. Your equalization. reserves are now reaching €3 billion, so starting to be pretty high level. Could you provide. a kind of – or could you provide better understanding of where your standing compared. to kind of ceiling when potentially the reserves, equalization reserve addition will start to. be a bit smaller than they are currently? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Starting with the last question because it's the easiest. If you do nothing about it the. equalization reserves will reduce most likely significantly in 2017 because of our trade. center loss drops out of the 15-year average. It reduces the volatility very, very. significantly. And that then also reduces the maximum amount that can be – or has to be. put into the equalization reserve.. There is, of course, options by intra-group reinsurance to deal with issue a little bit before. that. That depends how much capital management we need to do. Of course, for us is. the best opportunity is always that we don't need to any capital management because. we can write such nice new profit streams that we can utilize the capital that way. But as. we are not prepared to increase the volatility of our earnings with the current. environment, that's not that likely.. Excess capital position. We haven't calculated end of 2014 as yet, but it's probably fair to. assume that there has been further increase, so the of course retained profitability, but. also the increased economic reserves, so to say from currencies, but more particular of. course also the gains on the fixed income.. And the U.S. dollar sensitivity I would leave that to my CFO.. Roland Vogel. Yeah. Thank you, Uli. Well, first of all, if we look at the impact on the other expense line or. income and expense line, which we have seen this should be zero, that is the translation. of the balance sheet from one balance sheet date to the other. So we had been long, as I. mentioned in the U.S. and other currencies a little bit. Theoretically, of course, that should. be zero.. So I don't really have a sensitivity here prepared for you, but let's do the math together. If. our EBIT is around €1.4 billion, it was nearly €1.5 billion, but let's take the €1.4 billion, and. 40% of our business and net investment income as well as net technical income comes. from the U.S. dollar. So now I, of course, don't know where the next catastrophe or where. the large loss will happen, but everything else equal 40% of the €1.4 billion EBIT should be. U.S. dollar-driven. And if that is, let's assume €600 million, and then you apply your 10% on. €600 million you arrive at a number which gives you a sensitivity.. Unidentified Participant. Okay. The next question comes from Olivia, and then we continue with Janet.. Olivia S. Brindle. Yes, hi there. And the first question is going back to your capital return. And so, I'll take the. point about managing the capital base and €4.25 being quite a nice number. But I just. wanted to get your thoughts on the split between the basic dividend and the special and. especially given you've sort of guided that earnings should trend upwards in the next. couple of years. So why keep the basic dividend flat? And what sort of message does that. send? Could you not have made that €3.60, €3.80 and paid the balance as a special? And. so, just your thoughts on that please?. And then the second question on the Life & Health business, and particularly given the. various issues that you're seeing in parts of the portfolio, I guess you're more aligned. than ever at the moment on financial solutions and delivering very good margins and very. good performance. So just wondering if you could comment on, whether you've seen any. changes there in competitive pressure? And we've seen some peers stepping up their. presence in that area of the business. I think 4Q profit standalone was a bit weaker than. the rest of the year as well. Is there any sort of market changes that you're seeing at all?. So just maybe some thoughts on that business would be great. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. On the split of the dividend. The main reason is that if you look at our guidance for. 2015 and you take 40% of that, that is just shy of €3 per share. So, the ordinary or the. normal dividend is somewhat aligned with our guidance. I mean, even the €3 would be. slightly more than 40%. That's why we left it there. That's the first reason. And the second. reason, the €1.25 looks a little bit more meaningful than if you would have only done €1. So. that's a split, but the first reason is the more serious one.. If I look at the financial solutions on the Life & Health side, we were very successful in the. U.S. where we enhanced the statutory balance sheets. So, I guess we have a little bit of a. first-mover advantage there. Competition has not really increased significantly there. We. have the advantage that if the clients do the deals with us, we have proven that we can. do them. We have proven that the regulators would approve them and, therefore,. actually the pipeline of business is actually increasing rather than decreasing. So that's a. very positive part of the Life & Health business.. Of course if you look at our business that we write in Stockholm and Paris, for example,. that is continuously showing very good profitability. So it's the basket on the Life & Health,. a bit more mix than I would like to see it, but it also has some very positive elements in it.. Unidentified Participant. Okay. The next question comes from Janet.. Janet Van den Berg. Hi. I have two questions. Just a quick question on the dividends. I know that your GAAP. earnings limit your dividend payout to some extent. Does that include the specials as. well? And then further on the EV, I notice that it was driven quite a bit by – the increase in. EV was driven by the German new business. Could you just explain a bit what's happening. there? And also what you expect from margin going forward because I noticed it dropped. a bit? So should we expect a return to mid-teens there? Or will that be a bit lower going. forward? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Yeah. I mean, the – or the entire dividend has to come from the German GAAP. earnings. We call it a special dividend, an ordinary dividend, of course, in the end it's one. number that has to come out the German GAAP profitability. And I didn't EV, you mean. embedded value from German business, new business in Germany. I have – in fairness a. difficulty to follow that because certainly our German Life business we see limited new. business. The German life business at this point in time is quite profitable. But it's largely. financing business that is in runoff. There has been if you look at the P&L account on the. Hannover Re SE or the E&S Re, we have changed our business relationship with E&S Re. and Hannover Re, where in previous years also on the Life side, E&S Re ceded the. German business, part of the German business to Hannover Re and Hannover Re ceded. international business to Germany. We discontinued that.. And that, of course, meant that in the current year the embedded value that was due to,. of course, we discontinued that and paid out the embedded value of the future earnings,. which was positive for E&S Re because the business that they had assumed from. Hannover Re had a higher embedded value than the business that Hannover Re had. assumed from E&S Re. Otherwise on the Life & Health side, the German market is one. where we put great emphasis on, but the actual new business production in Germany is. quite low.. Unidentified Participant. Okay. We have another question from (1:27:57).. Thank you. So we see that in the mortality and morbidity business the EBIT margin is still. below the 6% target. And you're talking about the U.S. mortality, morbidity impact. Is it. possible for you to quantify that and whether without those impacts you get to the 6%. target for 2014? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well the morbidity is negative, I think by 1.7%. And so mortality is actually quite positive,. from memory at 7%. So the mortality is less of a problem, despite the ING portfolio. because there's a lot of other mortality business in the mix that is actually a lot better. Not. least the new business that we have written in the U.S. since 2009. Mobility it's a difficult. class, but I still think that we should see an improvement due to the very high rate. increases that we are getting on the Australian group business. And of course, we have. discontinued that one U.S. health scheme. And I mean that, this year, will help the cash. flow quite a bit because I mean it's a little bit of pre-financing of rebates that our clients. get from the U.S. government. And so we had a negative cash flow last year and part of. that will come back this year, unfortunately, not all of it. So I mean that's why I think we. should reach the hurdle on the combined mortality and mobility in the current year, and I. hope I will not regret that statement.. Unidentified Participant. Okay.. Okay. Well, I think now, we switch to questions coming from the conference call. And I see. that Vikram Gandhi has a question.. Operator. Vikram, go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two of them. One is on the E&C. It's. remarkable that you've been able to improve the attritional loss ratio in this tough. environment. Perhaps you can explain how were you able to achieve that? And more. importantly, how should we think about the FY15 attritional loss ratio.. And the second is I remember you flagged during the Investor Day last year that you're. close to maxing out the redundant reserves. But you seem more confident today about it.. Then if that is something imminent, I wonder why you chose not to increase your FY15 net. income guidance? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. On the attritional loss ratio on P&C in some areas, we are really benefiting from the low –. really the low inflation rate. And if I look, for example, on the German motor business,. which is sizeable part the frequency of losses continues to come down. We also had. some areas where we had increased attritional loss ratios on some of our facultative",20150310_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2015-3-10_FS000000002198853065.pdf,2015-03-10
16,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Q2 2021 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is. being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques. Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. presenting our results for the first half of this year.. As usual, I'll start with an overview before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the. financials in detail. I'll then comment on the outlook for the year thereafter. For the Q&A,. I'm additionally joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller on the Life and Health side;. and Sven Althoff for P&C.. I'm pleased to report that with a group net income of EUR671 million Hannover Re has. successfully taken the next step towards achieving its full-year guidance.. Additionally, we continued to grow our business at attractive terms, at 12.2% the return on. equity, return to pre-COVID levels even though the results of our Life and Health business. group were still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.. Gross premium increased by 14.2% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by. our Property and Casualty business group, where we recorded continued strong top-line. growth on the back of improving market conditions.. The price improvements in P&C markets also support the technical profitability of our. portfolio, which is in line with expectations at a very healthy level. Overall large losses. stayed within the budget. Thanks to a benign impact from natural catastrophes in the first. half.. In addition, our net estimate for COVID-19-related losses remained unchanged compared. to year-end 2020. Hence, the combined ratio of 96% is a good reflection of the. underlying profitability in the first half-year, and additionally, we have built up a further. buffer of EUR150 million for large losses in the second half of the year.. As mentioned, the ongoing global pandemic, it's still having an impact on life and health. reinsurance results. The main insurance market affected by COVID-related excess. mortality continues to be the U.S. even though as expected the numbers decreased over. the course of the first half-year.. Outside of the U.S., we recorded losses in particular in South Africa where Hannover Re. also has a strong market position. All in all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to. EUR263 million in the first six months.. As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio led to a. positive one-off effect of EUR129 million, partly mitigating the COVID impact.. Finally, we reported pleasing premium growth of 7.3% adjusted for currency effects. At. 2.7%, the return on investment is ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable ordinary. income for capitalization according to Solvency II continue to be excellent confirmed by. our strong solvency ratio of 250% at the end of the second quarter, well above our. threshold of 200%.. The operating cash flow in the first half of 2021 was a particularly strong EUR2.7 billion,. mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results on the. investment side. The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from this. restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio of EUR640 million, driven by this positive. cash flow, total assets under own management increased to a record high of EUR52.8. billion. This growth was additionally supported by ForEx effects and the issuance of. EUR750 million in hybrid capital in March this year.. This new bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total hybrid capital to. EUR3 billion. We still have flexibility regards to our total hybrid capacity and shareholders'. equity is up by 0.5%, which is quite positive bearing in mind that we pay the dividends in. the second quarter. However, the group net income in the first half of 2021 was already. sufficient, comfortably cover this dividend payment.. Finally, the change in OCI was only slightly negative because negative valuation effects. were mitigated by positive currency translation.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well.. As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the performance of our P&C business group was very. pleasing in the first half of 2021. Gross written premium grew by a remarkable 17%. adjusted for currency effects, which accounted for 5 percentage point. The growth is. highly diversified, was particularly strong momentum in North America, Germany and. South East Asia. And on top of this, we successfully expanded our structured reinsurance. book where we continued to see a very healthy demand.. As already reported in the first quarter, the recognition of premium from the underwriting. year 2020 supported the growth. But as mentioned also in the first quarter, this effect will. dilute over the course of the year, bringing the premium growth closer to the growth. numbers we reported for our renewals.. Major losses came in at EUR326 million, clearly below our half-year budget of EUR476. million, and as you know, in line with our usual practice we have kept the unused part of. the budget within our IBNR as a buffer for the remainder of the year.. Additionally, we still feel comfortable with the overall net loss estimate of EUR950 million. for COVID-19 and hence, did not see a need to change anything on this front.. The runoff of our reserves was at normal levels in the first half of 2021, development in. second quarter was more favorable than in the first half. As we have not changed our. conservative reserving approach, I would expect the confidence level of our reserves to. be stable compared to year-end 2020. Altogether, the 96% combined ratio is fully in line. with our expectations.. Net investment income increased based on the strong ordinary income and lower. impairments, other income and expenses amounted to minus EUR109 million, mainly. driven by negative currency effects, as we've seen in the first part of EUR77 million.. Altogether the EBIT increased strongly to EUR778 million. Thanks to the improved. underwriting result, which was heavily impacted by COVID losses in the previous year.. Finally, the tax ratio was slightly below the normal level due to a favorable earnings. contribution from lower tech subsidiaries. As mentioned the total net large losses. accounted for EUR326 million in the first quarter, EUR150 million below our budget,. together with the regular budget for the second half this means we have a large loss. budget of EUR774 million available to absorb losses in the second half of this year.. This is a comfortable starting point, I would say, but as we all know that we have already. seen significant losses in the third quarter, with the biggest impact expected to come. from the cloning events in Germany and neighboring countries as well as impacts from. the riots in South Africa.. There is still uncertainty around the flood losses. But our initial estimate would be in the. range of 200 million to 250 million for our net position. For the riots in South Africa, we. expect a net high double-digit million loss.. Adding up those losses this means that we have started to utilize our actually Q3 budget,. but more importantly, that we still have a significant buffer available for the remainder of. the third quarter.. On the next slide, you can see that the largest individual event was the Texas winter. freeze, with the total net loss of EUR136 million, this number reflects an increase. compared to the end of the first quarter, which is mainly the result of late claims. notification.. Still the overall impact from natural catastrophes was below expectations, on the manmaid side we have seen an above average frequency of losses. Altogether, we have. already used up around two-thirds of the full year budget set aside for man-made losses.. The next slide as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting. line, picture is a mixed one as usual for our highly diversified portfolio yet we also do see. material deviations. We do not see material deviations from the target combined ratios,. large losses like the Texas freeze and man-made losses had an impact on a combined. ratios in some of the segments as you can see, but the overall is 96% combined ratio, is. fully in line with our target.. On the next slide, let's move to Life and Health. The pleasing business growth is reflected. both in premium and in value of new business. We were particularly successful in. expanding our financial solutions business in the APAC region, and in longevity, the growth. is starting to also come from outside the U.K.. As Jean-Jacques mentioned the technical result was still affected by losses in connection. with COVID-19, the main impact is visible in our U.S. portfolio where we have recorded. losses of EUR167 million as expected the impact in second quarter was lower than in the. first given the progress in vaccination.. Apart from the U.S., the (inaudible) of the losses from South Africa and as explained at our. Q1 conference call, the restructuring part of the ING portfolio in our U.S. mortality book led. to a positive one-off effect affecting different line items in the P&C [ph]. In total, the. positive impact was EUR129 million partly mitigating the COVID-19 losses.. Furthermore, the underlying mortality experience in the second quarter was more. favorable than in previous years. The ordinary investment income was, I would say, in line. with expectations, the fair value of financial instruments decreased materially and the. negative impact was driven by the valuation of a derivative embedded in a life insurance. contract in the first quarter as we've reported in the first quarter already, while in the. second quarter, the valuation increased slightly.. Other income and expenses are mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution. from our financial solutions business. A large portion of which is recognized according to. the deposit accounting method.. Currency effects was slightly positive in the first half-year and altogether, the EBIT of. EUR179 million hits satisfactory and adjusted for the different positive and negative. extraordinary effect actually slightly better than expected.. On the next slide, as usual, we also have a look at the non-IFRS metric for business. growth in life and health, the value of new business according to Solvency II. On this slide,. you can see that we were quite active in all reporting categories and also the pipeline for. new business remains healthy.. The business opportunities we have seen and are seeing going forward a highly. diversified, but the opportunities are particularly good in developed markets and -- by. reporting categories in the area of financial solutions.. Looking at the indicator for new business value, at the bottom, we have achieved roughly. half of the full-year target, but as you know, transactions in life and health are often right. about the -- and the value of new business is also closely linked to the duration of the. business written. In any case, I think it's fair to say we are well on track in terms of new. business production in life and health.. The next slide, the investments, the development of our investments in the first quarter. of 2021 was very satisfactory in the first half. The ordinary investment income is particularly. strong, this is mainly driven by increased contribution from our alternative investments, I. wouldn't say that these contributions are extraordinary but the distributions of our private. equity funds can naturally be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, this also means that one. should not simply extrapolate those (inaudible) for the remainder of the year.. Further drivers for the strong ordinary results are the increased asset volume in the slide. strategic shift in our asset allocation, which is certainly helping to stabilize the book yet. [ph] in our fixed income portfolio.. Realised gains are mainly the result of normal portfolio management and around EUR50. million are linked to the partial disposal of listed equities in the first quarter.. Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous quarter, where we. had recorded some impairments in the volatile market environment. So this year's. number is more or less as expected low levels, I would say, to a large extent comprising. regular depreciation on our real estate investment.. As explained in my comments on life and health, the derivatives valuation was negative.. The overall return on investments was 2.7%, meaning that we are on a very good path to. achieving our full year target of roughly 2.4%.. Unrealized gains decreased by around 500 million, mainly due to the increase in interest. rate, in particularly in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we've seen some reversing. trends bringing the total to a very high level of EUR3 billion.. On the next slide, a quick glance on the asset allocation, I think it's -- the asset allocation. has developed pretty much in line with our strategy, the most notable change, as you can. see is that we've slightly increased the share of corporate to 32%, here we invested. according to, I would said, a broad-based approach with a focus on developed markets.. The contribution to ordinary investment income is diversified as usual. The highlight is. probably the recovery as mentioned in the contribution from private equity, to the very. strong levels, we had seen before the market volatility caused by the pandemic in 2020.. On the next slide, for the first time, we have also included the final result of the 2020. annual reserve review by Willis Towers Watson, which we usually published for our. investors, let's say. This year the report was available ahead of the Q2 publication and. hence we thought it would not make sense to withhold that information until October.. So looking at the numbers, the overall redundancy level have increased by 80 million in. the year 2020, should not be surprising because it's fully in line with our comments from. March. That still -- it confirms again that the results we achieved in a challenging year 2020. was not at the cost of our reserve and quality, and that the buffer of more than 1.5 billion. remains to be very comfortable.. To conclude my remarks, the overall results for the first half of 2021 does include a few. larger extraordinary effects but both the reported net income and the underlying business. development very much support our guidance for the full year.. And I hereby, hand back to you, Jean-Jacques for the target matrix and for the outlook.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Clemens. A look at our target matrix confirms the successful business. development in the first six months of this year. Growth is significantly ahead of the. strategic targets and our main profitability target for the group. The return on equity is. well above our minimum target.. The EBIT growth targets in P&C and Life and Health are somewhat distorted by COVID. claims. The targets are more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the. strategic cycle.. The mid-year treaty renewals were again successful for Hannover Re, we were able to. further grow our business as improved pricing, one could argue that the price increase of. 3.2% in total and 6.4% in non-proportional business is a slow down compared to the. January and April renewals.. However, I'd like to point out that the rate increases in the mid-year renewals in 2020. were the strongest in terms of rate increases for Hannover Re and therefore the 3.2%. rate increase achieved this year comes on top of a higher basis than in January and April.. In North America, one important driver is the continued positive trend in primary insurance. markets, both in terms of pricing and volume growth. Both factors have a direct positive. impact on our proportional portfolio because we wrote the business at overall stable. commission levels.. In Australia and Latin America, rate increases were most visible in loss affected areas. The. development in credit insurity was slightly more stable, but here too, the quality and. volume of our book went up. Altogether, the growth rate of 14.7% is the highest in this. year's P&C renewals and I'm very pleased with the overall outcome of these mid-year. renewals.. This brings us directly to the next slide. Looking back at all important renewal dates in. 2021, the expectation for the full financial year looks quite favorable. The volume in most. areas is going up at attractive profitability levels, for the entire portfolio, Clemens already. flagged the pickup in loss activity in the third quarter, which together with the outcome of. the hurricane season and other loss activity will determine the profitability levels and also. the momentum for further price increases in 2022.. In general, I'd expect the underlying pressure for rate increases in reinsurance to carry on. to the next year. Mainly because interest rates are expected to stay on the low level and. also climate change related loss trends, which you again became visible with the recent. flood and drought events, will not only further support the need for pricing discipline but. should also act as a driver on the demand side.. Finally, the currently higher inflation levels will also have to be reflected in the upcoming. pricing negotiations. In Life and Health reinsurance growth is expected to be well. supported by our strategic initiatives and most pronounced in financial solutions and. longevity.. In both cases, the profitability expectations are clearly above the cost of capital. In. mortality, there remains uncertainty around the further development of the pandemic.. Excess mortality will be most visible in countries where progress with vaccination. programs is slow. However, the trend in depth in countries where vaccination programs. have slowed at a higher level is also dependent all the management of the pandemic in. the respective countries.. In particular, in the important U.S. markets, we've not seen a reversal of the decreasing. numbers of COVID-related depth. The premium in mortality is expected to be stable and. the same applies for the overall development in morbidity.. As mentioned earlier by Clemens, the business development in the first half of 2021 is in. line with our guidance for the full year. The improved technical results in P&C is fully in line. with expectations and our COVID-19 reserving, in P&C's confirmed to be adequate at. EUR950 million net.. Additionally, the losses already impacting the third quarter. Do not have an immediate. impact on the guidance because we have a large loss budget of EUR774 million available. for losses occurring in the second half.. COVID losses in Life and Health were slightly higher than expected. But on the other. hand, the performance of our investment portfolio is ahead of expectations for the full. year.. So even though some factors within our guidance deviate from our initial planning, we. continue to feel comfortable with the guidance for group net income and has kept it. unchanged.. Also unchanged is our positive view on the dividend policy and the potential to pay a. special dividend if profit targets are reached and our capitalization remains strong.. This concludes my remarks and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you. very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Question And Answer). (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Vikram Gandhi, Societe. Generale. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.. Vikram Gandhi. Hello. Good morning, everybody. I've got three questions, all related to P&C. Firstly,. appreciate the COVID loss estimate is unchanged at EUR950 million but if you can shed. some light on the moving parts within that EUR950 million, whether some of your. estimates are going down, some are going up, lets say, quick insurity coming in a bit. benign, BI going up. Any color there would be appreciated.. Secondly, can you help us with the overall level of IBNRs within that 950 million?. And thirdly, if you can help us understand how the runoff result has developed over the. second quarter on P&C? That would be great. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. Sven will address your questions.. Sven Althoff. Yes, good morning also from our side. Happy to give you a little more insight into our. COVID numbers. So you already heard from Jean-Jacques that the net number stayed at. 950 million as the year end closing 2020. We had very little movement on the gross side. of the loss. We saw some additional claims coming in from the contingency event,. cancellation business, which was roughly 30 million higher compared to the previous. quarter.. All other reviews that developed very stable. So this is the only markable increased on the. gross loss. The reason why is the net position stayed unchanged, is that due to seasoned. advisors more of the property claims moved from bulk IBNR into treaty specific reserving.. So that we could book those losses against our web professional structures keeping the. net position overall unchanged.. On the credit insurity side, you're right. What we have seen so far is relatively low level of. reserves coming in relation to the 235 million, we have booked on that side, but we have. not decided to reduce that number in the second quarter. We will obviously, closely. monitor that situation but I would say that 235 million we are starting to see some. prudency by now.. And it comes to the distribution of pet versus IBNR losses on COVID, we saw an increase. of the pet number going from 15% from the first quarter to 21% in the second quarter,. which of course is fully in line with expectations. The overall level of IBNR, be that bulk or. be that treaty specific IBNR is still at the level of 54%. So we currently feel rather. comfortably reserves with our 950 million on the P&C side.. And it comes to the run-off result in general, the first half of the year and the second. quarter in particular that not show any development which were outside of expectations.. So the run-off, the ordinary run-off result for the second quarter standalone was a positive. 190 million, as I said, fully in line with our expectations.. Vikram Gandhi. Thank you very much.. Operator. Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is. now open.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi, there. Good morning. First question, apologies, if I ask this at every renewal, but I. wonder, Sven, if you could just recap again. How we should think about the reflection of. pricing changes on proportional business? I guess, I think the effectively you're not. obviously reflecting the underlying original change in pricing, you're just reflecting any. changes in exceeding terms. But maybe if you just give us a bit of color again around that. to the extent to which the headline price doesn't necessarily reflect the underlying. economics of the business.. Second question related to pricing. I guess, I'm just interested in opinion on European cat. pricing and then the outlook. I mean, for years, it's been regarded as a diversifier and. therefore it gets heavily subsidized and the pricing doesn't necessarily react too much to. loss experience. Do you think that's going to change with the effect of these losses. and/or higher profile or higher awareness of risk?. And the final question was on the reserve surplus of the year-end '20. How is COVID. reflected in that? I'm assuming the COVID claims are not part of that reserve surplus,. there's no assume surplus on the COVID claim within the reserves. But I'm more. interested in the good news that COVID helped, particularly, in terms of the nine. frequency because I think everyone experienced, an increase -- a technical increasing. that been sort of reflected in the analysis? Thanks.. Sven Althoff. Yes. Let me start with your question on the pricing size, Andrew.. The pricing effect on the (inaudible) side is, of course, mainly driven by the (Technical. Difficulty) consistent, so production including commission, for example, but we are also. reflecting some of the price increases, we are seeing from our leading companies still the. primary market, is when we are looking at price adjusted improvement.. We always take a haircut on the (inaudible). For the simple reason that we are not in full. control of what are the underlying factors when our exceeding companies are reporting. about their rate increases. We not always have full transparency to what extent those. before the numbers are risk adjusted. So therefore, we are taking a haircut, but the. combination of the two would be what we are giving numerous information on the same. pricing on the approval.. When it comes to your question on European cat pricing, we as Jean-Jacques already. said, we still see positive movement in both the insurance and free reinsurance markets.. So a general assumption would be that there will be a small (inaudible) plant in European. cat pricing in general. But of course, we expect higher increases on the lot impacted the. business, would be expected this stage that this is going to be much more significant. increases and you saw for 2020 that I would say we don't have that expectation right now.. And lastly, yes, of course, you're right. The general benign environment in 2020 in many -of business due to COVID, like for example, in motor business, but I would say given that I. don't have a precise number for you, how much status played in to increase in. redundancy that we have reported. Debt reduction frequency is mostly involving very. young underwriting years. We are normally -- we are not needing reflecting any. redundancies in our deposit come [ph] or if we do both very, very limited extent. So this. should not have been the main driver of us showing a higher redundancy --. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Life and Health business. You've pulled. out, I guess, for the first half South Africa was a major part of the claims that you saw in. the life business. Could you maybe talk about how this is Q1 versus Q2, you didn't. specifically go out just South Africa in Q1, but you did it in first half. Just eyeballing a. chance of kind of COVID deaths in the first half of the year, it was pretty bad at the. beginning of Q1 and it didn't really kick up until right at the end of Q2. So just interested in. weather is any late reporting factors or something else going on there? And I guess given. the ex-U.S. component of the life claims in Q2 about EUR50 million I think just kind of -envelope. Is that a reasonable number for us to -- into the third quarter? Thanks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. I'm happy to take that. First of all, most of all our claims are still been from the U.S., so. 60% of the claims we have seen this year is from the U.S., about 20% was from South. Africa and this picked up especially with the delta variant in the second quarter. Main issue. is that the vaccination rates in South Africa are still very low, although they're now picking. up and this is what I would expect around the world in most of the countries, where we. one other example.. Vaccination rates will go up significantly in the next couple of months in these countries. So. I'm not really concerned for the full year, I'm still concerned for the next one or two. months. But in total, this is a small part of our bottom line result.. And -- sorry, what was your question about the 50 million? I didn't quite get that.. Kamran Hossain. -- the ex-U.S. COVID claims in Q2, they look like they're around 50 million, given that. Patrick is now going at a higher pace now, in terms of deaths and it was pretty much in line. with what you saw at the beginning of Q1. Just trying to get an idea where the 50 million. for the quarter is a reasonable number for us --. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. There is certainly a little bit of late reporting here. We have even in developed countries,. the late reporting of four to six weeks for the cause of death, and you can certainly. expect this in South Africa as well.. What is -- especially, a very special in South Africa, a lot of our business in South Africa is. cash financing business. And this has a certain risk, which comes with lapses and with. mortality, but there is an implicit buffer for these cash financing deals.. The client usually wants to have the option to recapture the business after a certain while. and especially when we believes we paid back the initial financing amount and this has a. buffer implicitly built-in and as long as we ultimately get back our money, higher mortality. claims even increase profitability because the treaty just runs three, four, five years longer,. as long as we still get back our money and so we have absolutely no negative from this.. But it might take a little bit longer. So this can be seen as just an additional financing.. Because in certain years like this year, there was a loss and there was no repayment or. recuperation of the initial amount, but if the treaty just runs three-four years longer, we. might not even have a claim there.. Kamran Hossain. Operator. Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is. Vinit Malhotra. Americas bit lower and Asia-Pac a bit improved. And also Asia-Pac you mentioned. us understand what's the magnitude here? I mean and -- what's the rationale for the. Americas lowering results? That could be important.. Then the second question on credit insurity, there is 20 million launch -- mention. Also the. combined ratio 1H is much worse than 1Q, 94% in 1H, 83% in 1Q, is it all coming from this. large loss or is there also something else? Because I think I also heard you're trying to say. that credit insurity still benign for COVID.. Then third question is, seeing your report comment about IO part, harmonization policy. for third country insurance for the convergence plan and you highlighted it as a risk. We -good to know whether you, I mean, how big is the problem you think this could be?. And just very, very quick one, fourth one is, there is a mention of another layer of extreme. mortality cover placed, you comment on whether any life mortality has seen any recovery. from some of these parts? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So, Sven will address the P&C question and mortality will Klaus. On (inaudible). we don't have an immediate answer to your question, I think we might need to come. back to you thereafter on exactly where the information comes from. Sven, first.. Sven Althoff. The reason why we changed the profitability outlook from plus or minus for APAC to plus. and the Americas from plus to plus, minus is just a reflection on the combined ratios, we. are reporting after the first part of the year.. You can see on Slide 10, that the Americas are currently over and above their target. combined ratio, the main driver here, of course, is winter storm Uri, whilst at the same. year.. There are no structural problems in those portfolios from a profitability point of view, but. we just felt it appropriate to switch our two guidances around particularly for the U.S.. because we still have the full hurricane season ahead of us, so it's always a little difficult to. predict how much of a positive catch-up we will have for the remainder of the year to. eventually bring Americas into line with the target combined ratio.. On credit insurity, you're right, as I said, the actually reported losses from COVID so far. have been below or significantly below our expectations. We have nonetheless decided. going into the underwriting year 2021 to have a relatively high ultimate loss ratio picks. compared to the historic average for the simple reason that many economies are only. just starting up after long lockdown period from COVID.. We still have positive government measures in place in many countries, which are bound. to go into run-off at some stage, which of course is leaving the question will we see a. heightened level of insolvencies later in the year. So out of precaution, we have therefore. decided to start the year conservatively from an ultimate loss ratio point of view. And of. course, you're right, one of the ingredients here is the credit loss, we are reporting due to. payment delays for a project engine in Africa. Hope that answers your question on the. P&C side.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Thank you.. Klaus Miller. Then I will continue with the retro cover on the life and health side. I guess, you're. referring to our increase of the pandemic cover, we have recently placed again. So far we. had for this year, and last year we had 255 million cover, which is about to attach or has. already attached.. So we have placed another EUR18 million starting with 1st of January 2021. That means we. have covered this year. Same terms and conditions as previously but the reference year is. always the last year. So we need significantly worse experience for these EUR80 million. compared to last year. And last year obviously was higher than the year before.. So, it still attention says, 110%. But the reference here, is last year. So, it's a little bit more. out of the money, but the EUR255 million, we have in place already are covering us for. this year.. Vinit Malhotra. Right. And we have recorded some benefits already in 1H?. Klaus Miller. No. We have not taken that into account. The reason for that is, we have an expectation. that currently the index is at about 112%, but if the mortality is significantly lower in the rest. of the year and we're not talking about population mortality in general, we talked about. the weighted-average of the population mortality in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and the. waiting is according to our portfolio, if this is significantly better and for instance in. Australia that could be the case because they are all keeping their distance, they don't let. anybody into the country and they keep mortality very low, this also keeps infections very. low and maybe mortality in Australia could even be better than the attachment we. currently see might disappear by year end that's possible or it grows if there is another. variant of the virus. So this is the reason why carefully accounted for we didn't take that. into account so far.. Vinit Malhotra. Thanks, Klaus. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And we'll come back to you. We had a generic statement on IOPA more to comment on. the development of Solvency II rules and the different discussions with the commission. which is like to look at it. There was more of a general statement but we'll follow up with. you on the specific topics which are in under discussion.. Vinit Malhotra. You mean this is all really useful (inaudible) to it generic comment. That's also helpful to. know. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you.. Operator. Will Hardcastle. Hi there, guys. Two quick ones, one long term. Just thinking about the reserve. backdrop. I didn't quite get the answer they're relating to how I should think about COVID. at year end, and how that influences year-on-year, is this blurring the number or could you. just give me a quick answer, follow up also on that if that's possible?. And how do you think about this number, do you tend to give us the absolute number, so. the 1.5 billion or as a percentage of net reserves when considering adequacy sales, when. looking at the business?. And then a bit more shorter time, I guess, is there any more information you can provide. on the European flood loss anything to do with industry loss assumptions, how you derive. your estimate? And whether there's any assumption of retro attaching and perhaps. there's an extension to that. Is there any aggregate protection you have in place that. would therefore more -- be more like these be utilized should the remainder of year see. increased activity? Thanks.. Sven Althoff. The reserve redundancy as Clemens already mentioned, there is a zero impact from. COVID in the reported numbers. So we are not reflecting any redundancy out of our P&C. COVID reserve and the EUR1.5 billion we are reporting form -- the way we are looking at. it, we are of course not only looking at the absolute number but also on the relative. number in relation to our overall reserves.. Here we could see a slight uptick coming from to 5.5% in 2019 to 5.6% in 2020. So the. increase of 18 million was a little higher in proportion than our general increasing reserves,. which of course is a positive developing -- development considering that we have more. than -- we have EUR950 million of new reserves from COVID alone, which of course goes. into that take relation as well.. On the flood loss, we said that we expecting a net position of 200 million to 250 million,. of course, extremely early days in assessing the situation, but (inaudible) we would say. that the associated market loss was this range is between EUR5 billion and EUR7.5 billion.. It's also a little too early to tell how exactly our reinsurance structures will or retrocession. of structures will come into play because so far we have mostly worked on bulk numbers. and in order to know the precise effect on how our retrocessional cover is going to attach,. we need more treaty specific information in order to see what may trigger, what may not. trigger.. So we will, of course, be able to report on that when we are talking about our Q3 figures. in a few months time. But for now, I can't give you a precise information here.. To your last question, I mean, on the property side we are buying three vehicles of. retrocession, one of the proportional contract, our -- transaction, then we have our event. tower what we call our whole account -- loss protection and the last ingredient is our. aggregate cover on large losses, so to answer your question, yes, we do have an. aggregate cover in place, right now given the general benign NatCat environment in the. first half of the year, even with the flood loss we are not near the attachment point yet,. but in case, we should see frequency and severity for the rest of the year, this protection. of course potentially will come into play.. Will Hardcastle. That's great. Thanks.. Operator. Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now. open.. Thomas Fossard. so since the start of the year combining PC and live free, you grow your growth region. premium by EUR1.3 billion. It's pretty significant number. Could you maybe tell us how. much capital this has required to support the growth in the business? That would be the. first question.. And the second question. Just following up on Will's question regarding the redundancy. on the P&C side and because you're bringing this information to us today. Can you talk a. bit more about combined ratio -- reported combined ratio. And I would say the economic. combined ratio because I mean, actually it's now two years in a row where you're. reporting nice improvement in pricing. But I mean you're combining -- your reported. combined ratio is relatively flattish or in line with your guidance but flattish, implying that. actually you're not showing yet any improvement in the margins. So I guess that there is. something going on in the background. So, yes, it would be interesting to talk about. economic combined ratio. And at the end of the day, if there is a -- to go back to the 1.8,. or to somewhat I would say, higher redundancy reserve at the percentage of reserves,. using the current relatively hard market cycle, which will increase again your confidence. level?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Maybe we start with that P&C question on combined ratio, Sven.. Sven Althoff. On the combined ratio is always what we have said over the last couple of quarters when. we changed our guidance from 97% to 96%, is that -- this is a food and approach from. our point of view, we are not translating rate increases one-to-one and two -- ultimate. loss ratio reductions when it comes to our Actuarial picks.. We do take cuts on that and by -- reserve -- conservative initial reserve, which the. profitability will show, but it will show all the time. It will not only show in one calendar year.. But hence, we are comfortable with our 96% combined ratio targets and of course also. quite a bit of our growth is coming from the structured business where margins are. typically in the 2% to 3% area. So what the traditional P&C business is of course seeing. very good levels of rate increase.. The margins on the structured business are relatively unchanged. Here of course our main. competition other financing instruments and you all know what the interest rate. environment looks like right now. So therefore margins on that size have been relatively. stable and that business is standalone would produce combined ratios over and above. the 96% target combined ratio.. Thomas Fossard. Thank you. Clemens, a word on capital consumption?. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. On capital consumption, Thomas, I mean, I don't have the exact nominal number top. of my head, but if I try to answer the question by looking at our Solvency II ratio both at. year end where we stated a roughly fleet 235 and now at 250, say, the main driver. between some movement on credit spreads and interest rates and currencies such as. being, the main driver was with 10 to 12 percentage points, certainly the hybrid.. And I would say a single digit number is really attributable to the business growth. So that. has to some extent, the effect to number, but not to a material extent.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I could add something from the life side here. I know that this is the smaller number of. compared to P&C but even they are you cannot just expect that the premium growth will. be reflected to 121 in the capital requirement. The main areas where we are growing is. longevity, and financial solution and the premium number in financial solutions, just comes. from cash. Cash financing and build lines of business longevity as well as cash financing. diversified very well in our internal model. So, the additional capital requirement are. minimal from the life side.. Thomas Fossard. Excellent. Thank you.. Operator. Our next question comes from Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is. now open.. Ashik Musaddi. Yes. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions I have is. First of. all, sorry to go back on the reserve rudimentary number. I mean, you're at 5.6% at the. moment, historically I think Thomas was flagging this as well. I mean, you were at the. higher number. So, would we have any intention to move to a higher number? What. needs to happen for you to move to a higher number when given the pricing backdrop?. Would you say that you'll be going to work 6%, 7%? Or you're okay with the current level?. And secondly, I mean, if I look at the life insurance because I mean, if I you had large. doses on COVID in this quarter as well as investment income was pretty low compared to. historical standard but yet the earnings were pretty strong on a relative basis like after. COVID and or investment. So what is driving that underwriting thing in life business would. be good to get some color? And just last question is on investment income, your ordinary. investment income increased quarter-on-quarter by about 30 million, 40 million is that the. function of second quarter dividend or is this some one-off some alternative investments. as you mentioned on the course? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Clemens --. Clemens Jungsthof el. I'll start with a first one and then catch up with you probably on the last one, I didn't fully. get it but we can probably pick up that one. So on the reserving side to be honest I think. it's fair to say that, we don't really plan the redundancies sort of as part of our planning. process we do we will do a reserve study of course at the end and we see how, all the. elements it's been mentioned etcetera, how that comes into play and how we can build. up redundancy. Having said that, I think we do feel comfortable with the reserve level that. we have at the moment, but we would also be prepared to build up further buffers as the. surpassed by. And if you wouldn't mind, -- would you mind repeating the last question?. Ashik Musaddi. Yes, sure. I mean, your ordinary investment income increased by about 30 million, 40. million quarter-on-quarter. So, I think last quarter was 330 million to 335 million this. quarter is 375 million. I think the increase -- I just want to understand is that increase just as. -- because second quarter is dividend heavy, the probably you've got some dividend and. that's why it hits an increase or is it driven by any one-off revaluation or anything like that. from alternative investment?. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes, it's really coming from -- mainly from our private equity portfolio. Well spotted, it's. really -- we've seen already is in the first quarter that we saw a pickup particularly. compared to last year on distributions from our private equity investment portfolio and. that has actually accelerated further in the second quarter. So year-on-year, that's really. the increase in contributions in our ordinary income. There's a slight impact also from our. inflation linker. We do see a higher contribution from our inflation linker, but there is a time. lag in the way we amortize these into our ordinary income. So we will see further impacts. probably in the first quarter.. Ashik Musaddi. You mean the positive impact?. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes.. Ashik Musaddi. Okay. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And Klaus, maybe --. Klaus Miller. Yes. I'm very happy to take the life and health question. We have the pretty strong. underlying profitability for our book. This has been a little bit difficult to see in the last. couple of years where we had some brock impact, some disability impacts from Australia. so three, four years ago, but the shift you have seen in our portfolio even for the last 10. years was way from risk business 12 financial solutions business and longevity. And we're. working on that for about 10 years now.. And the financial solutions business has a profitability, which is basically stable in these. times with COVID, longevity is stable or even positively impacted. And of course, we have. significant mortality claims. We have paid 260 million last year, 260 million already this year. in the first half, so more than half a billion of claims, but the underlying profitability is. extremely strong and extremely stable. On the longevity side we expect profit, profitable. cash flow in the next 20-30 years of more than 1 billion. But there won't be any spikes. It. will just come through in the ordinary way, and the way how we calculate and I reserve for. that. So, I'm personally not surprised by those relatively strong results excluding COVID.. Ashik Musaddi. But you would not say that this is like driven by longevity one-off, just because -- just is the. opposite effect of mortality. You would not say just that, there is some underlying as well.. Klaus Miller. It's not run by any one-off on the longevity front. The longevity result was 3.5%. And that's. exactly in line with our expectation, 3.5% of premium margin. Not a really good margin, I. always argue against it, we shouldn't look at it this way, but the expected margin on the. longevity side should be something between 2% and 4%. And we are just in that range. right now.. Ashik Musaddi. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And we have not received any questions at this point, I'll hand back. to the speakers.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much for joining this call. As I think we wanted to convey the key message. that we're well in line with our full-year guidance, we have solid growth across the board.. We have good momentum in P&C with the pricing, solid pipeline both life and non-life.. And we can confirm with a good level of confidence. Our outlook for the year and the. guidance in spite of the continuing COVID burden in Life and Health, in P&C COVID as. discussed is expected to be stable and we can confirm that with this outlook and. assuming result inline with the guidance we intend to pay an attractive dividend, which. would include an extraordinary dividend if conditions are met. That would be the key. messages for today. And thank you very much for joining and see you next time.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded.

17,"Good morning, to all of you. Welcome to Hannover Re's Investors Day 2015. It's the 18th. edition of this event. My name is Karl Steinle. And I'm really delighted that so many of you. were able to take up the invitation.. Since we continue to follow our annual rotation of this event, it's my pleasure to see you. all here in Frankfurt today. I was also very glad that so many of you managed to attend the. dinner last night. I think the atmosphere was slightly different to last year when we ate in. the Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral. It was certainly a good deal less more of it thinking back. on how everyone's eyes lit up at the sight of this beautiful classic cars. And secondly, the. rather lively intense competition we got into over the car racing.. I don't know how you felt about it. But I instantly felt 30 years younger. I must say that I am. also more than a little relieved that they were only model cars and, hence, the numerous. mishaps and rollovers didn't do any damage to our combined ratio of our motor reentrance portfolio.. I would like to express my gratitude to Kathleen who tracked down this marvelous location. and ensure that we all could enjoy such an unforgettable atmosphere.. Kathleen, many thanks.. I would just like to make a few organizational remarks. Please note that we are webcasting. the presentation and the Q&As. Some colleagues have already locked in to follow the. day's event online.. For your convenience, the stream will be available on the Hannover RE's website so you. can review at any time in the future.. With this in mind, during the Q&A, please wait for the microphones before asking. questions.. As always, we have Wi-Fi access available free of charge for you. Please find on your desk. the required password to access the network.. I also like to draw your attention to the feedback questionnaire on your desk. I cannot. emphasize enough how highly we value your feedback into your remarks. We use it. extensively, A, for conveying your comments to management and, B, preparing next. year's Investors Day. You may even leave the questionnaire on your desk or hand it over. to Julia and her team.. You will also find a modest gift on your desk that picks up on the theme of last night's. gathering. It's a model of a classic car, a Volkswagen Beetle. And it's also a special edition. produced for the 1974 Football World Cup. I just know why someone have this particular. one especially because we also have some friends from England around.. But to bridge that gap, in 1974, Hannover Re was only in the ninth year of existence and. managed to write a premium in today's currency of EUR129 million and had a net income. of EUR1.3 million. I think that shows a quite impressive growth. The EBIT margin. nevertheless was already at 17%.. Please take that as a token of our appreciation of your participation today and the support. that you have show Hannover Re over the years.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to our CEO Ulrich Wallin. He will give us some insights. into Hannover Re's strategy in this competitive environment.. Ulrich Wallin. Thanks, Karl. Good morning. Thanks for coming and hope you enjoyed yesterday evening.. It's actually quite interesting that the slowest car on the race track was actually winning all. the time.. You still feel that at Hannover Re we are fast and flexible. Hopefully, we don't roll over all. too often. But so far so good.. I mean, what I'd like to try to explain to you why we feel that as a somewhat different. reinsurer that has reinsurance as its core business, we still feel that we have a very good. opportunity to be long-term successful in that business because the pure, almost pure. reinsurer; I mean as a species that is not actually increasing the numbers because many of. our peers have decided that insurance is more attractive than reinsurance so they are, I. mean, more going into the insurance field. And some of them actually almost leaving the. reinsurance completely, which we always think is a very good idea. The only thing that. some of them to do that sets not actually a good idea that they don't reinsure the primary. business that they're on.. But be it as it may, we still feel that our business model where we clearly say that. reinsurance is our core business. We write some insurance. But it's complementary to the. reinsurance. So that is a business. It's a competitive business. But we feel that this. business has the opportunity to be successful in the long-term.. So look at the landscape and I was telling Karl he don't have to do the switching for me. and, of course, (technical difficulty) to the first slide.. Here we are. This gives you the landscape we are operating in. This is a nonlife. reinsurance market. And first of all, as you can see from 2010 to 2014, a time when we. already talked a lot about increased retentions, the market was actually growing. I mean, it. grew from -- I mean, EUR160 million to about EUR190 million. So there was growth in the. market.. It also, I mean, the EUR190 million still is small compared to the insurance market. I mean,. on the P&C side, the insurance market is about 20 times that. So I mean, that means that. reinsurance, in the overall scheme of insurance and reinsurance, you can probably say it's. still kind of a niche market. And -- but we still like it.. You can also see that the nonlife reinsurance market is enormously fragmented. I mean, if. you look at the top 10 reinsurers, the average market share is only 4%. And if you look at. the top 50, the average market share is below 1.5%. So we have a huge number of. entities that are involved in the reinsurance business, which shows you that the entrance. hurdle to this market cannot be very high.. If you look at the tiering, which is, of course, very passionate to talk about tiering of the. business, you can see that the top 10 reinsurers for growing a little bit faster than the. market as a whole. And this, of course, because, I mean, the ceding companies have a. tendency to work these large diversified reinsurers. So the medium-term reinsurers. actually shrank, which you might say you shouldn't be in the middle, you should be either. small and specialized, a large and diversified.. It's not entirely true because in that group of 11 to 50 you have all those companies or. many of those companies are writing reinsurance and insurance. And many of those,. when the market started to soften put more emphasis on the insurance side. But you can. also see that is combined entities where you have many in Bermuda, for us, are good. competition because we are not that aggressive on the reinsurance side.. But what you also can see is the fastest-growing group were the others. So 50 to several. hundred. And that just show that you have, of course, all the ILS markets coming in there. because none of them is large enough to hit the larger ones. And you have, I mean, a. small reinsurer setting up, local reinsurers, which all gather some business.. What is our strategy in this field? First of all, you can see that we have grown a little bit. faster than the market. You can also see that we have grown slightly faster than our peers. in the -- peer group off the top 10. But we feel that when the time is right, we should be. able to grow in that business by gaining market share. And we have done this all along in. the existence of Hannover Re. But only when the time is right.. I mean, yes, we grew our market share in 2009 and 2012 but, of course, we didn't grow. our market share in 2013 and '14 when the market was more competitive. But we feel.. And this is important for us, that in this market, we can grow in the long-term by gaining. market share because there are so many small reinsurer that would allow us to do that. because, I mean, we are relationship reinsurer and many of our clients want to do more. business with us rather than less. And this is an opportunity that we have, one of the. reasons what we like to be in this rather fragmented market.. The other thing on the P&C reinsurance, the business is rather instant. I mean, the. business results that we have this year is depending, for the most part, on the business. we write this year and last year. As long as we are there reserved for the past, I mean, the. business changes quickly. Look, in 2001, the business changed due to 9/11. And you could. benefit from it rather immediately. There is a different situation in the Life & Health side. where the business is much more driven by the in-force book.. So I mean, as you can see in Life & Health, smaller market, only $57 billion, which, of. course, is a fraction of the insurance market because the Life and Health insurance market. is, of course, larger than the P&C insurance market. But the reinsurance is largely only the. biometric risk that the reinsurers are taking on. They are normally not involved in the. savings part of the business. That is why the percentage of the premium that is needed. to the reinsurance market is even smaller than it is on the P&C market.. You can see that the market, however, is growing. And it has grown a bit faster than the. P&C market. You can also see that here the larger reinsurers grow fast. And really the. market is dominated by seven players, I mean, they have basically that business is. dominated by very few players.. They are not the many small reinsurers that are involved in that business and that shows. you that the entrance hurdle to the Life and Health market is a lot higher, is actually very. high. So for new reinsurers, getting into this field and, I mean, gaining reasonable ties is. very difficult. I mean, you basically can only do it by buying in-force business.. If you are dependent on developing new business, that's a long haul because if you look. at the new business, new business premium that is placed any one year it shouldn't be. significantly less than 10% of your volume. And of course, as a newcomer, you cannot. hope that immediately you get, say, a 10% and 15% share of the new business. That's just. not happening. That's why the entrance hurdle is so high here.. Of course, with such a concentrated market, growing back position is not exactly easy. because the targets are few and far between. I mean, for us, it's basically six targets. And. I think the majority of them out of reach or we don't really want them. So where we see. our position, as we grew with the market here, our position is that we try to enlarge the. universe of the life reinsurance market by creating solutions with our insurance partners. that create reinsurance business that is currently not reinsured. And we do that both on. our financial solutions business as well as our growth initiatives, which Klaus will give you. the details in his presentation.. So a very different approach, very different market, life and nonlife reinsurance. But of. course, you can see that, I mean, the Life & Health market, if it's dominated by the results. from the results from the in-force business is a lot less cyclical because if you look at the. results, say for 2015, to the smallest part will depend on the business that you write in. 2015. But so the fiscal year result depends on all the back years not on the current year.. So if the current market suddenly because somebody new comes in would be very. competitive, it would not have a major influence on this year's and next year's fiscal year. results that we are able to show. And that's why Life & Health stabilizes our results and. reduces the volatility. That's why we like that business.. We believe that in the current market picture, certainly on the P&C side, is a soft market. and it much reminds us for those that have the gray hair like me on the late 90's. So many. of the dynamics in the markets are very similar. But we believe that if you are very. diversified and have a broad-based account, you have a better chance to be successful in. this difficult market.. And as an example, I show you this slide. This one, the light blue line, shows you the. development of the rating of the property catastrophe business. So it's just the Guy. Carpenter Property Catastrophe Rate-on-Line Index.. And you can see that the last two years in 2014 and '15, we have seen a sharp decline of. the business. You can also see that 2013 was still rather flat because we only really started. to reduce the rates mid-year. But the (1.1 and 1.4), we were able to keep rather stable.. But then you see that the German motor business is actually not following the same cycle.. Actually, since 2010, we see great increases. And this is business that we, as Hannover Re,. through our German subsidiary, E+S Re, have access, too. But many of the players in the. market haven't got the same access. So there you can see that if you brought this, you. can shift more towards those lines that are still attractive and German motors, just used. as an example here, which shows that our positioning is actually favorable even if the. market is declining like it currently does. And on the property catastrophe, it may actually. continue to do into 2016 at least early renewers are not all that encouraging in that. respect.. So worldwide diversified reinsurer has an opportunity to be successful even in the difficult. market. We are, as you know, the third largest reinsurer. We have a very broadly. diversified book of business. And what really helps us that we are involved in so many. classes. So with many of our clients on the P&C side, we have not the largest share of the. business. But we have the largest number of treaties. And that gives us a very broad. relationship with our clients, which means that even if you get off of some of their treaties,. we still keep the relationship, which is very important because that's the only way we still. can be opportunistic in this market.. I mean, it's not really feasible at our size to desert our clients completely and hope that. when the market changes, we would be able to come back. We need to keep the. relationship because we are a relationship-driven market.. But as we have set a broad base with our clients, on individual treaties and individual lines,. we can be selective. And we are selective because we also see a lot more business than. we write. And this is quite a comfortable situation particularly on the current market, which. is characterized by the huge overcapacity that doesn't hurt us with access to the business. of course it does hurt us when we want to get the prices and conditions that we need. because what our clients left us is they left us reduced if they have to pay 20% more to us. and then to our peers simply not doing that.. I mean, on the ILS market we were talking about that, I mean, new entrants into our. markets that has actually put additional pressure on the market. However, I mean, the ILS. market only is involved in rather small part of the market. It's really only the short-term. property catastrophe market or if they are involved in longer-term business, not on a likefor-like basis only if the business is commuted early on. So only if the client that feeds. business to them is prepared to take basis risk. So it's a narrow focus.. And of course, the results of the ILS market in the long run as they are so heavily. concentrated on property catastrophe in the US will be more volatile than the diversified. reinsurer and, therefore, their reactions on major claims will most likely be harsher than. from the traditional reinsurer. So from that point of view, I would say they would probably. amplify the cycle certainly on the cat side not mitigated as many people think.. For us, I mean, we started to work as the capital markets in the mid-90's. Actually,. Eberhard who is our chief risk officer, he was involved in the first ever transaction that. reinsurance risk was transformed into the capital market, our Kcover transaction. And we. have continued to work with the capital markets. So I mean, we partner with many of. them. So for us, yes, they are threat on one hand. But they are friends on the other as. well. And they are also a source of a profit for us, actually quite attractive profit. And. they're also a source of retrocessional capacity for us because, I mean, more than 50% of. our retrocessions will reduce the volatility of our earnings are actually provided by capital. markets and not by traditional reinsurance capacity.. And if we will show you and this is one of the themes of this Investor Day this year, we. continue to have ample opportunities to write new business. And we continue to have a. lot of initiatives to get involved in new business, to have specific solutions for our clients.. And I have to say that 2015 so far in that respect was quite successful, more successful. than we normally expected to be. And that's the reason why, in the first half, etc, probably. continues throughout the entire year.. We grew our Property and Casualty business a bit faster than we expected because we. had a gross of 10% on a currency-adjusted basis, which is counterintuitive if you think that. we are really in a soft market.. Diversification, you can see that on the left side you see the geographical diversification.. And you see that in the last 10 years we improved that diversification quite remarkable.. You can see that the US portion reduced or the North American portion from 50% to 27%.. That also has to do this effect that in 2004 we still have the Clarendon Insurance Group,. our somewhat less successful endeavor into the primary MGA market in the US. But you can also see that our fastest-growing areas were actually Asia and Latin America.. And we write an excess of EUR2 billion of business from Asia. And Latin America is coming. close to EUR800 million. And you can also see that Asia, for us, is more important now. than our home market, Germany, where we only have 9%, also a percentage that have. come down. So that really shows you that geographically, we are -- we are broad-based.. And we grow in those markets that grow because our growth in Asia and Latin America. also has been with the underlying reinsurance and insurance business in those market has. been growing quite nicely.. On the right side of the chart, you see the diversification by line of business. And this is, of. course, important for us to be in all those lines of business. But because as I showed you,. there's the example of the German motor business that -- I mean, not all classes move in. sync. I mean, there's different movements in the different lines.. You can also see that the property cat business of our overall business, including the Life. and Health, is only 2% of our overall income, which mitigates, of course, the effect that the. continued reductions of the rate have on our results and also volatility of our book of. business.. A little bit of account arguments, yes, while it is only 2%, of course, it's a much larger. percentage of our profits in a good year. And of course, it's a much larger source of. volatility, negative volatility in a bad year. So despite the fact that's only 2%, I would say, of. the EBIT in a normal year then nothing happened, it would still be around 15%. So it is. important. But it is very diversified with other business as it produces the majority of our. profit.. And you can also see that the diversification also within the business group is group,. particularly also in the Life & Health side where we have both a growing part of our. longevity business that is uncorrelated to the mortality and the morbidity business. So. again, we feel having this diversification is important to be successful in the current. market.. This page shows you the various segments of our business and how they have performed. in the various calendar years. And I would tell just take 2011 that, of course, was the year. where we have the catastrophe losses in Asia, the earthquake in Japan, flood in Thailand.. You also had the earthquakes in New Zealand. And as a result, of course, many of the. smaller, more specialized reinsurers in that year actually had a bottom line loss. But we still. have the ROE of 12.8%, mediated a little bit by a positive tax effect.. But you can see this is the result of the diversification because, yes, the headlines in 2011,. where we were losing money. But as headlines such as for example, in that year aviation. and some other classes performed extremely well. And so that shows here that. diversification actually has a positive effect on the reduction of the volatility of the results.. And that, of course, since 2009, that's what we are striving to do to reduce the volatility. of our earnings.. This gives you the results from our economic capital model and, I mean, without stealing. Eberhard's thunder, I would say that Hannover Re's group model was the first model that. has actually been approved by any regulator in Europe. But Eberhard will give you all the. details. But he also has this line, therefore, I will not dwell a lot on this but for it just shows. you that diversification within the risk groups as well as for the company as a whole is a. very important part because it allows us to write larger profit streams on our capital base. saying we would be able to do if we would only be involved in a smaller segment of. classes.. I was telling you that we have business opportunities and initiatives at all times. And if you. -- if I go under Life & Health on the P&C business, this gives you our initiatives from the. last 20 years just a few of those to illustrate that we're always involved in new business.. In the mid-90's we started the structured reinsurance. But actually we had it as a separate. business group at one point in time. But this business is basically allows our cedants to. manage the volatility of the earnings and the capital requirement on a structured basis,. meaning this reduced risk transfer, not without risk transfer but reduced risk transfer. And. we have written this business for the last 20 years.. Right now it's actually a growing part of our business because due to the increased. retention of many of our clients, they are looking to buy facilities to reduce the capital on. their retention and the earnings volatility that they have created by those larger retention.. They are seeking the respective solutions from us. And therefore, at this point in time, this. is a growing part of our business.. Facultative reinsurance close to my heart because I got the responsibility for facultative in. 2000. Then we had the loss-making facultative book of EUR70 million.. Meanwhile, of course, with the help of Andre Arrago, who retired last year, we have. increased that to more than EUR1 billion. And it's a major pillar of the profitability of our. non-life business now, our P&C business.. Retakaful, another of our initiatives, we were the first of the traditional reinsurers setting. up an Islamic-compliant reinsurer. This business has grown nicely and is particularly. profitable for us on the Life and Health side, which is really -- I mean, the roots really of. the Islamic compliance insurance.. Then your Credit and Surety 2009, when everybody else got out of that market, we. increased. That actually has until today a very positive effect because we moved from the. following market with some lead business to be one of the two main leaders in this. business.. This business, of course, now has become very competitive. But our market position has. been strengthened enormously so we continue to see very good profits from that. business more than we would have seen if we would have this drawn in 2009 as well.. UK motor excess as of losses fell out of fashion with most of reinsurers when the PPOs of. the periodic payment orders came into effect in the UK we gave full cover.. Now, we can say that was the right move because the number of PPOs in the markets are. few and far between so that's a much higher rates that we get on that business we can. now see, that we have a better deal than for those reinsurers that were writing the. business only on capitalizing on the PPOs early on.. Then most recently, personal lines initiative in Asia, where we get in touch this group bias. of insurance, provides them those fronting companies that also normally takes retention. so we create business for the reinsurance market that wasn't there before. That's a very. successful initiative of our office in Kuala Lumpur. So as you can see, as a result of that, the. business over the time has grown nicely on the P&C side.. Of course, 2000 and 2008, following the World Trade Center, we grew very rapidly. Then. we had a time of that development mainly when we got out of the Clarendon business. and when we started only to write business from our parent companies, the Talanx. Primary Group HDI that we keep not write all of their business and retroceded into the. market.. But I would say since 2009, we have grown the business again and since then the. compound growth of 9% is actually quite attractive. But you can see that in recent years. we are not growing homogenously in all years to the same extent. But 2012 when the. market conditions were good, our growth was more pronounced. The same is true, of. course, in 2009 and the market hardened after the financial crisis. Same was true in 2006. and 2001. So we feel on the P&C side it's important to grow at the right time and not the. same every year.. You can see that we have continued growth not only on the top line but also on the. bottom line. We were growing and this slide just to show that it's good quality results that. we achieved on the business because we achieved it not at the expense of reducing the. profitability with increasing the confidence level of our reserves. So it was not the case. that we were showing profits at the expense of the future profits. I feel that that shows. there's a quality of the results if you were able to achieve on the P&C side.. On the Life and Health side, similar, also there we always have growth initiatives. These. are only very few examples. And Klaus and Claude could show you a lot more and we. have actually a lot more on the go. But I will not steal Klaus' thunder here.. Just to mention here the US financial solutions in 2009, this is where we have a little bit of. the first move advantage because on the so-called non-economic XXX and AXXX. reserves. They were supported all along by LOC capacity that was provided by the banks.. In 2008, due to the financial crisis, the cost of LOCs increased dramatically so we were. able to provide our US clients with structures and solutions that they could see the noneconomic reserves to optimize their capital on a statutory basis and a lower expense than. the increased LOC cost, a letter of credit cost would dictate. This has been a very positive. movement for us, a very profitable business.. And you can see as a result, the value of new business that we are creating continues to. increase. And you see this is a very nice graph. But Klaus would tell you more about it.. I would say the value of new business is expected discounted future positive cash flows. from the business. And it also deduct the future cost of capital. This means that if. everything goes according to plan and your assumptions are proven to be right by reality,. the IFRS profit over time will actually be about twice as much as a value of new business.. If you then go just a brief look at the makeup of the value of new business, you can see. that financial solutions has been the largest contributor. And this, to a large extent, from. the US business I was just telling you this is just an example of the years 2013 and '14.. I would also say the future cat flows that are shown here in the value of new business. have a very different duration. Whilst the financial solutions is relatively short duration that,. on average, I would say is around five years, which means that this value of new business. is transformed into IFRS profit rather rapidly.. For example, the US mortality, much longer duration, I would say around 20 to 25 years,. expected future cash flows so you will have, of course, see that, I mean, the IFRS result on. that business is really created by the back years, not by the newly created value of new. business. But it is, of course, constant expected profitability for the future. And on the. longevity business, it's even longer term. I mean, this is 30 plus years. So we can see the. makeup is very different and, therefore, also the transformation from value of new. business into IFRS profit is very different as well.. That is just what I wanted to tell you about that.. So that, I mean, that positive value of new business and our gross initiatives. And our. growth initiatives, we feel that we have outplaced to see continued growth of the. profitability of our Life & Health business.. An important component of our earnings is, of course, the investment income that we are. achieving on our business. On the investment income, of course, we are negatively. impacted by the continued low interest rate environment. I mean, reducing interest rate. environment normally is not much of a problem because you have the investments from. the previous years and just the unrealized gains are just increasing.. But once the bottom is reached and the interest rates continue to be low, of course, it has. the results that the yield on the investment is increasing, in particular, if you leave -- if you. a percentage of the overall invested assets coming down. This is just the ordinary. investment income so it's outside, I mean, realizations and things like that.. But you can see that still we were able to keep the level in absolute terms constant. And. the reason for that is that we have an increase in the assets and their own management.. So the invested assets increase so we hide lower interest rates that's higher volumes.. And of course, part of the increase in the assets is just the increase in market value. But. the much larger part is the continued very positive cash flow that we have on our. business. Therefore, we feel that we should be able despite reducing yields also in the. future that this would keep the absolute level of our investment earnings rather constant.. This slide sums it all up and this slide really is the essence why we feel that we are. confident for our 2015 profit guidance. And we feel that those bullet points and. parameters that are shown here will also put us in good state to continue to be successful. in the medium-term even. And that's not entirely unlikely even if the soft market continues. and even if it softens a bit further.. One bullet point I would like to mention here, which is, on the P&C side, where we say we. will have difficulty to further increase the confidence level of our IFRS loss reserves. And. you have seen the first part of that in 2014 that we increased the redundancies further in. absolute terms but not in relative terms. And it's really because we hit the boundaries of. what is possible on the IFRS accounting. But we are still in a very comfortable position. there to weather the storm of the soft market.. Important, of course, that we continue to have an attractive admin expense ratio. compared to our peers.. Coming then to the profitability of the business, you can see that our capital base has. continued to increase. And actually throughout this period, the average -- the overall. increase was about 41%. The good thing is that from 2011 to 2014, the profit actually. increased by 62%. So as long as this is the development, we don't mind the increase and. the capital because then the ROE would continue to increase.. because due to the capital losses 2011 was, of course, not the most profitable year.. But if you look at the same from 2012 to 2014, I mean, the capital grew by 22%. But the. Therefore, if you see that in the excess capital then, of course, we have to, I mean,. we take, the extraordinary dividend of EUR1.25. And I said all along, we likely continue to. That brings me to this slide, which is probably one of the most important one of my. presentation because the big question, of course, is will the market stay soft indefinitely. or will the market continue to be cyclical.. What this slide shows you is the average RoE of the top reinsurers, which is the light blue. line. And you can see in the dark blue line again the Guy Carpenter Rate-on-Line Index for. the property cat business as a proxy for the market development that we have seen.. And you can see that in the years 2008, 2005. And 2011, the average RoE of the. reinsurance market dropped below 5%. And each time that was happening you can see. that there was a reaction in the market. Each time that was happening actually the market. hardened and gave us an opportunity to grow our business organically.. You can see why the market continues to be soft because in 2014 and so far first half of. 2015, the RoE stayed at double-digits. And as long as that remains, the pressure on the. management of reinsurance companies is not there to do something about it, about the. profitability of their business. And therefore we are seeing a continued soft market.. But I am convinced that should either through continued erosion of the quality of the. business all through a major loss, the RoE again falls below 5%. We were still against the. reaction. And of course, the reaction there would be more pronounced if it falls lower and. it will be less pronounced if it's just like, say, 2011 where it was, by no means, a dislocation. in the market but it was just, I mean, a frequency of medium-sized cat losses.. So from this point of view, I would say if you are able and this is our strategy to be more. profitable than our peers is downturn of the market, we should be able to benefit, I mean,. That is how we try to position Hannover Re. And only time will tell if we are successful in. that. But that is why we have the low expense ratio that is why we have a stable Life &. Health business. That is why we have the buffers on our reserves exactly in order to. achieve that.. So to sum it all up, reinsurance is a competitive but growing business. Reinsurance offers. us the ability to grow in excess of the market. And reinsurance, particularly on the P&C. side is continued to be a cyclical. Reinsurance is a good tool for insurance companies to. manage that capital and earnings, also if they go into new businesses like cybersecurity.. We'll tell you the details about it's an opportunity for reinsurers to support the insurance. industry. And therefore, we feel that doing a business that our core business is. reinsurance, we can be successful in the long-term.. Thank you very much.. Now I'm happy to answer your questions even though I have run a little bit over the time.. Questions And Answers. Karl Steinle. okay. We already have some questions. First, we start with Vinit. And please, Vinit, wait for. the microphone so that all the participants following us through the webcast can hear your. question as well.. Vinit Malhotra. Sure. Thanks, Ulrich. So Vinit from Mediobanca. Just one question really. This 5% trigger. that you seem to suggest Hannover is waiting for again grow, what if it really doesn't. happen. So what is the strategy or idea if this is not really the case?. Ulrich Wallin. If the average RoE of the reinsurance market always take double-digit, we will continue to. be profitable and be happy with that as well. So we are not waiting for the RoE of the. reinsurance market fall to below 5% because if it stays high, we have the opportunity to. continue to be profitable.. However, with the current trend of the rate, which, of course, also as a result of the. absence of major cat, it would be an optimistic view that we can continue to reduce the. rate. But never fall our RoE below 5%. So I mean, of course, if the market continues to. have double-digit RoE, our low expense ratio market position is a very diversified. reinsurer, we feel that we will just continue to grow our profitability.. But if gravity comes to reality, then, of course, the market will drop and therefore our. game plan is to be prepared for that drop and to be less affected the said drops and the. average market player to benefit from the uptake after that.. Karl Steinle. okay. Any further questions? Okay, we continue with Michael Huttner and then with Frank. Kopfinger.. Michael Huttner. Just on the Life, I just came in so I'm really sorry I'm late. But the EUR750 million new profit. and you say the IFRS profit did twice that. Given that you're getting new business profit. every year at that level, should we expect therefore your Life profit be EUR1,500?. Ulrich Wallin. Well as I said, I mean, the value of new business is the expected future cash flows. discounted to present value and taking off the future cost of capital. But as I explained, I. mean, the duration is rather long. I mean, if you look at the longevity business, this will. evolve into IFRS profits over the next 30 years. So it's not eminent other than maybe the. financial solutions, which is short as I explained. And I mean, we will only have those profits. if our assumptions that of the basis for the calculations of the future cash flow are holding. through on the test of time.. Of course, I mean, say on the mortality business, if the mortality reduces more than we. expect, our profits will be higher. But you see, mortality is higher than expected. Of. course, our profits will be lower and, of course, on the longevity is exactly the other way. round, therefore, we like that diversification between the longevity and the mortality. But. yes, I mean, that's not imminent. But we are confident that, as a result of that, we will be. able to gradually increase the profitability of our Life & Health business.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Next question comes from Frank Kopfinger.. Frank Kopfinger. comfort level that you will be comfortable going forward to keep.. Ulrich Wallin. we are still based on, I mean, on the IFRS best estimate requirements that you have for. accounting. We still have a very conservative best estimate. So I mean, if that would drop. in a soft market, say, to 4%, 5%, we were still in the green and in a comfortable area. So I. mean, it definitely need to stay there.. It was very helpful, I mean, to grow it to that level in the really very favorable trading. conditions that we had from 2009 to 2013.. Karl Steinle. Any further questions? From Roland Pfaender on this side.. Roland Pf aender. Good morning. Could you provide us maybe with your view on the current growth of the. P&C reinsurance industry? According to the figures we presented, it was growing by a. little bit more than 4%. Do you think that might be materially lower than next year's? And. do you see any disconnect in relation to the primary insurance outlook? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well I would say if you just look at premium growth, I mean, currently this year you will. probably see a continued growth of the reinsurance market and you might also see that. next year. That is the result that, on the one hand, yes, you have a lot of the larger groups. taking higher retentions. But we still see business growth in the emerging markets just. Asia and, to some extent, Latin America.. And also in the established market, the primary insurance rates coming under pressure as. well, I mean, there is more proportional reinsurance board in the market. So from that. point of view, I think the volume that the major reinsurers write in the next few years. would probably continue to rise. The quality of the business will presumably reduce due to. the soft market because, I mean, up until recently I would say maybe outside a few line of. business like aviation, the primary market rates were holding up better than the. reinsurance market rates. But it seems that particularly in the US now also the primary. market rates come more under pressure.. So I can't see any other questions right now. So if that is the case, I would like to thank you. for the questions. And we will now break for a coffee to get refilled.. The next presentation will be from Eberhard. And he is presenting the reserving position.. And we also will hear from Andreas Maerkert about the capital position.. So this will be feelingly interesting. But we have to contain our excitement until 10:30. when we continue.. Unidentified Participant. Yes, yes.. +++presentation. Karl Steinle. Well thank you for taking your seats again. The next highlight that awaits us is the. presentation of Eberhard Mueller on the reserving position.. I have to tell you that we have celebrated Eberhard's 61st birthday just a few weeks ago,. which means that this will be the final occasion on which he addresses you all at the. Investors Day. His presence here is something, which I personally will really miss.. Fortunately though, his presentation will be recorded so we can look back whenever we. wish. With Eberhard sadly leaving us soon, you may ask yourself how is Hannover Re going. to manage without him. Well you can see the answer already on the slide.. It's my pleasure to introduce Dr. Andreas Maerkert. He has been with Hannover Re since. 2004. And he is, by nature a mathematician and actuary. Andreas heads the department. capital model and the associated applications including the risk capital allocation, also the. definition of the limit system and the solvency to internal model application.. Andreas will not only be taking charge of group risk management. But also will assume the. role of the group's CRO.. Eberhard, would you like to start the ball rolling?. Eberhard Mueller. Definitely. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for this nearly perfect. introduction, Karl. We will do today the same procedure as every year. But with two voices.. I will start from the actuarial side with a more boring stuff. The update on the P&C claims.. But you know when an actuary tells you he is boring is the best he can tell you, it means. stability.. From the more exciting stuff, I have only one piece here. That's the letter from the BaFin. telling us that our internal model is approved dated 30th of July this year. I think it's the. first of its kind in Europe. But all the details will be brought with them on the risk. governance capital monitor and capitalization update internal model approval for Solvency. II and sources of risk and exchanges in 2014 by Andreas, the final five minutes after I am. closed.. Okay. Andreas is, as Karl mentioned, running our internal model since a couple of years.. And he was doing all the hard work through our entire pre-application process that. started in September 2008. And now with this letter, now we both earn something from. our efforts.. I will start on the reserves with the usual picture, the makeup of the overall reserves,. which meanwhile is EUR35.8 billion, another EUR3.2 billion more than last year.. Left-hand side, you will see the 58% property and casualty reserves being EUR20.8 billion,. increase of EUR2 billion compared to last year. And the details are EUR12.8 billion from. Hannover Re, EUR3.5 billion from other subsidiaries, EUR2.7 billion from our German. subsidiary E+S Re. And the branches are contributing EUR1.8 billion.. On the right-hand side, we have the 42% being EUR15 billion, which is EUR1 billion more. than last year, EUR1.6 billion split up EUR11.7 billion for benefit reserves and EUR3.3 billion. for loss reserves.. I will concentrate in the next couple of slides as usual on the P&C loss reserves, which are. very similar to what I presented you last year.. The US is now EUR5.5 billion being 27%, slight increase. It used to be 25% last year.. In Germany, a slight drop of two percentage points to EUR2.9 billion, used to be 16% last. year, now it's 14%.. The remaining Europe EUR3.8 billion, a drop of 1%.. Rest of the world being stable, 18%, now EUR3.8 billion.. UK/Ireland, slight increase, 1%, to EUR4.7 billion.. And on the right-hand side, you'll see how we check those reserves and how we make. those reserves.. From our home office reserve unit, the reserves are more or less controlled for Hannover. Re, E+S Re in Germany. For our Canadian and France branches, for the Bahrain/Takaful, for. Sweden. And from two years ago for Bermuda.. We have external appointed actuaries covering 4% that's less than EUR1 billion in Australia,. Malaysia. And Shanghai driven by local requirements. And we are doing with our own stuff.. But at the local level the reserving for Ireland and South Africa. As you know, IICH. meanwhile has been relocated to Germany from 1/1/15 onwards. And they are also doing. their own reserve analysis. But with -- having impact from Group Risk Management.. This slide you are all looking for comes now. All those reserves are going into the peer. review by Towers Watson. And those peer reviews show the difference in the best. estimate Towers Watson is assuming, the best estimate we are assuming for saving our. reserves.. The figure I presented to you last year is EUR1.5 billion. I have the pleasure to show you. it's still EUR1.5 million slight increase by EUR29 million to 1.546. But as we already indicated. and as Ulrich mentioned, we are at the ceiling. We are at the upper end of our yellow. range and our internal (dividend) threshold system. So we caught not again increased with. the same speed when we did in the past.. In the past, we contributed always around 3percentage points of our combined ratio to. the reserve buffer. This is -- this year it's only 0.4%. So it kept the level of reserve. redundancy stable. But it not increased it any further. And that's, as I mentioned, already. last year and the year before partially driven also by our auditors because that's the upper. end an auditor is going to accept.. These reserves are analyzed in different segments. And what we will give you the same. procedure as in the past, what we will give you is the full triangles of nine segments. It. starts with general liability non-proportional. Second is motor non-proportional. Third,. general liability proportional, then motor proportional, property proportional, property. non-proportional, marine, aviation. And last but not least credit and surety.. We will give you the triangle. And thus on the right-hand side of this slide, we will give you. the triangles for the underwriting years 2003 to 2014 that makes up EUR13.4 billion of. reserves. That doesn't mean that for the older underwriting years there are no reserves.. The opposite is true.. For the old underwriting years, that's the first column, 1979 to 2002, we have still EUR1.8. billion in reserves, EUR600 million coming from general liability non-proportional mainly. from the US casualty business. But here the reserves are more or less mature.. We know that we have long-lasting losses in the US casualty area, medical; med practice. professional liability are the staff, which take decades to be paid out in full. But here, the. volatility contributing to the ultimate expected loss ratio estimate is hollower than for the. more recent underwriting years that's 2003 to 2014. So we start.. In the triangles, we are delivering to you with 2003 going up to 2014. And this will then. cover 64.5%, two-thirds of our entire reserves.. The segments including the older underwriting years all together represent about threequarters of our gross carried reserves and that's exactly the figures thrown from our. database we are also using for our internal purposes. But as you may know it on a more. granular level.. Before now coming to the very detail aggregated slide as an example and as you know. would, I have to touch again on the data description and information. We are usually telling. you, which describes also the differences in our triangles to other peers.. Our data. And that the second bullet from the bottom, our data are on underwriting year. basis. That means the underwriting year has the same premium quality. So here, on an. underwriting year basis, we definitely know good years and bad years. And we have no. mixture in between.. If you do, as some peers are doing accident year estimates, you have one beauty. The. beauty is on an accident year triangle, the premium is fixed. The premium doesn't move.. But you have different premium parts. We have incoming premium parts from previous. years, which may have a different premium quality than the current year. And you have. outgoing parts, which are not contributing to the accident year but to the next accident. year where another premium quality also may dilute the full picture.. So here, we again have to state that we are convinced underwriting year triangles are. showing you that two are truth of the quality of the respective years. But the disadvantage. is that especially for the more recent years and for the most recent year you are lacking. the premium, which will then come in the next calendar year to complete the underwriting. years premium volume.. The data, the statistical gross reported loss triangles are based on cedants' original. advices that's mainly the paid and case reserve information in some cases will be. increasingly also getting IBNR estimates from cedants. But that's mainly on the. proportional side. On the non-proportional, it's still some sort of unusual that we get IBNR. estimates.. The figures in the triangles do not include business written at branch office and. subsidiaries because they have a different data level. Those branches and subsidiaries. then are reflected in the overall Towers Watson peer review. And the data; this also what I. should mention are combined triangles for the companies Hannover Re and E+S Re.. So -- and here we go. That's a nice slide, explaining the world on one slide.. On the left-hand side, you'll see the aggregated loss ratio development of the incurred. losses by underwriting year starting with underwriting year 2003 up to underwriting year. 2014. The first column is the expected or current status of the IFRS and premium, which. underlines my remark I made earlier on 2014. You will see only EUR2.8 billion whereas. 2013 already is EUR4.6 billion. That's due to the fact that a large portion of the premium. will be accounted for 2015.. On the right-hand side, the most interesting column is the first column. The first column is. the ultimate loss ratio as some sort of best estimate we are using for reserving purposes.. This ultimate expected loss ratio is drawn for the older underwriting years more or less. from actuarial assessments for the more recent underwriting years more as a mixture. between actuarial assessments and taking into account feedback from underwriters. regarding the quality of an underwriting year.. To say it very simple, if we have a loss ratio of 80%, which is our best estimate for the. underwriting year 2013. And we get messages from underwriters that the premiums are. dropping for the same exposure by 25%. So we have to reflect this in our reserving by. adjusting the loss ratio of 2014 to 100. That was just an example that did not happen. We. got the message from underwriters funny enough, that the quality of the 2014 year is. nearly the same for reserving purposes than the one-year developed 2013 year. You will. see it in the next slide.. But let's stay a couple of seconds on this slide. The second column, that's the paid losses. out of the premium. You'll see on the first column the paid losses so far for more mature. years like 2003 you'll see 42% of the premium was already paid. For the most recent. underwriting year 2013, only 12% out of the EUR2.8 billion premium is paid.. The second column from the right, the case reserve, that's what we get from our. cedants, the advices from cedants especially on case losses.. For the old underwriting year 2003, it's just 4.5percentage points. For the more recent. underwriting year 2014, it's 13.5%. It's not too much actually. So if we would not care about. IBNR at all, then our loss ratio would be 25%. But that's, of course, not the ( juices), we. have to apply techniques and methods to find out a best estimate of our ultimate loss. ratio for 2014. That's currently 79percentage points.. So when deducting from the 79percentage points, the 12percentage points already paid. and the 13percentage points notified by cedants, then you get this quite sizable amount. of more than a half, 53%, of the premium you have to set-up as IBNR. Then you have to. pray that this will last. In the past, it did.. On the bottom of this slide, we have shown this as figures. The left hand-side is simply. the development of the incurred loss percentages as graphs. On the right-hand side,. you'll see how the respective loss ratios are made up that the line on the right-hand side,. the gray line, is indicating the premium. And here you see the sharp drop from 2013 to. 2014 is nothing you have to be worried about. That's again the fact that the major part of. the premium will be accounted for next year.. On the other hand, on 2014, the green bar, you'll see the tremendous percentage, which. is set-up as IBNR.. Coming to my last slide, to leave Andreas and have room for his words, the last slide is. exactly touching on what I got as feedback from you a couple of times. What did I tell you?. Last year, what did I tell you? Five years ago, how does it compare over time?. For the underwriting years 2003 to 2014, you will see here what did I tell you 2008 as. being our best estimate of ultimate loss ratio. What did I tell you 2009 up to 2013?. And usually, usually it's dropping over time because we've started with a certain. conservatism of these 3percentage points in the reserves. And then it's released over. time.. Typical year for this is 2004 where we started with 66.9%, then we had a slight drop to. 65.8%, 65.1% , 63.8%, 62.8%, 62.6%. And now 61.1%. So that's a release meanwhile of. 5.8percentage points.. We have different developments. One of the examples, 2010, where it increased from. 81.2% to 84.1%. One of the reasons is very simple. This is an underwriting year triangle.. And for the Japanese earthquake, with the renewal season in Japan starting from first of. April and the Japanese earthquake being an event in March, it contributes to underwriting. year 2010 because it was not already renewed for 2011.. So here, we got as a first indication that we should increase our loss estimate a little bit.. So our initial expected loss ratio for 2010, underwriting year 2010 increased by. 3percentage points from 81% to 84%.. Fortunately enough, meanwhile we found out the Japanese earthquake was very. conservatively reserved after our first indications. So the loss ratio dropped again to. 81.4%, 78.9%. And now it's again at 80%. I think that's Newcastle, isn't it a little bit?. But you'll see here you have some volatility. It's not just going straight down, it's going up. and down.. The beauty is -- and that's now my last remark, the beauty is when looking at our current. ultimate expected loss ratios for the underwriting years 2010, 2011, 2012, '13. And '14, it's. within one percentage point range of 80%. That's exactly how I started 23 years ago. when we did our first late loss estimation systems. Our default value was a loss ratio of. 80%. Isn't this amazing? So let's keep fingers crossed that this will last when Andreas will. give the presentation on this next year.. So I stop it here. Thank you for this so far. And I will hand over to Andreas for the capital. model presentation.. Andreas Maerkert. So thank you, Eberhard, for handing over.. Thank you, Karl, for the nice introduction. And hello from my side to this audience. It's a. pleasure for me to be here for the first time.. And I think Eberhard mentioned it is not the exciting part that he has had to present. But. the building can be something that is quite exciting as well.. For me, one of the exciting elements working for Hannover Re is that we have to adopt. the changing environments in the market. This is a regulatory environment on a. continuous basis. So it's quite an exciting place. And we try to do that by maintaining a. flexible organization structure that can respond to these changes that we observe every. year in a flexible way and in a concise way. And this slide shows you our risk management. organization and how it's embedded in our true line of defense model.. We put the chance of Solvency II to restructure some elements over the past years and. also, of course, have to fulfill Solvency II two requirements. So those were Solvency II has. been a big topic for us in the past year.. As an example, we combined all the existent tasks, the actuarial tasks under the roof of. an actuarial function in our Group Risk Management department, which is of the. quantitative controlling department of the Hannover Re group, responsible for all the. models that we're are looking at in net cap pricing and also the internal model and, of. course, the reserving metrics.. Hannover Re maintains a comfortable capital position over the years. So this is also. nothing new from last year. We have relative to our internal target of Value at Risk 99.97%. capitalization. So what can be seen as a 3,000-year event at the Q4 2014, 160%. overcapitalization at that level so quite comfortable level. Also, sort of all of our peers that. rate us in some way or assess our capital position provided a consistent view on the. capitalization of Hannover Re.. Like the Solvency II notional capital requirements are fulfilled in a comfortable way for us. and also our ratings maintain or confirm the stable outlooks this year.. Apart from our capital level, which is, at the moment, probably hit higher than the longterm average or at the end of Q4 since renewing a period for hybrid capital has had a. very significant hybrid level at the end of Q4. But apart from the capital level, we also. control the operational volatility or the earning volatility and it is reflected by our wish to. maintain them.. A probability of negative earnings of less than 10%, currently the probability is 4.1% or. 4.6% depending on we look at before or after tax figures. And this also reflects our. reserving confidence level that can be used to steer this other earnings volatility.. Even the Solvency II coming into place, it's still the rating agency capital requirements that. are the driving force. Our capital level is geared to the maximum of all the requirements. that we face. So there's other requirements from rating agencies, from the regulators.. And Solvency II is one of this. And also relative to our internal targets.. And this illustrative picture shows the current situations a rating capital maintains to be the. maximum. And so this is even if Solvency II comes into force, no charge from sort of. previous situations. And it's also a result of getting the internal model approved under. Solvency II. Solvency II will not form a strong capital constraint to our business.. We have; I will come to that a bit later some benefits from approving an internal model. under Solvency II, which are quite significant compared to the standard formula. And we. have also some recognition of the internal model by rating agencies. So there is a. willingness of external parties to look at our internal risk assessment. And when we. provide enough reasoning, those external parties are accepting our internal risk. assessment and include this in their assessment.. However, you see that under S&P, that's -- or under the rating agencies I just can -- from. our perspective the only starting point and we hope that because of Solvency II, we'll be. driving forward for bringing interim models in a more permanent role because they. provide the real risk figures and not sort of a standardized template which wouldn't fit the. reinsurance business model.. As Eberhard mentioned and also Ulrich Wallin, we will see the required surprise. I'm happy. that we have reached the internal model approval so early this year although we entered. this Solvency II application process quite early in 2008. We still thought that the regulators",20151014_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Guidance_Call_2015-10-14_SD000000002902412998.pdf,2015-10-14
18,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome you to today's Hannover Re. International Conference Call on the Q3 2019 Results. For your information, this. conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Jean-Jacques. Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me also welcome you to our conference call,. presenting our results for the first nine months of this year. As usual, I will start with a short. summary, before our CFO, Roland Vogel will go over the financials in detail. For the Q&A,. I'm additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.. In the first nine months of 2019, Group net income increased by 38% to EUR1 billion. This is. particularly pleasing because it outperforms the top line growth and the increase of the. shareholders' equity and hence contributes to the ROE. On the basis of the favorable. underlying business development, this strong result is also supported by some nonrecurring effects, resulting from valuation gains from two participations.. One of them, Viridium was reported already in Q2, and contributed to our net income. with EUR100 million. The second gain results from the sale of a Nordic managing agent. which we founded in 2010 together with partners. We sold our stake in Q3, producing a. gain of EUR49 million. Gross premium increased by 13.3% adjusted for currency effects,. reflecting a healthy demand for reinsurance and for Hannover Re as a business partner.. Very strong investment income and the significantly improved earnings contribution from. our life and health business group, led group net income to rise to EUR1 billion. The. positive development in life and health reflected among other things, the actions taken in. the previous year to improve profitability in the US mortality business.. Despite the strong increase in shareholders' equity, the return on equity of 13.7%. remained clearly above our minimum target. Book value per share advanced to a new. record level of EUR88.97. The solvency ratio continues to be well above our 200%. threshold, standing at 245% at the end of the second quarter. This number should have. decreased in the third quarter, in line with the outlook presented at our Investors Day two. weeks ago.. Premiums in our P&C reinsurance business continued to grow strongly. The key impetus. for growth derived from North America, Asia and Germany as well as from structured. reinsurance. Despite the fact that with Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and the Thomas. Cook bankruptcy, we recorded sizable large losses in the third quarter. The overall large. loss experience was still below the expected levels on a nine month basis.. Due to our conservative reserving policy, in particular, with regard to our large loss. budget, this is largely not reflected in the underwriting results. On the other hand, our. results do include around EUR100 million in loss creep from Typhoon Jebi. Against this. backdrop, the underlying combined ratio is still more favorable than the reported 98.6%.. In life and health reinsurance, we saw good opportunities for new business in Asia,. resulting in gross premium growth of 5.8%, adjusted for currency effects.. The underwriting result improved, compared to the previous year, where we had. reported higher recapture charges for our US mortality business in the third quarter. Apart. from some negative developments in Australia and the UK, in the first half of the year, the. underwriting profitability was actually favorable. Our financial solutions business, again. contributed strongly to the results, and altogether EBIT for our life and health business. unit increased significantly to EUR478 million. The performance of our investments was. highly satisfactory. Assets under management grew to more than EUR47 billion, helped by. the positive cash flow and valuation changes.. The return on investment from assets under managements were 3.5% on an annual basis. and therefore, well above our target of 2.8%. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Roland. who will explain these figures in more detail.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Thank you Jean-Jacques, and good morning to everybody. As usual, I will walk you. through the financials in a bit more detail and try to keep my comments brief. We. recorded strong premium growth in the first nine months of 2019. Adjusted for currency. effects, gross premium written increased by 13.3%.. The strong contribution from our P&C business continued to be the major driver, but also. the business production of our life and health business group contributed as expected.. The difference between gross and net premium can be explained by the change in. unearned premium in a growing environment.. This effect however has already decreased compared to the first and second quarter. because we earned more of the premium over the course of the year. Other income, we. expect in other income and expenses improved due to a further increase in the. contribution from deposited accounted financial solutions contracts, but also from an. additional one-off, as we had sold our holding in a Swedish agency, which we had. consolidated before, as such, the mid double-digit profit is to be reflected here, rather. than as part of our investment results.. Currency effects had a minor positive impact in the first nine months, and at 20% tax rate. is below the expected level. This is driven by tax privileged investment gains. So,. altogether, group net income decreased by an impressive 38% to more than EUR1 billion. and with that to an all-time high in the first quarter -- in the third quarter.. On the next slide, the slide, the operating cash flow was very strong in the first nine. months, already exceeding with a number of the full year 2018. The main driver here is. the growth of our P&C business, and on top of this increasing valuation reserves and. currency effects, supported the growth in assets by around EUR1.8 billion and EUR1.3. billion respectively. Overall, assets under our management are at another record high. level of nearly EUR48 billion. By the way, as we have issued our new hybrid bond of. EUR750 million on October 1, this will only be reflected as from Q4 onwards.. Looking at the capital position, we see nearly the same effects. The strong earnings. comfortably exceed the dividend payment in Q2. And on top of this, the increase in OCI. boosts shareholders' equity to another record high of EUR10.7 billion, mainly driven by the. variation change due to decreased interest rates and lower credit spreads.. The composition of the total capital on the left hand side is unchanged, as just mentioned. also here the new bond is not yet included in the numbers and we'll at least temporarily. increase the hybrid capital by EUR750 million at year-end. However, there is a EUR500. million bond with the first call date in mid-2020 and in this regard, we have the. opportunity to potentially refinance this early. It was a very attractive coupon of 1.125%. comparing quite favorably to 5.75% for the old one.. On page -- or on slide number 8, P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 17.5% on. a currency-adjusted basis. This is driven by both our structured reinsurance and by. diversified growth in the traditional book across regions and lines of business across the. world. After a very benign first half quarter, major loss activity increased significantly in the. third quarter, however it was 5.9% of net premium income, major losses were still around. EUR120 million below budget. On a nine months basis, as in previous years, we stuck to. our reserving practice and reflected the large loss expectation as part of our IBNR. reserves.. The run-off result for the first nine months was overall positive, as expected, but still. includes the negative development of Typhoon Jebi for which we had increased our loss. estimates by around EUR100 million, compared to the year-end 2018 number. We will see. in a minute that two of our Q3 large losses have their impact nearly gross for net, and. especially for the EUR112 million credit loss, it is quite challenging to go forward, the large. loss budget.. Overall, we should have reserved more conservatively than last year, and today we. assume that the confidence level, at least, should not have deteriorated. Taking into. consideration, the positive results in life and health and from the investment side, the loss. development over the fourth quarter will determine what confidence level we are able to. achieve by year-end.. Altogether, we have to acknowledge that we missed our 97% combined ratio target in. Q3. Still, the result in P&C is satisfactory or even very satisfactory. Net investment income. increased slightly, driven by the favorable increase in ordinary investment income, other. income and expenses include the already mentioned EUR49 million gain from the. disposal of our participation. Apart from this, there are no other material one-offs included. in this line.. The tax ratio is slightly lower than normal. This is due to the just management disposal. gains and some realized gains from real estate in the third quarter, and both of these. effects enjoy a privileged tax treatment. On a 9 month basis, major losses were still below. the expected level, entirely driven by the very benign first half year. This means that, we. started the fourth quarter with around -- with the budget of around EUR330 million. including the roughly EUR120 million of unused budget carried forward.. I say it started because with Typhoon Jebi, we already observed another significant cat. event in October. It is still too early to come up with a loss number for our account.. However, based on the estimates from [ph] ARR for instance, the insured market loss. might reach a similar level as Typhoon Jebi which was a EUR230 million net loss for. Hannover Re. This means that the unused budget from the first half year is most likely no. longer available anymore as of today, but the overall budget available after three months'. should be more than sufficient to cover this loss. Looking at the large loss list in detail. here, you can see that the three events were the main driver for the exceptional high loss. burden in Q3.. Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and the Thomas Cook insolvency, particularly the EUR186. million net loss from Hurricane Dorian might be surprisingly high and you might also. wonder why the difference between gross and net is so small.. Firstly, we already had a higher market share in the Caribbean as for instance, compared. to Florida plus we took opportunities of improved market conditions after Hurricane Maria. in 2017, especially also writing proportional business. And secondly, the Caribbean. hurricane is not one of our defined peak net cat exposures, and therefore not covered by. our cat quota share.. The same is true for credit and surety business, where we are one of the market leaders. and hence we also take the Thomas Cook event gross for net. By the way, Jebi. developed slightly favorably in Q3. So, the runoff is still around the already mentioned. EUR100 million year-to-date, but at least the direction of development has turned.. Those three large loss events are also visible in the technical profitability, by line of. business leading to combined ratios above target in North America, in credit and surety. and then the Cat XL line. Cat XL, additionally includes the negative runoff of Jebi as. already mentioned.. The combined ratio for UK, Ireland and the London market also exceeds the target. affected by rather weak technical profitability of the Lloyd's business that we support.. On the other hand, aviation, marine are significantly below target benefiting from a. favorable loss experience as well as some positive reserve runoffs. And also, then. Germany and Latin America contributed well to the technical results.. In life and health on the next slide, gross written premium increased by 5.8% on an. adjusted -- FX adjusted basis, new business production was particularly favorable in Asia,. and here again with a focus in China. The results for our US mortality business improved. significantly because we had booked EUR218 million of recapture charges in Q3 2018.. Moreover, the underlying mortality in the first nine months was better than expected, and. that particularly in the third quarter. As already reported with our half-year results, we had. some negative effects from disability business in Australia and we had added some. reserves for our UK business in both cases, we have not seen a material further negative. development in the third quarter.. Already, the ordinary investment income increased compared to the previous years, but. also the fair value changes through P&L were beneficial in the first nine months of 2018 as. part of the realized gains. We accounted for the one-off of EUR100 million and that. altogether boosted the net investment income to EUR414 million. Other income expense. -- other income and expenses are mainly driven by an even increased contribution from. financial solutions business, particularly in the US, for which a large portion is recognized,. according to the deposit accounting method.. Altogether, based on the EBITDA, EUR478 million, we are very well on track to maybe. even outperform the guidance of EUR400 million, excluding the EUR100 million one-off. here, again worth to mention at 15%, the tax ratio is below the normal level, driven again. by the tax privileged valuation gains. We and especially I were very satisfied with the. development of our investments in the first nine-months, return on investment of 3.5% is. remarkably above our initial expectation for the full year with increased ordinary. investment income to the already good figures in the previous years. If we adjust the. 3.5% for the Viridium effect, that would still be 3.2% or more than 3.2%.. Realized gains were largely driven by the disposal of another real estate object in the. third quarter that contributed another EUR50 million, after EUR20 million in the first. quarter, the change in fair value -- our financial instruments was positive on top. The. ModCo derivative contributed EUR6 million. Unrealized gains, increased significantly to a. record high again, mainly driven by our fixed income portfolio due to the decreasing. yields in the major currencies as well as lower credit spreads, so that unrealized valuation. stood at EUR2.8 billion has gained a lot of liquidity here.. On the next slide, you can see that we did not change our asset allocation during the. year, at least not on an asset class level, as just recently explained at our Investors Day,. we are improving our geographical diversification of our fixed income portfolio, mainly by. increasing the investments, also in emerging markets, where yields are still a bit more. attractive. The overall diversified contribution to ordinary income is again supported by. the good results from real estate and private equity, but not to any extraordinary extent.. I think this concludes my remarks, and I'll leave the target matrix and the outlook to you,. Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much Roland. On slide 17, the target matrix reflects the overall good. performance of our business in the nine months of this year. Roland explained the. reasons for the small miss on two of the profitability targets in P&C, but I have to consider. like him, the overall profitability of our P&C portfolio as healthy.. On slide 19, this brings us to the updated outlook for the year 2019, reflecting the. favorable business development in the first nine months. We have raised our targets for. premium growth and investment returns. For the group net income, we are now targeting. to achieve more than EUR1.25 billion, but the message regarding the dividends remains. unchanged. If our capitalization remains at a comfortable level as planned, we will again. pay a special dividend for the year 2019.. Overall, the previous year's total dividend of EUR5.25 per share should serve as a. minimum benchmark for this year's dividend. Looking at the expectation for our P&C. business, you can see many arrows pointing upwards confirming the favorable demand. for reinsurance. The overall financial year profitability is also satisfactory enabling us to. earn our cost of capital, so somewhat weaker profitability in Cat XL, which is obviously. affected by large losses as well as UK, Ireland and the London market will be offset by. positive developments in other areas. In life and health reinsurance, the expected growth. is somewhat more modest compared to P&C, and we will see good opportunities for. further growth in morbidity business, mainly in Asia while demand for financial solutions. also remains strong.. With regards to the financial solutions business, the arrow is not reflecting this. development, because a significant part of the business is booked according to the. deposit accounting method, and hence not visible in the premium.. Looking at the profitability, all the individual lines are expected to earn the cost of capital. or more. Profitability is particularly strong in financial solutions, where our US business is. the main driver. Longevity is also enjoying a healthy performance and altogether the result. is expected to increase steadily, driven by the improved results from our US mortality. business due to the in-force management actions and the associated one-off IFRS. charges taken in 2018.. Finally, we come to the group outlook for the year 2020. Based on a continued. competitive, but improving market environment in property and casualty reinsurance and. our good market position in life and health reinsurance, we expect to grow our premium. by around 5% adjusted for currency effects.. At the occasion of our Investors Day, Roland gave an update on our investment portfolio. and the impact from the continued very low yields and hence it should not come as a. surprise that our ROI targets is 10 basis points below the initial target for 2019 at around. 2.7%.. Altogether, we anticipate group net income of roughly EUR1.2 billion compared to the. guidance for 2019, this is an underlying increase of around EUR100 million. We're also. raising our net major loss budget for the 2020 financial year to EUR975 million. The. increase in the budget is motivated primarily by the continued expansion of our underlying. business, the risk appetite on the underwriting side has not changed materially. Finally, our. approach to capital management is unchanged and I'd expect us to be in a position to. again pay a special dividend in order to pave the way for attractive ROE in the future.. As you can see, from the guidance and from our messages today and at our recent. Investors Day, we are optimistic about the outlook for the industry and for Hannover Re, in. particular. We do see an increasing demand for reinsurance with -- at the same time,. improving pricing trend worldwide. We're well positioned to benefit from this market. momentum and therefore expect to deliver attractive returns in the future.. On that note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation and look. forward to your questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) First question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open, please go. ahead.. Kamran Hossain. All right. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one is just on the major loss. budget. Thanks for the color that you've given around increasing that to EUR975 million. from EUR875 million. Could you maybe explain in a little bit more detail, where kind of you. expect your additional exposures come from? I guess you're aiming for top line growth of. 5% major loss budget going up 11% and it already feels like you're relatively cautious in. assessing that number. So, any color on kind of where you see the additional major loss. and cat exposure coming from?. And the second question is on Life Re. I think the underlying, even if you back out some of. the real estate gains, feels like it's running above your kind of EUR450 million-ish target. I. mean, could you give us an idea of what you think the underlying is for the quarter and. then maybe what you think or how we should think about this going forward into future. years. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Well, good morning. This is Sven Althoff. I will take the major loss budget question. As. Roland has explained, when he talked about the growth in 2019, we do expect a similar. picture in 2020 i.e. diversified growth from a peril point of view. So, we expect the. increase in the major loss budget being driven more or less proportionately in line with. that premium growth, in all of the peak peril scenarios, given that our growth is also. covering many of the peak peril scenario. So the Asia, North America and Australia will all. feature the growth pattern, so there is not a particular area where the increase in major. loss budget will come from, but more organic proportional growth.. Roland Helmut Vogel. If I may add to that, this is Roland. You have to bear in mind that we set our large loss. budget early in the year based on the plan, we had more than expected growth in 2019.. So, in that respect the increase which we now have in 2020 also includes a little bit of the. out performance of 2019 and does not reflect an increased risk appetite as we. mentioned before, but it reflects the overall growth we see.. Kamran Hossain. Makes sense. Thanks very much.. Sven Althoff. Maybe on the (inaudible) on the life side. Of course, this year is quite pleasing, especially. with the additional real estate of participation profit. The run rate, we would expect should. be under normal circumstances, well above the EUR400 million. So this means for 2019,. well above the EUR500 million more probably EUR450 million in the long run.. The only issue is that we had very positive variation in 2019 on the mortality claims side. and we are still not certain whether this is the trend or will be seen in the future as well.. This is why we are still guiding a little bit carefully here.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks.. Operator. The next question is from James Shuck, Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.. James Shuck. Hello, good morning. First question is around the growth rate in P&C Re. So, the GWP. growth at nine months was 18% constant currency. I think the renewal July year-to-date. was plus 15% at the renewal time, you didn't mention structured products as a source of. that growth, but for the GWP growth today, you mentioned structured products along with. Asia and along with North America.. Could you just help identify what the contribution is from structured products, both on. renewals and on the GWP at the 9 months, please. Second question was around US. casualty reserving. It's difficult to get insight into what your size of US reserves are on. casualty. In particular, the split between proportional and excess of loss; if you're able to. give any insight into the mix of your reserves, particularly from US casualty in those two. areas and just comment around some of the trends you've seen year-to-date in 2019.. I'm particularly interested in some of the well telegraphs kind of social inflation trends that. we've seen, and how that's filtering through into the US excess of loss book, please.. And finally, just a quick one, I didn't see a combined ratio target or guidance for 2020. I. think you do normally give one for the year ahead, you expect that to be flat on the 97%. or maybe a bit better? Thank you.. Roland Helmut Vogel. So, maybe I can take the first one, James, because it will be in line with the previous. guidance 97% -- better than 97% combined ratio.. James Shuck. Yeah.. Roland Helmut Vogel. I think with regard to casualty -- US casualty, we don't have the numbers or the detailed. numbers of excess of loss to proportional and where it comes from. I think in general, I. think when we have received the question before about our exposures here, especially. when it comes to the opioid crisis or other components, I think we had a look at our. reserves in US casualty, especially we are well reserved. This is where we have the most. part of our redundancies. So, we also looked at these trends and have not seen any. reason to assume that this comfortable position, we are in today is changing.. Sven Althoff. between EUR350 million of growth for this year, and the reason why we have not. reported this during our call on the 1-1 renewals is twofold. First, we never talk about. advanced solutions, we knew that's a focus area and that will -- and secondly managed. solutions contracts are only concluded after January 1 so, later in the year because they. are not so 1/1 sensitive. It's quite alright, given the structure of those contracts to continue. negotiating a month or so into the New Year and then have the effective stage -- at 1/1 or. at a later stage, so that's why it didn't feature that prominently when we talked about 1/1. renewals.. James Shuck. I was looking at the July year-to-date renewals actually, which was plus 15%. I'm wondering. how much of that comes from structured and tailored transactions?. Roland Helmut Vogel. I think, we mentioned at the half year results that we had it approximately 50-50. The. growth -- after the nine months was a little bit more prominent -- or the contribution was a. little bit more prominent from the traditional reinsurance side, and a little bit less, so from. advanced solutions because that was very strong in the first half year.. James Shuck. Okay, that was great, thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open, please go. ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you very much. Just one numbers question and one probably volume question. On. the numbers, the AUM is interesting nearly EUR3 billion growth from EUR45 billion to. EUR48 billion in this three months window, so we're in 3Q standalone. I mean, the. operating cash flow is around EUR940 million on the slide, the fixed income growth is. around -- I mean, the unrealized gains are around EUR0.5 billion.. Is there a significant mark-up to in private equity or somewhere else, which explains. almost a EUR1.5 billion delta between these two items and the AUM growth please and. sorry if you would like to take it offline, but I just thought I'd ask this question.. And second thing was more on the guidance on volume, the 5% -- I mean last -- I think. two years, the guidance has been beaten on volume. And also -- just to clarify, I mean the. 5% you mentioned is a composite of pretty strong growth in P&C and modest in life. And. is there anything other than that, if it's that you think structured is slowing down or is there. something else or if that's really it and sorry last, if I may, the 2019 guidance and. comments around fourth quarter have no mention obviously around California wildfire. which is still very early, I presume but would that change some of this guidance for 2019?. Just a comment would help. Thank you.. Roland Helmut Vogel. So, if I start with the AUM Vinit, I think if you -- for instance, at the presentation there is. some guidance in the components, but I think you have already referred to the EUR1.8. million development of unrealized gains and that is really the fixed income portfolio. I think. these are really as I -- this is why I also mentioned, the increased liquidity by the beginning. of the year.. equity and real estate and what came on top of that was driven by the regular fixed. income book, and here of course by the decreasing interest rates and the decreasing. credit spreads as mentioned. So, there was no extraordinary development from the more. illiquid asset classes.. Maybe on the year, the guidance question. The guidance is of course driven by the fact. that we see some momentum in the P&C market, but at the same time, we expect the. market to be very competitive and therefore we felt we should not be too aggressive on. top line growth, quality is the name of the game and that led to the 5%, slightly more on. the P&C side than life and health. But, there is no link with California wildfire in particular,. you mentioned, this is not related to the plan.. On California wildfires when -- a bit more but, of course too early to say, but we would not. expect a repeat of what happened at the previous years. This is expected to be much. lower in comparison in terms of exposure for Hannover Re.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay, thank you.. Sven Althoff. To confirm that, of course we are very closely observing the various fires, we are talking. more than half a dozen of fires right now. When we look at the structures that have been. destroyed so far, they are at a relatively low level compared to the wildfire events in 2017. and 2018. So, none of those fires at this stage, give us particularly concern that they will. develop into a major loss for us. But it's early days. I mean, given the very, very dry. weather conditions and soil conditions in California right now, it can change overnight with. the change in wind speeds and wind direction. So, it's too early to give a final assessment. on the ongoing fire.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you. And can I assume that even if -- I mean at the moment, you're EUR1.25 billion. greater than EUR1.25 billion for 2019, assuming California fires are as they are and you. Roland Helmut Vogel. We don't have any losses related to California wildfire at this stage. The number does not. Sven Althoff. with the remaining budget of EUR330 million. If we assume that some of that is digested. wildfire in the size of the last year. If of course, large losses accumulate in Q4, and it's only. the beginning of November today, then I think we would take to our usual guidance that, if. we exceed the large loss budget remarkably that could have an impact on the year-end. result. But today, we see that there is still room for more losses in the large loss budget.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you very much for the clarification. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Farooq Hanif, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, please go. ahead.. Farooq Hanif. Hi everybody. Thank you very much. I just wanted to return to US casualty. What's your kind. of explanation for the sort of double message that we're gathering. So, the US primary. carriers really seem to be extremely worried about, medical malpractice and whole variety. of latent claims. But, a lot of the re-insurers, and to yourselves, it seems to be very well. active, is that because you feel like you've been taking very conservative loss picks. already, and you've anticipated. Do you think there is an element of delay in reporting. I. mean, what more can you say on that?. Second question is on the large loss budget and the increase of it. You seem to be talking. about proportional increase with volume growth that you've had, yet to take. But I would. have thought that with the pricing that we're seeing, you'd be more than compensated. for that. So, I just wondered to what extent you are just being kind of conservative there.. Sven Althoff. Okay. I will take the US casualty question. I wouldn't say that we are relaxed would be the. right expression. I would say we feel that we are prudently reserved, given our ultimate. loss ratio picks, of course, there is a number of complex -- the US casualty situations,. which we are currently observing. So, Roland mentioned the opioids, that there was. concussion claims, there is the lifting of the time barring on old sexual molestation loss. situation, so we are observing that all very closely, and for some of those situations we. have also decided to book additional reserves over and above our initial loss ratio peaks.. So, from that perspective, there is a lot of development, but at this stage, we are. comfortable with our overall and aggregated loss reserving on the US casualty.. Roland Helmut Vogel. And to come back on the large loss budget one more time. Yes, we are expecting better. prices, still I think we also have been commenting on that more than once that overall, we. see that various -- various areas are still not in an area where we would increase our. writings drastically. In that regard, if there are really opportunities arising we will be able to. take them on. But we are not expecting our risk appetite on the Cat XL increasing, so. remarkably that this would justify an even higher increase of the large loss budget here.. Farooq Hanif. Thank you very much. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Sami Taipalus of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Sami Taipalus. You mentioned, underlying profit increase of about EUR100 million from the EUR1.1 billion. to the initial guidance to the EUR1.2 billion guidance, but if I look at the sort of top line. development in P&C, which is maybe 20% year-on-year and the strong development in. the life and health reinsurance profit over the year. It seems like that's quite low. I'm. struggling to reconcile the moving parts a little bit. Is there something else there that I. should bear in mind when you're thinking about rolling this guidance forward to 2020?. Then my second question just comes back to your view on the market a little bit, if I look. at Cat XL and the London market business and you're basically stating a reasonably. negative view in your communication there. Is that just related to the loss experience. you're currently seeing or is that a comment on what you see the rate efficacy being in. the market at the moment? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, I think to come back to the latter question, this is really a reflection of the current. result, this is not a reflection of the market. So, these arrows on the slide is a reflection of. the current result and not of our market. With regards to the guidance, I can also add that. of course, the assumption on the investment side is nearly entirely based on ordinary. investment income. So, the -- and this is why we go down to 2.7% up to now, we have had. a little bit of a positive impact every year, but again in our plan, extraordinary gains are not. included to a material extent so that really is based on ordinary investment income and. the decrease from 3.5% to 2.7% in ROI that would not be easily compensated by. additional volumes.. So, there is at least in our plan the investment income goes down and you have. mentioned the positive components of our plan and in this regard, you might consider. that as being conservative, but again it is late 2019, and we'd rather outperform the. guidance than underperform.. Sami Taipalus. Sorry, just to interject, did the initial EUR1.1 billion guidance for 2019 include an investment. return of 3.5% or assume an investment return of 3.5%?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I think, you're right, but it was higher and it did include more extraordinary investment. gains than -- and the 2020 plan.. Sami Taipalus. Okay, okay, cool. Great, thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Andreas Schafer, Bankhaus Lampe. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Thank you. Just one question regarding your guidance for 2019 with a combined ratio of. still 97% after having reached 98.6% after Q3, so that implies let's say a combined ratio of. to reach the sort of combined ratio, even if you have, let's say, larger claims like the. Typhoon and Californian wildfires that seems to be still very, let's say, optimistic in my. view.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes, thank you for the question. And, I will try to explain that and we've mentioned that. the Q3 reserving exercise that there was really no reason to be very aggressive. Overall,. we mentioned that reserving was more conservative than it was last year. And, in that. regard there could be -- there is a little buffer for Q4 included today and even more so. and as we mentioned before, if we really get higher than expected, we would also use. the flexibility we have, but this is not anticipated as of yet.. And of course the large loss budget is included in the numbers year-to-date, which partly. explains why the numbers will normalize to some extent by the end of the year.. Andreas Schaf er. Okay, thanks a lot.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning everyone. Just two question on my side related to the life and health. reinsurance. The first one will be related to the US financial solutions. So, year-to-date,. we've got a 46% increase to EUR211 million. Could you help us to better understand how. the growth in the US financial solution, EBIT contribution is going to trend into 2020. It's. been a significant growth and gradual cut quarterly improvement, but how should we. expect this 46% to go into 2020. And the second question would be related as well to. the life and health, just a clarification. So, is your EUR1.2 billion net income for 2020 based. on a EUR450 million EBIT profit for the life business? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Thomas, let's start with the financial solutions. We have to admit that the 40% margin. here is not a good measure, because we have to summarize all the business we have on. financing, to financial solutions to solvency deal, under its reporting category. In absolute. terms, we expect the profitability to continue and even grow in 2020. Whether this is a. 40% margin or not depends on how many treaties have to be booked according to FAS. 113, that means the purchase accounting. So, please don't try to interpret increases of. these EBIT margins here. But, the profitability will continue and we expect that there will. be a significant growth also in the mid term over the next couple of years.. Roland Helmut Vogel. With regards for the 2020 plan Thomas, you are right that plan includes a little bit more. than the EUR400 million, but not much more. Does that answer your question?. Thomas Fossard. Yeah, thanks, Roland. Thanks.. Operator. The next question is from Vikram Gandhi, Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I apologize at the onset, in case I'm are asking. something that you've already mentioned in your opening remarks, because I joined the. call late. So, my first question is based on the movement in the reported combined ratios. runoff results. Is that a fair conclusion? Can you offer some insights on what's happening. with the runoff result this year. I mean, at least till the 9 months and since even net of the. loss creep on Typhoon Jebi, I guess the runoff results seem to be slowing down year-onyear and that's question one.. Secondly, what are your assumptions on the industry-wide losses from Dorian and. Typhoon Faxai. And thirdly, on the 2020 guidance, you've got a 5% premium growth. overall and you said, a bit more on the P&C side, 97% or less combined; you've got. confidence on your US financial solutions; US mortality book should behave better, and yet. you say the EBIT assumption or -- and what you pencil in for FY 2020 is a bit more than. EUR400 million, but not significantly more than EUR400 million and that's a bit of a. surprise and then overall, EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion net income increase also seems to. be a bit conservative. So, any thoughts there would be really helpful. Thank you.. Roland Helmut Vogel. So Vikram, if I start with the run off; I did mention it in my presentation that we had a. regular run off result which does include Jebi. So, it was a little bit lower than the regular,. but other than that, we did not have any extraordinary effect. I would also not subscribe to. your proposal that the run-off result goes down year-by-year, if I look at the numbers, we. have been publishing and I always mention that you have to take them with a grain of salt,. because there could be one-offs into them.. So, in that regard, we do not see that the run-off result is slowing down, and as long as. the redundancies on a comparable level that should not be the case. I think that was -that was my question, if I -- the loss assumptions Sven, you will?. Sven Althoff. Yes, happy to take those. On both Dorian and Faxai, we have done bottom up estimates,. rather than taking a market loss as a starting point to better reflect the individual. exposure of our individual clients. But, if you want to translate that into a market loss, it's. on both -- somewhere between $5 billion and $7 billion. On Faxai, obviously completely -the Typhoon in Japan driven on Dorian, the bulk of the $5 billion to $7 billion is from the. Bahamas, this is a very limited contribution from the US part of that loss.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. So on the guidance, just back to our previous remarks, clearly you have one-offs this. year which make the growth in our net results for next year I would say realistic, it's not. that easy to beat. And we took account of the fact that there is growth momentum, there. is some potential for price adjustment in P&C. But, we are also well aware of the very. competitive market condition, if prices do improve materially that there will be also more. capital entering the system. And for that reason, we didn't want to be too aggressive on. particularly on our top line guidance.. Roland Helmut Vogel. If I may add to that, that you should be aware that with our initial reservings, additional. premium in P&C does not immediately lead to a higher profitability in the first year,. because we very often book initial loss ratios higher than 100. So, it takes a little bit to. while until that growth really comes down to the bottom line and on top of that, if you call. us conservative, we don't take that as an offense.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay, that's great Roland. If I could just come back to the first point. And maybe, we can. take this discussion offline, if you want. The first-half 2019 combined ratio reported one is. 96.7% and the 9 month is 98.6%. So, nearly 2 percentage point increase just because of. the addition of one quarter and you still haven't exceeded your budget i.e., there is no. impact from excess large losses over your budget. So I'm struggling to understand what. can drive 2 percentage point increase in the combined ratio from first half of nine month.. If the reserve leases haven't or the run-off result hasn't been a lot lesser than what it used. to be. I think the attritional has weakened a bit maybe, I don't know.. Roland Helmut Vogel. I think there was also the underlying loss ratio was a little bit higher than compared to last. year. I also mentioned in my opening remarks that especially the credit loss -- for the. credit loss, it is challenging especially in a fourth quarter or by the end of the third quarter. when you have started your year-end proceedings to roll forward, the large loss budget in. one loss which only affects a single line, implying that we did not fully release the large. loss budget against that one credit loss, but again it's challenging to really see that in the. ultimate loss ratio picks, across the whole portfolio and moreover, we also indicated that. we had been a bit more conservative than last year.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. Thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from Roland Pfander, Oddo BHF. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Roland Pf ander. Yes, good morning two questions if I may on life reinsurance; firstly on longevity. If I. compare your profitability outlook compared to last year, it looks like you are a little bit. more optimistic now shooting for earning above cost of capital. Is there any specific. reason to this maybe you could explain on this point a little bit more in detail.. Secondly, mortality, could you give us a normalized EBIT margin for the new business you. are writing currently, also in the context of recent very favorable underwriting results here. in this business line. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Yes, let's start with the longevity, you might have seen that mortality got a little bit worse,. especially in the UK in the last couple of year, some of the direct writers have even. changed their assumption. We didn't do that, but of course we expect higher profits from. that -- on the longevity business, the longevity side.. Still, most of our longevity business is from the UK. We are writing a lot around the world. but still, most of that comes from the UK. So, we are a little bit more optimistic on that site. that you will see the profits coming through, slowly but constantly in the next couple of. years.. Then mortality EBIT varies a lot around the globe. We have different EBIT expectations for. different markets. If you look at the US, we are pricing for something, which is more like. 10% EBIT margin. If we finally make 8%, we will be happy. We don't drive much UK. business because EBIT margins would be insufficient from our point of view and in other. markets, it varies really by markets around the world. But everything is priced according to. the same return on equity, as we have on the P&C side that we have with all our business.. Roland Pf ander. But did it improve lately, mortality margins on the new business, it looks like at least?. Sven Althoff. Definitely, you see the results from the management actions in the US, but we don't see. mortality rates improving in general worldwide.. Roland Pf ander. Okay, thank you.. Sven Althoff. It is strong as ever.. Operator. Next question is from Michael Haid, Commerzbank. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Good morning to everyone. Two questions, first on the K session,. the K session does not apparently apply to the Bahamas. Still the Bahamas is North. Atlantic hurricane risk. Is there any reason why you treat the US differently than the. Bahamas, or is it just a constructional mistake that you intend to rectify in the future, first. question.. Second question pricing in Asia, property net cat, it appears to me that, given this high. losses from last year already, that the pricing in the April renewals was by far not sufficient.. Do you share this view and should we expect an acceleration of price increases in Asia for. the 2020 renewals?. Sven Althoff. Yes, thank you very much for those questions. Starting with the K question, why it's. Bahamas not included in K. As Roland already explained, when he talked about Dorian,. the bulk of our exposure in the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands in general that's. coming from proportional business and K only takes non-proportionate business. So, the. impact by including it into the K session at the time was a commercial decision whether. this would improve our expected return from the K transaction or not and that's the time. we came to the conclusion that it wouldn't. So, it was a conscious decision, it was not an. oversight. When it comes to the Japanese renewals and what do we expect on the next. renewals, following the run-off from Jebi and the two new Typhoon events. You are. certainly correct that as we -- had we known the full impact of Jebi i.e., the including the. development of the loss, which the entire market not only Hannover Re has observed in. 2019 then in all likelihood the price increases at this year's April 1 renewals would have. been more significant compared to what we could actually achieve.. Now, was that run-off plus the two new losses? Of course, we continue or we do expect. significant rate increases again whether they will be accelerated is a different question. because it's unfortunately not as simple as saying, you have to pay so much more for the. Jebi deterioration and then you have to pay more, because we have Faxai and our EBIT. one plus one does not necessarily make two, in that respect, when it comes to rate. increases and of course the client always has the option to discontinue buying low layer. structures, if they feel that the risk transfer they can achieve after additional rate increase. is sufficient.. So yes, you can expect significant rate increases. But we also have to be mindful that the. percentage increase on the absolute premium that we will be able to generate that will. be impacted by those risk transfer consideration by the Japanese client.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Fantastic.. Operator. The next question is from Emanuele Musio, Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Emanuele Musio. I have one question, given the strong pricing improvement in retro, and given pricing. improvements in reinsurance are lagging; I'm wondering whether this might have an. impact on your retrocession appetite and-or whether this might have an impact on your. cat budget, looking ahead? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Well, no intention to place similar retro structures compared to what we placed the last. couple of years. Of course, we have the financial flexibility that in case the retro market. charge increases, which is not in line with our view on the exposure of those particular. contracts, which we are buying to place less retrocession and we also have the flexibility. to increase over and above what we currently have in our plan for natural catastrophe. business, when it comes (inaudible) into us because we have certainly not exhausted our. potential risk appetite for natural catastrophe business.. I think we have taken a prudent view on what we can expect on further rate increases and. our plan is driven on that prudent view, if we should have been too pessimistic, we would. be able to take full advantage of the development and write more business.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Maybe one element to consider is, of course that the exposed markets have usually. renewals on April 1 and July 1 for North America, and that gives us ample time to prepare. for the renewals and have an appropriate strategy to link the price of the retro market,. with the pricing we will apply for the renewals. So, we remain confident from that. perspective as well.. Emanuele Musio. Okay, thank you.. Operator. And we have another question from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yeah, sorry, just a question on the surety loss on Thomas Cook. If we understand that's. not part of the K session, but still an individual loss on the credit and surety portfolio of. above EUR100 million is still a significant loss. And I'm pretty surprised that in fact there is. no specific retro protection in place to cap this single loss exposure. So, maybe could you. share a bit more how you're protecting your book in this business line? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Yes. Very happy to do that. Of course, loss of more than EUR100 million is a very. significant loss, you're absolutely right in that. But, it's fully in line with our risk appetite for. our specialty classes where we are expecting that from time to time. We will experience. three digit losses. We have looked into retrocessional solutions for credit and bond. business in the past, there are some products available, but it's -- we always came to the. same conclusion, the limits that are available are not really moving the meter for us. And. secondly, they come at very loaded pricing because it's such a tight market. So, therefore,. on the credit and bond side unlike marine and aviation where we buy substantially, we. always came to the conclusion that it would be much more beneficial for us to write less. gross exposure rather than the net position by what we felt is yeah too expensively priced. small retro solutions.. Thomas Fossard. Okay, thank you.. Roland Helmut Vogel. But to be very clear. I mean, a loss coming from that business practice of EUR110 million is. what we can fully expect from time to time.. Operator. And the next question is from Jonny Urwin, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.. Jonny Urwin. Hello, thanks. Just a quick one, please. Just to clarify, so what drove this additional. reserving conservatism during the quarter? Was there any specific lines, i.e., have you. increased loss picks on casualty like some of the US primaries are doing, or is it just. replenishing the buffers of some erosion in recent years. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Hi, it's, I would say -- it's a mixture of things you have to bear in mind that when we closed. the books, for Q3, we saw Hagibis already come in. So, in that respect and if you then -with the uncertainty around another big Japanese Typhoon plus a very positive. contribution from life and health and from the investment side, it did not really make. sense to be overly aggressive on the P&C reserving.. Jonny Urwin. Okay, thank you. I guess, the bearish read of that is the buffers have come down in the. last three years like potentially, i.e., are you not happy to see them fall further or is it just a. bit more opportunistic. It sounds like it's been more opportunistic than that, you've had a. good result in life, so you're going to take some of the benefits P&C reserves.. Sven Althoff. Again, not knowing how what Hagibis and the rest of the fourth quarter will bring to us. Of. course, with the very positive contribution from the other side, this could have been an. opportunity to fill the buffers again and increase those and we wanted to be prepared to. do that. And on the other hand, again with now the fourth quarter being open and seeing. how Hagibis is coming, we just wanted to make sure that we do not see a Jebi. development again.. Jonny Urwin. Okay, thank you. And you have increased loss picks on casualty?. Sven Althoff. Not that I'm aware of. We had, again I mentioned that before we had a close look, also. driven a little bit by more than one of the question from your community, our reserving. actuary is looked at it one more time. We see that the casualty reserves also rolling. forward a little bit from the older years, so there was no reason to take action based on. the information we have today.. Jonny Urwin. Thank you.. Operator. And we have a follow-up question from James Shuck, Citi. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. James Shuck. Sorry, I was on mute. Obviously, just very quickly. Sorry for the follow-up; the 98.6%. combined ratio, nine months. Now, the bank is in normal run rate for large losses. You've. intimated that the PYD for the nine months was broadly in line with previous years, subject. to the Jebi addition of about EUR100 million.. So, if I normalize for that kind of Jebi situation, then maybe you're running about EUR98. million. And really just a simple question is why is that EUR98 million rather than the low. EUR97 million because I think your answers around the casualty loss picks has not been. that the loss picks have been getting higher.. So, if you just help me understand why that's not running below EUR97 million on a kind of. look through basis that would be helpful. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. I think, I can only reiterate, I think what I said at the last one it was -- it was the -- to let the. credit loss kind of run-off against a budget was not easy to determine in the middle of a. late third quarter. We took a little bit -- a conservative position, especially on the cat. losses.. So, although the losses are in between the budget, it always depends on how much of",20191106_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2019-11-6_DN000000002738892338.pdf,2019-11-06
19,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Q1 2018 Results. For you information, this conference is being. recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich. Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. [0682QB-E Ulrich Wallin]. Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our. conference call presenting our results for the first quarter of 2018. As usual, I'm joined by. our CFO, Roland Vogel. Before we start, I'd like to extend my special thanks to all those. participating from the UK because you have a bank holiday today.. Unfortunately, we are bound with our Q1 conference call to the date of our AGM which. takes place today. Sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused. I'm pleased to be. able to report to you that our results for the first quarter of the year fully support our. guidance for 2018. We managed to substantially grow our business and our gross written. premium grew by 17.6% which equates to 27.5% at constant exchange rates.. This growth was mainly driven by a number of large transactions from our P&C business. group. As most of this business was written newly in the first quarter, it created a. significant and earned premium reserve and as a result the net premium earned. increased by only 7%. We are quite pleased that the EBIT grew by 8.5% which is. somewhat more pronounced than the growth of our net earned premium income which. we feel underlined the quality of the net earned premium growth.. The group net income only grew by 3.3% to €273 million. The lower growth of the group. net income compared to the EBIT growth is the result of the one-off tax burden due to. the reorganization of our U.S. Life & Health business following the U.S. tax reform which. was enacted at the end of last year. We are, however, not expecting any further negative. effects from the U.S. tax reform so that the tax rate of our Life & Health business should. normalize in the coming quarters.. At 13%, the return on equity remains well above our minimum target of 900 basis points. above the risk-free rate. Despite the fact that expressed in euros the book value per. share slightly reduced due to the further strengthening of the euro, in particular, against. the U.S. dollar, our solvency ratio remains comfortable at around 260%.. Our property-casualty reinsurance business in the first quarter saw a very dynamic growth. both for the bottom as well as for the top line. Considering our continued conservative. loss reserving policy, we are satisfied with the combined ratio of 95.9%, which meets our. respective target.. Also our life and health business had a very good first quarter, with an EBIT growth of. 6.9% to €96 million, driven in particular by our worldwide excluding U.S. business, as well. as by the U.S. financial solutions business. Our legacy U.S. mortality business, whilst. continued to be loss-making, developed better than we had expected following our. complete remodeling of that business towards the end of last year. The premium growth. amounted to 9.2% at constant exchange rate, which is well above our target.. I already commented on the one-off tax burden as a result of the U.S. tax reform. Once. again, our return on investment developed very favorable and came in at 3.3% on an. annualized basis for the assets under own management.. On this positive note, I would hand over to Roland, who will explain to you these figures in. more detail.. Roland Vogel. Good morning. Thank you, Uli. I'll try to keep positive and I should be able to keep my. comments brief, as the Q1 2018 results do not include too many material one-off effects. I. would like to take this opportunity to point out that together with our Q1 results, we've. also published our Solvency II SFCR reports for the full year 2017. This provide a lot of. additional qualitative as well as quantitative information on top of the solvency ratios that. we have already published with our year-end results. You will find them on our company. website. The remarkable top line development of 27.5% adjusted for currency's effects in. the first quarter of 2018 is driven by both business units but derives to a large extent from. our P&C business, we will come to that.. The difference in gross – of gross in that premium is due to the change in unearned. premiums which will be earned throughout the year, so the differences will become. smaller as the year goes on. The retention ratio even increased slightly as compared to. the last year. The income and the expenses on a group level decreased mainly due to FX. effects. The increase in group net income was a little bit less pronounced compared to. the EBIT resulting from an unfavorable tax rate. The reason for that unfavorable tax rate is. a one-time increase based on the restructuring of group internal retrocessions before the. background of the U.S. tax reform, we mentioned that already late 2017 and during the. first quarter of 2018 we were able to achieve all required approvals from the supervisory. authorities as well as ratings to implement our new structure. Such business transfers. caused a one-off tax burden of around €22 million. For the ongoing tax rate, we do not. expect sustainable changes.. On the next slide, you can see that the operating cash flow in the first quarter was. particularly strong driven by strong reinsurance growth as well as pleasing results on the. investment side. Such developments were partly mitigated by negative impacts on the. valuation from rising interest rates and hardening euro.. On the other hand, as a proceeding step before we issued our first senior bond with the. volume of €750 million early in Q2 2018, we had entered into a bank loan with the same. amount. Background here was the support of the transfer of capital between companies. as a result of the U.S. tax reform driven restructuring.. Overall, assets under own management increased slightly to the mentioned €40.5 billion.. If we look at the capital side, you can see that the positive earnings this quarter did not. entirely compensate for the negative currency effects and also the yield impacts hence. leading to a 2.1% decrease in shareholders' equity. The recently issued bonds, I. mentioned already, was just a senior note and will not change or affect the hybrid bucket.. That means we still have enormous flexibility on our balance sheet. By the way, we issued. the senior notes for the upcoming growth of financing L&H business particularly in Asia. and Australia.. The P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 38.8%, so nearly 40% of FX-adjusted. basis. This is mainly driven by the successful business written by our structured. reinsurance team and overall is in line with our reporting on this year's January renewals.. This growth also includes some larger transactions of our traditional business line,. especially in Asia and Australia. Traditional lines thereby contributed approximately 12. percentage points to the nominal growth of around 28% in P&C.. Net premium earned increased by 22.4% adjusted for currency exchange rates, and that. was based on the increase in the unearned part of the premium as already mentioned. A. 3.4% of net premium income, major losses were again below budget. For the first quarter,. the underwriting result is on a good level as the combined ratio of 95.9% comes in below. the full year maximum target of 96%.. As in previous years, we stuck to our reserving practice and kept a large loss expectations. as part of our IBNR reserves. We've also not changed our reserving for the application of. the Ogden rates in the UK, all case reserves here are still based on the negative 72 basis. points discount rate.. It is also important to bear in mind that the increase in structured reinsurance business. generally leads to higher combined ratios as the lower – less (00:11:29) transfers justifies. also lower margins. With more than a quarter of our P&C premium coming from. structured reinsurance in Q1, the achievement of our 96% target is therefore actually. pleasing. So, early in the year, any comments on the development of our confidence level. in the reserves are actually uncertain and we have not changed our approach to setting. up reserves and with large losses under budget, we do not expect any material changes. to the year-end level.. Ordinary investment income was stable and other income and expenses broadly. unchanged. Altogether, net income for our P&C business stands at €235 million, up by 9%. compared to an already big (00:12:23) first quarter of the previous year.. Major losses were significantly lower than in the previous year despite the fact that the. net loss from natural catastrophes and man-made events in the first quarter 2017 had. already been below the expected level, therefore, the annual budget amounts to. approximately €94 million. As usual, the list of major losses in the first quarter is. comparatively low. Next, to Friederike, only one property and one credit claim made it on. large loss list in Q1.. On the next slide you can see that the picture is quite a mixed one. Overall, the combined. ratio is below the maximum tolerable combined ratio. The main contributors to the good. underwriting result of the first quarter were Continental Europe, marine, credit, and. surety, and of course the nearly loss-free Cat XL business. North America here was. impacted by negative reserve development from the previous years, here especially the. Californian wildfires which occurred late in the year developed slightly negatively.. Aviation saw some general aviation claims within the UK business we increased our nonproportional motor business, which comes in with high initial loss ratio assumptions. remarkably above 100%.. For life and health segment, the reinsurance gross written premium increased slightly by. 2% or a little bit more by 9.2% adjusted for currency exchange rates. New business. production was particularly favorable in Asia and the UK. The technical result has improved. by quite a margin overall. This stems mainly from worldwide business excluding the U.S.. and in particularly from the morbidity business.. After a number of quarters of underperformance, our U.S. mortality legacy portfolio did. better and delivered a result above our current expectations given that the underwriting. results on this slide here also includes the income from funds withheld. It is worth. mentioning that income from funds withheld declined by €17 million due to the. discontinuation of two large treaties.. As explained earlier, the significant decrease in the other income and expenses can be. explained by currency effects in the first quarter. Apart from this, the result from U.S.. financial solution treaties recognized according to the deposit accounting method. contributed €45 million, a figure largely unchanged from the previous year.. Having set a new target of EBIT growth of 5% per annum, we fared quite well and. achieved 6.9% increase compared to the previous years in Q1. I already explained the. one-off effect of about €22 million from the U.S. tax reform driven changes which. percentage-wise have an even higher impact for the business improve on its own.. This effect will not go away over the course of the year but as a one-off impact it should. be diluted or it should dilute down from quarter-to-quarter. Looking at the investment, the. development of the first three months of 2018 is very satisfactory with investment income. above our return expectation for the full year remarkably above that expectation. The. ordinary investment income was on the previous year's high level and therefore favorable. given that the decrease or the decrease of dividends from our listed equity portfolio. which we saw in Q3 (00:16:55) last year.. Realized gains were a little bit higher than in the previous years, but all in all virtually in line. with the full year's expectation, here is to no longer continue with our Barbell strategy and. our intention to decrease our exposure to lower quality credits as they have performed. so well in the past before that background, the sale of some of these investments came. with the realization of positive valuation reserves.. The change in the fair value of financial instruments is predominantly driven by the change. above the ModCo derivatives, but as you can see, this is only through to (00:17:39). margin extent. Overall the return on investment was 3.3% making us pretty confident to. achieve the full year's target of 2.7% given that interest rates particularly the dollar and. British sterling have increased and spreads in European and U.S. corporates have widened. a little bit in the first quarter. The valuation reserves decreased compared to year-end. which on the other hand is associated with a higher reinvestment yield.. The next slide here shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes. contributed to the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On. the right-hand side, you can see that we have some changes in our asset allocation with. some minor changes in the first quarter. The left-hand side illustrates the very strong. performance of our private equity portfolio and the continued positive contribution from. real estate. As I have explained, the 13% from the private equity is expected to trend. towards a more normal level over the course of the year. But the impact on our real. estate portfolio should, well, even increase slightly over the course of the year.. I think this should conclude my remarks about the financials. As usual, I leave the target. markets and the outlook to Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Yes. If – considering that we had a good result already during the first. quarter of last year, it is quite pleasing that the result for the first quarter 2018 supports. almost all of our strategic targets. We are particularly happy that both of our business. groups achieved (00:19:42) results reporting all their targets from the target matrix.. Coming to the second quarter renewals, particular the 1st of April renewals. The renewals. were actually quite similar from a market environment point of view compared to the. renewals at January 1. Loss-free business was mainly renewing flat with only very slight. increases. More meaningful rate increases were restricted to treaties, which suffered. losses during the year or during the last year. The business remains very competitive.. There's continued imbalance between supply and demand favoring the reinsurance. buyers.. Nevertheless, we were reasonably satisfied as a result of the renewal for Hannover Re as. we were able to achieve a double-digit growth again which is not too dissimilar to the. January 1 renewal for our traditional property-casualty treaty business. The main part of. the renewal was, of course, Japan where almost all the business renews at 1st of January.. On the property side, which is the most reinsurance business being bought, the rates. were absolutely flat. Some reported as flat as a pancake. As a result, we applied. unchanged capacity from a catastrophe point of view. And overall, we saw a slight. decrease of our premium income. This mainly comes from a reduction of some of our. proportional treaties, which were the result of some portfolio management actions.. On the casualty side, there was further losses relating to pharmaceutical risk which were. reported in the first quarter. And of course meant that, here, the rates were increasing. again, however we applied a rather restrictive policy to the terms and conditions of those. casualty treaties.. On the other hand, we saw significant increases in the Caribbean; there in particular, the. loss-laden (00:22:21) business from Puerto Rico was up for renewal. So, there, of course,. we saw significant increases and also an increase in volume. Also we cautiously increased. our involvement in the agricultural business from India, which resulted in a doubling of the. premium income there, even though from a relatively small level.. In North America, we were able to achieve some growth on the property business due to. rate increases, but continued our cautious approach to the casualty business, but our. premiums develop rather flat. The renewals on the property catastrophe excess of losses. very much resembles the experience from 1st of January which meant that the rate. (00:23:19) increases overall were a little bit disappointing and we kept our capacity and. utilization unchanged.. And this resulted in a slight increase in the premium income due to some rate increases.. Giving (00:23:39) the favor of development of the premiums in the first quarter and on. the renewal at 1st of April, we were able to up our guidance for the development of the. gross written premium to now more than 10%.. Likewise, the favorable investment result in the first quarter already explained by Roland is. slightly improved the return on equity on investment guidance from around 2.7%-plus to at. least 2.7%, only a very subtle change.. Regarding the group net income and the dividend payout guidance is unchanged as. regards to the dividend payout, considering the current development of our business and. the very comfortable solvency ratio, we would consider again to pay a special dividend. also for 2018 which should result in an overall dividend payout at least to the level of last. year. Naturally, this is an early indication and it's of course subject to the development of. the business during the remainder of the year.. But the market development continues to be somewhat disappointing considering the. large loss burden from last year. Nevertheless, the less (00:25:13) we feel that we are in a. good position to earn the cost of capital or even in excess of the cost of capital in most. areas of our diversified property casualty reinsurance portfolio.. We are particularly pleased with the development of the volume as well as the profitability. in Continental Europe, there our business already last year performed excellently. In. addition, growth will be particularly pronounced in the structured reinsurance business as. well as in the worldwide reinsurance business due to the large transactions which have. already been mentioned.. Regarding our life and health business, we expect continued excellent profitability in our. financial solutions business, particular stemming from the U.S. On the other hand, the U.S.. mortality business will continue to be a burden to the bottom line which also means that in. this category, we are likely not able to achieve result supporting the cost of capital.. On the other hand, our non-U.S. mortality business continues to develop very favorable. with EBIT margins close to double digit numbers. Premium growth, we expect mainly to. come from the morbidity business where we also expect improved results, which meet. our cost of capital requirements.. On the longevity business, we see a rather stable development both on the bottom and. on the top line, which however could change regarding the premium growth at this. business, it's really quite bulky. And it depends if some of our quotations on the larger. transactions come to fruition.. Overall, we feel that we are well-positioned to continue to be successful in the. reinsurance business in the short and in the longer term future. As you know that our. recent strategy revision creating value through reinsurance, we concentrate our efforts. almost entirely to the reinsurance business that we feel we have a favorable competitive. position.. On the property and casualty business, we are confident that we will continue to be able. to reach our combined ratio target and increase the bottom and the top line of the. business. Of course, the fact that an increased portion of the business stems from the. structured reinsurance business which has a lower risk transfer but also lower risk margins,. as Roland explains the combined ratio target becomes a little bit more challenging.. On our life and health reinsurance business, we expect that 2018 will continue to be. negatively influenced by losses from our legacy U.S. business. The extent of the negative. influence will also depend on the recaptures, which may occur as a result of our more. aggressive in-force management actions regarding rate increases. From 2019 onwards,. however, we expect positive development of the profitability of this business. Continued. stable returns on investment will definitely be aided by the increasing interest rate in. particular in respect of U.S. dollar investment.. On that note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation covering. the good start we have made for 2018 and we'll be delighted to answer your questions.. Thank you very much.. Q&A. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. The first. question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for me. The first one, just on the outlook for. the mid-year, I guess on your comments and from the call you've talked about plenty of. excess capacity to the existing, but at the same time, you've kind of reported that you're. seeing very, very strong increases on loss effect (00:30:31) of business. So just intrigued. about your views on how the mid-year, I guess June, July renewals will go. So, that's. question one.. Second question also on pricing, you've talked about, I guess, the underlying casualty. business stabilizing. Just interested on your thoughts on I guess a withdrawal of capacity. from a large player in that market announced last week and how do you think that might. affect that market going forward? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Regarding the outlook for mid-year pricing – thank you for your questions, Kamran.. What I would say, I mean of course on 01/06, the Florida renewal season will be quite. interesting even though a number of treaties are multi-year, so the effects will probably. be not at large. I'm afraid that I'm not very optimistic on the Florida renewals because that. business is dominated by the ILS market, and for the ILS market, Florida is key for their. portfolio and, I mean, the demand for reinsurance in Florida is not increasing this year as. far as we can see, but the supply definitely will.. So, I'm optimistic that we will see rate increases on Florida particular this movement of the. Irma loss recently. But I don't think all the hopes of the market will be fulfilled in that. renewal. The remainder of the mid-year (00:32:19) renewal I think they'll follow the 01/01. and 01/04 theme. There, I mean, loss making treaties, we'll see increases I expect. particular on the U.S. property business outside Florida I expect further increases like we. have seen before.. On the casualty business, it's really difficult one to read because, I mean, there are. definitely areas certainly in the U.S. where we see increases like commercial load-off. (00:33:00), and also, I mean, we have seen increased loss activity on D&O (00:33:05).. So, their prices which have been reduced for years seem to be catching up. I mean, but I. think in the short term, the business will continue to be competitive there despite the. withdrawal you were talking about. I think it all depends on the development of the runoff. results from previous years seems to be that the cautions of redundancies and the loss. reserves of the casualty business are drying up, and we may even see deficiencies. And. that development coupled with the inflationary development will depend what happens. to the casualty business. For us for the time being, we apply, as I said, a rather cautious. approach to casualty business.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks for the color.. Operator. The following question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you. So, just two questions focusing on Life Re, please. I'm a bit curious that the – I. mean, the ongoing flu season or just in the U.S. was quite bad. I mean, the data suggests. very high level, maybe a one-off, but very high level of mortality. But your comments are. completely sort of ambivalent to that. Could you just comment about the guidance and. what you're [Technical Difficulty] (00:34:46-00:34:55)?. Ulrich Wallin. Vinit, I don't know whether you can hear us without any problem. The line doesn't work.. Vinit Malhotra. Is it better?. Operator. I think you're pressing digits on your key pad. Now, it's better.. Ulrich Wallin. Vinit Malhotra. Is it better? Is it better? Even better? Hello?. Operator. Yes. Please go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Sorry, thank you. So, apologies for the technology. I'm out of the office today. Sorry.. The Life Re, so two questions on Life Re, please. The first one is that we have seen the. U.S. mortality affected by very high flu-related deaths. Could you comment on whether. your guidance incorporates that? And what your experience was in 1Q?. And second question is on the 5% EBIT growth target, how should we interpret that going. forward? What should be the baseline, if it implying that on a normal basis, you want to. grow 5% from 2019 onwards? Or how should we look at that? Thank you very much.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, Vinit. Thank you for those questions. Well, on the flu season, we haven't seen it in the. first quarter, is that – it's however, a little bit the result of the reporting which is a little bit. delayed on that business. And as the business is also underwritten by our subsidiaries, it's. also relatively early close of (00:36:27) of the quarter. So, the flu season effect will be. more pronounced in the second quarter.. Early indications are not supporting that in the figures as yet, but of course, I mean it has. to be brought in mind that we have changed our expectations to higher mortality as well.. But, yeah, so far so good, I would say, from the experience we have seen, but we will. certainly have a much better color on that for the second quarter. But as, I mean, even in. the first quarter, on the U.S. mortality, we didn't make money. The only thing is we've only. lost half as much as we thought that we would lose.. On the 5%, yeah, that's on a normalized basis. I mean, we just want to increase on a. normalized basis going forward, the EBIT by 5% every year, say on average, say in a fiveyear period. But of course the basis for that should not be the low EBIT that we have. experienced in 2017 and we are expecting for 2018, but more a normalized EBIT.. We have done that and we have done away with the EBIT margins because with the. particularities of the business, we would have to take those – I mean margin requirements. on an EBIT margin, on a much more granular basis in order to make sense. We obviously. have seen that on the financial solution business, which is deposit accounting (00:38:32),. which of course we haven't, not booking any premium but booking positive results, which. of course skews that kind of metrics. Therefore, we thought we make it a little bit more. simple and go for an EBIT growth.. Does that answer the questions?. Vinit Malhotra. Oh, yes. Thanks very much. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, thank you, Vinit.. Operator. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first one is also on Life Re. How. 2018? After the start, I would just would like to have some of your thoughts by how much. you think you run now ahead of your plans?. And then, secondly, you mentioned within the geographical split on the combined ratios. that there was also a deterioration of your California wildfire loss. Could you quantify the. impact there, please?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, Frank. On the life business, I mean, it's quite volatile on a quarterly basis.. So, I would not dare to say that we run ahead of our EBIT target. Of course, if you divide. the €200 million by 4, you might say, well, it's almost twice that what we were expecting.. But, I mean, we have actually started to be very – a little bit more aggressive for managing. the rates of the business efforts. And, of course, we expect that we will see some. recapture as a result. And, therefore, I think that depending on the recapture for the €200. million might either be challenging or comfortably reachable. So, it's a little bit early to say. over the year we will get better clarity on that one.. Then on the California wildfires, here we saw increased loss advises (00:40:55) there.. Also on some treaties there we didn't expect it. And therefore, we had an increase there. of around €21 million. The remainder of the cat losses remained on a net basis, a little bit. more stable because, in particular, Maria and Irma are sitting just in the lower end of our. whole account protections. And as a result of that, any further development of them will. not have an effect on the net position. We think there that the combination of the K. (00:41:38) transaction recovery – and the only recovery even taken into account. reinstatement premiums, the losses are pretty much fixed there.. Frank Kopfinger. Okay. Perfect. Thanks.. Operator. The following question is from Guilhem Horvath of Exane PNB Paribas. Please go ahead.. Guilhem Horvath. on the decision you made to change your investment strategy and to stop the Barbell. strategy and the reason for that?. what you did exactly? I'm a bit surprised to see these one off being quite small at the end. bit on the complexity of the changes you've made here to comply with the new U.S. tax. Ulrich Wallin. I think Roland that's for you.. Roland Vogel. It sounds so. Yeah, the investment strategy, we have been pursuing our Barbell strategy. with the increasing liquidity with more govies and taking a little bit more risk on the lower. quality side over the last, I think, two to three years which we've held, had worked out. fine.. We've achieved where we want it to be. Still then we saw especially in the U.S. dollar that. the lower quality credits were performing extremely well. So, that had worked out fine.. Still, it was quite clear that the potential upside going forward here we felt would be very. limited. And on the other hand, we also saw that the illiquidity premium we were getting. there was really going down. This is why we stopped it. Then, of course, you have to. decide where do you put that money, we invested a little bit more across the board and. leave the lower credit aside especially in the U.S. dollar but also in the euro. That means. we are for getting (00:43:48) a little bit of extra premium there, but it is really we did a. calculation over the – for the whole portfolio. The ROI is not the potential expected ROI.. It's affected only to a really minor extent by that strategy that is the changes.. And again, to come back to your question, it is really the minimal upside after the good. performance, which we have seen and the achievement of our strategy beforehand. With. regard to the tax reform, you could say that were a little bit lucky. We had already. established a few years ago a Bermudian company which has opted to pay taxes in the. the U.S. so it can do the XXX financing business. And the other hand, it pays taxes in the. U.S. so it's not affected by the base erosion and the the U.S. tax bid (00:45:00), so that. the company was already existing, we needed more capital, we needed some approvals. from the supervisory authorities. We needed a rating that was achievable in the short. timeframe. It was a lot of work but it was achievable. So, we had to transfer capital and. business between those companies to address the issues of the bid (00:45:26) which. was achieved. Now, we were retroceding (00:45:29) business through lower tax. environments before and but also to Germany with higher taxes and overall the run rate. should again not be affected materially.. Guilhem Horvath. Okay, very clear. Thanks.. Operator. The following question is from Andrew Ritchie. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. I just wondered if you could clarify on the structured solutions business. Is all of. that now in – I appreciate your (00:46:02) earned premium but in gross written, is that the. expected volume pretty much booked for 2018 as we can see already? What would be. the limit on writing – continue to write lots more of this business? What would be the. reason not to keep writing it, if it is so seemingly low risk?. The other question just a clarification. Your U.S. life business that you were booking at 12%. tax rate is not only booked to 21% moving from Ireland to Bermuda. Why does that not. affect the ongoing tax rates? It's just the assumption that you won't make money in the. U.S.?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the structured solution business, of course we are continuing to develop that. business and I think it's fair to say that throughout the year we will see additional writings. of that business. Recently, we were successful on a number of transactions which we. could account as deposit accounting. So, they will only show up on the bottom line and not. on the top line. But it is continuing attractive business. So, we expect further growth from. that business throughout the year. Of course, it has to be said that this business has a few. very large transactions.. So, if you look ahead in the coming years, it can be quite volatile because, I mean, this. business is only sold if it makes sense for the seeding (00:47:38) company and their. capital management. Things might change and so this business might go – it goes up at. this point in time. And there's also a possibility that it might go back – go down at other. times. As my colleague, who is responsible it, Jürgen Gräber always says that it's. breathing volume which at this point in time is breathing in quite a lot out of (00:48:00). sales.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. And on the taxes, I would again hand to – go back to Roland because it's such a. complicated issue.. Roland Vogel. Look, I think that calculation at the comparison of before restructuring and after. restructuring is really based on multiplying an expected income with an existing tax rate.. Those have changed. Some of that business was taxed in Ireland with 12.5% and is taxed. with 21%,. Some of that business beforehand taxed in Germany with 32% and is now tax. with 21%. What we lose on the Irish side was, of course, a little also driven by the lower. expected profit based on the fact that the legacy U.S. mortality business had its effect on. the protected income for the future. And if we look at the transfer of the business, the. expected profits, and multiply that with the applicable tax rates, it's a rush (00:49:22) and. the expected overall tax rate is around where it had been before.. Ulrich Wallin. And if I may add, of course, a fair amount of that business remains in our U.S. subsidiary,. and that is actually quite profitable. So, the results of our U.S. subsidiary have been quite. profitable. And, of course, there the lowering of the tax rates is actually helping us,. because the profits from our U.S. company is actually taxed not – no longer than 35% but. only this 21%.. I guess the critical thing is presumably the financial solutions business in the U.S., which is. the most profitable bit, that's not incurring a heavier tax load?. Partly, that's true. It's only true to the extent it's not kept (00:50:12) in the U.S., which some. of it is but there's no good reason for seeding (00:50:17) it. But then, of course, an island. now in the Bermuda, U.S. taxpayer, that business is bundled with the underperforming U.S.. mortality business.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. So, in the short term, of course, the tax is even should we be able to bring the U.S.. mortality business to its full profitability. And, of course, I mean, the tax rate will. presumably be a little bit higher.. Roland Vogel. Right.. <"": Okay. "". Ulrich Wallin. But that's a problem we would like (00:50:47) to have.. Andrew J. Ritchie. All right. Great. Thank you.. Operator. The following question is from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Your line is now open.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning. Two questions on my side. The first one would be related to the Life. and Re (00:51:03) business and the U.S. legacy book. So, I guess that now we entered. Q2, I guess that you have already started to approach clients in terms of higher rate. submission and potentially starting to engage on the need to implement recapturing.. Could you give us a feel of what you see? What has been the client's reaction so far to. what you have proposed to them? I mean, is there any surprise or any granularity that you. could provide that would truly help us to better understand what could be achieved in Q3. and Q4 on that front?. And the second question will be related to the P&C Re business. Obviously, very strong. growth on the structured solutions side, could you help us to understand what has been. the drag on the combined ratio in Q1 from the 95.9% and what is expected to be the drag. on a full year basis? Of course, you – keeping your guidance of below 96% unchanged,. but with such a strong rate of growth (00:52:17) in the business, if you could guide a bit on. what we should expect on the traditional side and then the drag from the structured. solutions? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. On the reaction from the clients to rate increases, I mean so far, we are engaged in. that actually for a number of years now. In all situations, we found an agreement with the. seeding (00:52:47) companies how to deal with it. So it has not been controversial. We. have a little bit more pronounced action now in the second quarter, little bit too early to. say what the reactions is. I mean so far neutral, a little bit better than we were expecting. actually. But that will be hammered out in the next six months. So I mean, we will see. where we go. That's for that.. I mean, on the combined ratio, of course, I mean the large portion of the structured. reinsurance business will cost us about 1 percentage point in the combined ratio this year. which means that the 96% would mean a 95% or even a little bit below 95%, maybe. 94.5% on the traditional reinsurance business. I mean, if the large losses remain of this in. It's slightly better than it was the quality of the business; it's slightly better than it was last. year from pricing point of view and on a fiscal year basis. Admittedly, it's not on a fiscal. year basis, it's not quite as good as 2016. But we still feel that with our competitive. advantage of our low expense ratio, that that should be achievable even without. increasing our writings of property catastrophe business and hoping that the losses won't. happen. Does that answer the question?. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Andreas Schäfer of Bankhaus Lampe. Your line is now open.. Andreas Schäf er. Thanks a lot. So, there's just one question left from my side, with respect to the. unrealized capital gains, not only on the fixed income side but also on other assets and. the unrealized capital gains dropped quite strongly, I think, something like more than €70. million. Could you explain a bit what kind of asset classes are strongly impacted by this. drop and is it really related to the rise in interest rates?. Roland Vogel. I think that is quite clearly, as it did (00:55:26) and obvious, the increases in interest rates. especially in the U.S. dollar have caused the decrease in our valuation reserves to that. extent. The rest is really driven by the real estate portfolio, also the private equity. portfolio. We really haven't lost anything material there. We might even also see a few. more realizations over the cost – over the course of the year.. So, in that regard, the decrease in valuation reserves, which comes with a slight decrease. in our capital position is really what we have been asking for over the last years,. complaining about the low yield environment. Now, the low yields are slightly increasing. and that is associated with the decrease in the valuation reserves. It is, I would say, I don't. have the percentage bit (00:56:38) but the vast majority is really driven by the fixed. income portfolio and the rising interest rates.. Andreas Schäf er. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. The next question is from Vikram Gandhi of Societe Generale. Your line is now open.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi. Morning, everybody. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, can you comment on how. should we think about the run-off result for this quarter? Would you say it is €100 million. the quarterly run rate less the negative €20 million development that you mentioned on. the California wildfires?. And secondly can you comment again on the rationale of the debt raising and its. connection to the Life Re business? I'm sorry my line was bad and couldn't catch your. opening remarks. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Roland, do you want.... Roland Vogel. Yeah. I can take it. As we mentioned at various occasions before not too easy to have the. runoff result hammered out, I would say we have seen some positive runoff next to the. negative development of the wildfires. We have also set up reserves according to the. usual practice. So we might have buildup. So, overall the number was a little bit higher. than the one that you mentioned from a quantitative point of view but with the. remarkable initial conservative reserving again we feel that the confidence level should. not be impacted materially. Again it was a little bit higher from a quantitative standpoint. than the number that you mentioned.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Well, a little bit more than about €100 million even including the negative development of. the wildfires.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. Answer for the debt.. Roland Vogel. And the rationale of the debt sorry. So there was – so we had really strong demand from. our live colleagues to also do cash free financing business again various large transactions. in the pipeline that together with capital requirements plus also the increase in private. equity and real estate that was a little bit of strain on the liquidity of the SE, not a full. group but the SE as the financer of all these things and also to be flexible, a little bit more. flexible again in our investment strategy.. We felt that it would help to have more cash available. We had prepared debt for Q2. because that was the time when we had expected the materialization of the. requirements from the life financing around the world. Then, we had the U.S. tax reform. with some capital movements within the group. So, you can imagine that we no longer. need that much money in Ireland, and we need more money in Bermuda. It takes a little. bit to convince the Irish authority to give that fee so we needed, which we then can take. to send over to Bermuda.. And on that basis, we felt it would be good to have €750 million a little bit earlier on to. give us the flexibility to do the restructuring. And on that basis, we'd entered into that. bank loan and that was with the majority of the banks involved continuing were then. transferred into the senior loan in Q2.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. That's very clear, Roland. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Roland Pfänder of ODDO BHF AG. Your line is now open.. Roland Pf änder. Yes. Good morning. Two short questions from my side. First, regarding your interest. income from funds withheld. You mentioned that you discontinued two treaties, so is it a. new level we reached here or might that figure deteriorate further?. Second question, I think if I'm not mistaken, I saw that your aviation business volume –. you're a little bit more positive here, are there any reasons for this you could speak here. on this? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, interest from funds withheld, I mean, this was really due to the fact that two. cash financing treaties which were on the funds withheld basis were recaptured because. financing was being paid back plus the margin. There's quite, quite normal – in fact, I mean. for the entire year we are not expecting this to deteriorate through further or to come. down further because of the various financing opportunities we are currently working on.. So, I mean, in the forecast this number is not coming down compared to last year. But it. really depends on the individual transactions.. Aviation was the income is relatively flat there, not going down further, that is in line with. the development of the premiums. I mean, airlines are slightly hedging up. And also on. the aviation excess of loss, it's a more stable situation than it was before, therefore the. income is also stable. I mean, there's a little bit of reshuffling in the portfolio. I mean the. one larger client they decided not to buy any, any proportionate aviation reinsurance any. longer. At the same time, there's another one we have a very longstanding relationship.. So, we were able to increase our line in the aviation quota share, and excess of loss. (01:03:07) was slightly up. So, that putting all together, I think we have found the low level. point on the aviation I would say. At least, I hope that because that was a class, I was. underwriting myself for so long.. Roland Pf änder. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. There are currently no further questions. There are no further questions. I hand back to. the speakers.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. So, thank you very much for calling in. And, again, for those of you in the UK, have. very nice bank holiday. Sorry for interrupting it early in the morning. For everybody else,. have a very nice and productive day. Thank you very much again.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect.",20180507_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2018-5-7_FS000000002428288194.pdf,2018-05-07
20,"Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our. conference call presenting our results for the first half of the year. This is the first results. call in my role as CEO of Hanover Re. And I'm pleased to be able to present a good set. of numbers.. As usual, our CFO, Roland Vogel, will go over the financials in detail and additionally, I'm. joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff for the Q&A.. Our business developed favorably. In the first half of 2019, we recorded double-digit top. and bottom line growth, which is particularly pleasing because the previous year's result. was already on a good level. Gross premium increased by 14.5% adjusted for currency. effects, reflecting an increased demand for reinsurance. Strong investment income and. good underwriting profitability in P&C, combined with a significantly improved earnings. contribution from our life and health business group caused group net income to rise to. EUR 663 million.. The very strong result in life and health is, in large part driven by a positive one-off effect. resulting from the restructuring of our shareholding in Viridium. Although it should be. noted that last year's in-force management actions for our legacy U.S. mortality business. also had the expected positive impact on the results.. Despite the dividend payout in the Second Quarter, shareholders' equity rose by more. than EUR 1 billion. It is therefore even more gratifying that the return on equity of 14.3%. improved on the previous year and is clearly above our minimum target. The solvency. ratio remains significantly above our 200% threshold, standing at 249% at the end of the. First Quarter. And it should be stable or slightly lower in the Second Quarter based on. preliminary calculations.. Premiums in our P&C reinsurance business continued to grow strongly. Even though the. market environment remained competitive, we have seen positive dynamics in both. primary and reinsurance markets. The large losses in the first half year were well below. the expected levels, however, due to our unchanged conservative reserving policy, this is. largely not reflected in the underwriting results to date.. On the other hand, the underwriting result does include around EUR 100 million in loss. creep from Typhoon Jebi. Against this backdrop, it is encouraging to see that the 96.7%. combined ratio still remained below our 97% target.. In life and health reinsurance, we saw good opportunities for new business in Asia, fueling. the gross premium growth of 7.4%, adjusted for currency effects. The underwriting result. is weaker compared to a good result in the previous year. And here the main reasons. were some negative effects from our Australian and the U.K. business. The combined. negative effect of the 2 together is in the mid-double-digit million range. The result of the. ING portfolio that we acquired in 2009 was in line with our latest assumptions. And our. financial solutions business again contributed strongly to the result. Overall EBIT increased. by 30.3% to EUR 286 million driven by the already mentioned one-off effect. The. performance of our investments continue to exceed our target for the year of more than. 2.8%. Excluding the one-off gain from Viridium, the return on investment from assets. under management was 3.1% on an annualized basis.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain these figures in. more detail.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Good morning. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Maybe one short remark before I start. For. those interested in analyzing our reserve situation in more detail, we have published the. P&C loss reserve triangles as of December 2018 on our website today.. We continue to see very attractive top line growth in the first half year of 2019. Adjusted. for currency effects, gross written premium increased by 14.5%. This was driven by. favorable business production in both business groups, albeit again with another major. contribution from the P&C side. Net premium growth is slightly less dynamic due to the. change in unearned premium and a slightly lower retention in life and health. However,. this difference between gross and net premium will most likely shrink by year-end. because the change in unearned premium naturally decreases as we earn the premium. over the course of the year.. Other income expenses improved mainly due to a further increase in the contribution. from deposit accounted financial solutions treaties, while currency effects had a minor. impact in the first half year. At 22.9%, the tax rate is below the expected level. This is. mainly the result of the tax reduced gains from the revaluation of our share in Viridium.. Altogether, group net income, as already mentioned, increased by an impressive 19.3% to. EUR 663 million.. Operating cash flow was again very strong in the first six months, increasing by around. 50% as compared to the previous year. The main driver here is the growth of our P&C. reinsurance business. On top of this, increasing valuation reserves and currency effects. supported the growth in assets by around EUR 1.3 billion and EUR 250 million, respectively.. This, by far, more than overcompensated for the dividend payment in the Second. Quarter. Overall, assets under own management are at a record higher level, close to. EUR 45 billion.. Looking at the capital position, we see the comparable or the same effects. The dividend. payment in Q2 is fully covered by the profits of the first half year. On top of this, the. increase in OCI boosts the growth in shareholders' equity by 11%, almost entirely driven by. the variation change due to the decreased interest rates and lower credit spreads.. The composition of the total capital on the left-hand side of this slide is unchanged, with a. high degree of flexibility around the hybrid bucket. You will see gross premium on the. next slide increase by a remarkable 18.4%, off an -- on an FX-adjusted basis. This is driven. by both our structured reinsurance business and a well-diversified growth in the traditional. book worldwide and nearly across all lines of business. However, the growth rates in. structured reinsurance, in particular, should come slightly down over the course of the. year. And also the gap between gross and net premium growth should narrow, I. mentioned this already, due to the pattern of the premium recognition for some larger. contracts.. At 2.4% of net premium income, major losses were very benign and came in EUR 230. million below budget. As in the previous years, we stuck to our reserving practice and. reflected the large loss expectation as part of our IBNR reserves.. When it comes to runoff results, we have seen negative developments, in particular from. Typhoon Jebi, for which we increased our loss estimates by EUR 106 million in the full half. year based on an exceptional rise in the assumed market loss. Here it's important to say. that going forward, any potential further developments in relation to Jebi will have very. limited implications for our net account because the current loss level was just sufficient to. stretch at the lower limit of our whole account protection. Overall, the runoff profit was still. positive, as expected, with the aforementioned negative reserve development naturally. running a little bit contrary to the normal positive reserve runoff in the first half year. So. other than that, nothing extraordinary.. Given that we are talking about reserving the recent developments involving the Ogden. rates might be another topic of interest here. The decision to set the new rate at minus. 25 basis points, which is lower than most expected, means that we also had to adjust our. best estimate midpoint and lose around mid-double-digit million amount in reserve. redundancies. But most importantly, of course, we did not have to strengthen the. reserves in light of the revised decision because we have kept our reserving base at the. initial minus 75 discretion. Altogether, the approach that we do not offset negative. developments from prior year large losses with a benign experience from the current. year leads to a slight increase in the combined ratio in the first six months and particularly. in the Second Quarter. Therefore, the 96.7% combined ratio for the first half year. demonstrates, from my point of view, a healthy underlying profitability of our P&C. portfolio.. Net investment income decreased slightly. The favorable increase in the ordinary. investment income was offset by a lower level of realized gains. Other income and. expenses did not include any material one-offs. The tax rate is slightly higher than normal. mainly due to the weaker earnings contribution from our Bermudian subsidiary, which was. naturally affected by the Jebi runoff.. Group net income stable at EUR 434 million compared to the already very good first year. -- first half of the previous year.. Next slide. The major losses were significantly below the expected level, adding up to. EUR 141 million. This leaves us with a comfortable cushion of EUR 734 million to absorb. large losses in the remainder of the year, including, of course, the unused EUR 230 million. carried forward from the first half year. The large loss list is still rather short. After the first. half year of 2019, the net cat experience, in particular, was very benign. Man-made losses. were more in line with the expectations, mainly driven by the refinery loss in Philadelphia.. Looking at the Ethiopian Airlines loss, you can see that it has doubled on a net basis. compared to the number we reported in the First Quarter. This is because we had. previously allocated the loss from Boeing's grounding policy to the Lion Air loss in 2018. and now have moved this to the Ethiopian Airlines loss due to a different legal. interpretation of the policy wording. Our view on the overall loss has not changed in the. Second Quarter. The significant difference between the gross and net in this case. highlights the strong (retro) protection we buy for our aviation portfolio.. On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business are rather close to the target. and contributed to the good underwriting result. Exceptions here are the U.K., Ireland and. the London market as well as our cat business. The former was affected by rather weak. technical profitability of the Lloyd's business that we support apart from Argenta. And the. combined ratio for our cat XL business is mainly driven by the described development of. the Jebi loss, which is more or less fully captured within this business line.. As mentioned before, the benign net cat experience that we have seen so far in 2019 is. not reflected in this number due to our reserving policy. On the other hand, aviation and. marine are significantly below the target, benefiting from a favorable loss experience and. some positive reserve developments.. In L&H, the gross written premium increased by 7.4%, adjusted for currency effects. New. business production was particularly favorable in Asia and here with a focus in China. The. results for our U.S. mortality business are in line with our expectations as are the positive. effects from our (in-forced) management actions in 2018. However, this is less visible in. the difference compared to the previous years because the underlying mortality was. particularly good in the first half of 2018. The main reason for the decrease in the. underwriting result is an underperformance of our disability business in Australia.. Additionally, we have added some reserves for our U.K. business based on mortality. assumption changes. Both effects taken together are, as already mentioned, in the middouble-digit million range.. The ordinary investment income increased compared to the previous year. And the fair. value changes through P&L were also beneficial in the first half. As part of the realized. gains, we accounted for the one-off effect of around EUR 100 million from the revaluation. of our shareholding in Viridium, boosting net investment income to EUR 295 million. Other. income and expenses mainly driven by the further improvements and the contribution. from financial solutions business, particularly from the U.S., which, as you might remember,. is recognized in this line according to the deposit accounting method. As already. mentioned, the Viridium gain is nearly tax-free in Germany, pushing down the overall tax. rate to just 9%. Altogether, net income is up by 75% to EUR 258 million.. On the next slide, we are very satisfied with the development of our investments in the. first half. Excluding the Viridium effect, the return on investment would have been 3.1%,. which is remarkably above the expectation with increased ordinary investment compared. to the already-good figure in the previous years. Realized gains, apart from the Viridium. gain, were on a very low level. The change in fair value of financial instruments was. positive. The ModCo derivative, for those who are interested, contributed nearly EUR 9. million to that result.. Unrealized valuation gains increased by more than EUR 1 billion to EUR 2.2 billion mainly. driven by our fixed income portfolio due to the decreasing yield in our major currencies as. well as lower credit spreads. So overall, the flexibility to harvest valuation reserves has. increased remarkably. Still this would, of course, be associated with a higher dilution of. ordinary income in the future. And we haven't done that.. On the next slide, you can see that we did not change our asset allocation in the first half. year. The overall diversified contribution to ordinary investment income is again supported. by the results from real estate and private equity. But not to any extraordinary extent.. I think this should conclude my remarks. And I'll leave the target metrics and the outlook to. you Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Roland. Next slide, the target matrix reflects the good performance of our. business in the first half of the year with all targets being reached. There's really not too. much to add at this stage and we can move on directly to the outlook.. The June-July treaty renewals went quite well for us, even though the reinsurance. markets continue to be shaped by intense competition and surplus capacities. We saw. some positive dynamics as a consequence of the considerable natural catastrophe losses. in 2017 and 2018 and also the development of those losses. In the U.S., primary market. conditions and rates firmed, in particular for property business, although casualty markets. also saw some slight improvements. Against this backdrop, we were in a position to. significantly increase our premium in North America. The same is also true of our U.S. and. Florida cat business, where rate increases were most substantial. But still did not prompt a. shift in our risk appetite for Florida cat business.. Outside of the U.S. too, we continue to see healthy demand from our clients. And were. able to grow our business on a diversified basis. Overall, premium increased by 20.3%. driven by both new business and price increases as well as higher shares and volumes on. existing business.. This leads me straight on to the expectation for our total property and casualty business.. On the outlook by reporting line, you can see many arrows pointing upwards, confirming. the favorable demand for reinsurance and more specifically for Hannover RE as a. preferred business partner.. The profitability of our book is also satisfactory, enabling us to earn a margin at or above. the cost of capital in all areas. Overall, I believe that we're well positioned to continuously. outperform the market due to our strong competitive positioning.. In life and health reinsurance, the expected growth is somewhat more modest, compared. to P&C. We see good opportunities for further growth in morbidity -- in the morbidity. business, mainly in Asia, while demand for financial solutions also remains strong.. However, I'd like to point out again that significant parts of our financial solutions portfolio. are deposit accounted. And hence, no premium is booked. Therefore, this arrow is not a. perfect indicator of the business development in this case.. Looking at the profitability across the lines of business. All lines are expected to earn the. cost of capital or more. Profitability is particularly strong in financial solutions, where our. U.S. business is the main driver.. Altogether, the improved result expected for the 2019 financial year should be a better. reflection of the underlying profitability. This is because the profitability of our mortality. business will improve significantly due to the enforced management actions and the. associated one-off IFRS charges taken in 2018.. Finally, we come to the group outlook for the year 2019. We have decided not to review. our guidance given that the main part of the hurricane season is right ahead of us.. However, this also means that, as before, the Viridium effect is not included in the roughly. EUR 1.1 billion group net income figure and should instead be seen as an addition. We will. review and update our earnings guidance with the publication of our Q3 results and have. therefore left the other parts of the guidance untouched as well at this stage.. Still I'd like to point out that in keeping with our unchanged approach to capital. management, the expected business development should allow us to again pay a special. dividend on top of the ordinary dividends, resulting in a total dividend at least on a par. with last year's level of EUR 5.25 per share.. On that note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation. And I look. forward to your questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) First question is from Emanuele Musio, Morgan Stanley.. Emanuele Musio. I have 2 questions. One is on P&C. So you had lost script from Jebi, you didn't use the. buffer. And this is consistent with your policy. So could you maybe remind me under which. circumstances you might decide to use a bit of that buffer? And also, this EUR 58 million. that you took in Q2 for Jebi, does it include some cushion that could potentially add to. your current buffer? And also on U.S. mortality, was there anything there that we should. see? So any detail on this will be helpful.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So maybe I take the P&C. As you mentioned -- rightly mentioned, the EUR 106 million from. Jebi do not run against any budget. So they come on top of our reserving policies. I also. did mention that the current Jebi level on the gross basis has been touching the whole. account protection. So there is no development on top to be expected in that regard. We. feel comfortable for the second half year. Would we use the buffer for something like. this? Not at this time of the year. So we would revisit that issue by year-end, see what the. exhaustion of the large loss budget would be at that point in time and then decide. Still. again, we are fully transparent with our redundancy development anyway. Maybe this is. for me the chance to add to that, which -- and I didn't do that before. We do expect the. large -- the redundancy levels being on the same. So no changes to be expected as. compared to the beginning of the year.. The second aspect was, is there any potential that the current reserving level would. increase the buffer? I would say, no, again, as we are -- we have the gross pull-in. We are. protected for another net development. So this should really be sufficient. We feel. comfortable. But this would not add a lot to potential net reserve buffers. Well we feel. conservatively. If it goes down from this stage, okay. But otherwise, I think this should be. flattish. Then mortality?. Klaus Wilhelm Miller. Yes. Klaus Miller from the Life side. The U.S. mortality is currently moving in line with our. expectations. That is for the Brock or the acquired ING business. The organic business. right now it's (with us) since 2009, is doing much better than expected. We have not. factored that into our expectations for the second half of 2020. So we see that as a result. which could easily happen any time. But from the YRT rate increases, if you are referring. to that, we have started arbitrations with a handful of companies, we might be able to. resolve 1 or 2 of them pretty soon. The rest will drag into 2020. And what you will see is -or you might remember, we have told you that when we win these arbitrations, what we. expect, the IFRS negative reserve, which will hit us, will gradually disappear over the next. 18 months. This is because we have to account for these treaties the same way as we did. in the past as if we would lose the arbitrations, what we don't anticipate. We expect to win. them 100%. But we will show losses under these treaties and the recapture charge as you. have seen last year will certainly -- or probably not happen in 2020, this will come through. as normal losses. And as soon as we win the arbitrations, we expect that the client. decides to recapture. And this will probably be a wash between IFRS losses from negative. reserves and losses we have to be reimbursed at that point in time when we have won. the arbitration. I hope that was the background of your question.. Emanuele Musio. Yes.. Operator. The next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC.. Kamran Hossain. Two questions for me. The first one is just on the charge that you took in Life Re, you. talked about U.K. mortality being an issue. Is there any offset from longevity? I know in the. past, you've said you're not really willing to recognize this for potentially even kind of. decades. But is there any offset there? So kind of color around that would be helpful.. And the second question, again, on Life Re. Could you help us perhaps normalize this. quarter for, I guess, the different moving parts on EBIT? I know we've got the negative. drag, which you said was double-digit millions. You've got the Viridium number. But just. kind of any idea on how we should get to an underlying number there, it'd be really. helpful.. Roland Helmut Vogel. I think you mentioned. And we said that before, Kamran, that we did not adjust any. assumptions on the annuity base -- on the annuity book. So there's no compensation for. that. That book is running as expected. So there should be a little bit of a reserve in it. So. we did not do anything in that regard. When it comes to the EBIT numbers. And what. Klaus explained here, I think, was overall the message that, yes, in the first half year, we. had a little bit of drag on -- from U.K. and from Australia. We went into the year with an. EBIT number of EUR 400 million. That was before Viridium. And in that regard, we should. expect that people feel these expectations for the next year. We unfortunately will have. no other Viridium. But also here, the EBIT forecast should not be affected at any significant. number based on what we know today.. Kamran Hossain. So just to summarize. And secondly, basically, you are -- if you take this course, you would. net back the -- I guess the charges, you're roughly on track for the 100 in this quarter, the. 100 as in the 400 divided by 4.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes.. Operator. The next question is from Farooq Hanif, CrÃ©dit Suisse.. Farooq Hanif. I was wondering, firstly, if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics that are. driving the really strong growth in U.S. financial solutions? So perhaps what's driving. demand or what's driving margin in that area and what we can look forward to in terms of. growth? And secondly, when you look at your cat XL business, obviously, it's been. impacted by Jebi when you show that profitability versus target. Would you move back. into the target range without Jebi? And what more kind of improvement do you expect. given the pricing conditions that you're seeing in the cat XL line?. Klaus Wilhelm Miller. Maybe I'll start -- so maybe I'll start with the U.S. and the increasing demand for financial. solutions. Whenever you have changes in regulation. And you've seen (80 48) coming into. play in the U.S., you have opportunities to optimize the capital structure of your company.. The financial solutions business has developed significantly over the last decade, I would. say. Of course, with equity, you can do everything or with 100% quota share, you also get. everything. But there are regulations first from rating agencies. They are probably. different between A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. There are cash flow. considerations. There is a need to invest in new business, digitization. So all these. companies try to become much more efficient on the capital side. And this is basically. driving the demand in these large developed markets. We have seen similar things in. China recently. We see similar things in Europe under Solvency II. And so we always have. balance sheet. Even Solvency II is not a real economic balance sheet. So this is basically. what is behind the U.S. business decline.. Farooq Hanif. Can I just -- may I just ask on that? So do you think the growth rate that you're seeing is. not exceptional. So we could see maybe in the next 1 or two years, similar levels of growth. given what you just said?. Klaus Wilhelm Miller. Definitely. I'm very convinced that our volume target here, what Jean-Jacques just. commented on in the outlook, is probably not correct in the sense of bottom line. But it's. correct in the sense of premium. He mentioned that a lot of this is not accounted for as. premium. But there is a demand. And we see this as one of the main drivers for the life. business in the future.. Sven Althoff. I'm Sven Althoff. On your questions regarding the cat, starting with the profit expectations.. You will have seen that we are guiding on the profitability side that we expect to make our. cost of capital. And this is coming from a mix of some very strong underlying profitability. when it comes to the current year 2019, where you have seen from the major loss side. that it has been a very benign cat year so far. And in combination with the price increases. that we have achieved at the 1/1, 1/4 and 1/7 renewals, we are convinced that we are at the. pricing level now across our entire portfolio where we can earn our cost of capital. And. when it comes to the expectation on renewals, this is, of course, a little difficult to answer,. given that the full hurricane season is still ahead of us. It would be our expectation that. even in a benign cat year in 2019 that we should not expect any deterioration in cat pricing. at the 1/1 renewals, more specifically, on the Japan renewals at the next 1/4 renewal. And. the reinsurance market only priced in Jebi as a loss as of the end of 2018. So the full. development, we and others are showing on Jebi has not been priced in at the 1st of. April, 2019 renewal. So we are expecting another significant increase in Japanese wind. pricing come next April.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And maybe I can add to your straightforward question, would we be in the profitable. range without Jebi? Yes, definitely. We would be significantly below the maximum target. of combined ratio.. Operator. The next question is from Sami Taipalus of Goldman Sachs.. Sami Taipalus. Yes. So my first question is just on the solvency ratio. Is it possible to just provide a little bit. of a walk maybe from the year-end. I guess, in particular, I'm a little bit surprised that. there's not been any pressure from the significant growth that you've had in the business,. particularly as some of this appears to have been in some quite capital-intensive lines. So. that's number one.. Number two, could you just talk a little bit about the low interest rate environment, if. there's any action you're thinking about taking there on investment mix? I think last year,. you talked about reducing the risk in your credit book. Do you think that's something that. you could potentially revisit given the drop in interest rates since then?. I think that is for me. Again, I think we had the discussion before. We don't have the. solvency details here with us. But the one thing I can tell you that, of course, driven by the. growth and the increase in exposures, the SCR has been increasing. On the other hand,. also based on the -- of course, profitability and other effects, especially also the. discounting and others, the owned funds have been growing in line with that exposure. growth. And overall, the solvency ratio has been stable in that regard. Also the Q2. number, as we mentioned, should be fully in line with that. So nearly no volatility. whatsoever.. The low interest rates, yes, of course, we have seen what has been happening to the. valuation reserves. And I would expect, also the interest rates being rather low for quite. some time. Did that -- it hasn't changed the composition. Of course, we also look at the. entry levels of the listed equities portfolio. We are not there yet. But if we see more. significant reductions, we would revisit that. We have changed our barbell strategy, I think. we mentioned that before, to also invest across the board. So in that regard, I do not. foresee any drastic changes of the portfolio. We have to reflect these developments in. our reinsurance pricing. And up to now, as we see contribution from portfolios like private. equity or real estate have been good. So we have on the agenda to increase that. But as. we mentioned, also 1percentage point up means that I have to invest another EUR 0.5. billion. And we will make sure that we have the same quality as before. So of course, yes,. we look at it. But no drastic changes anticipated.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous.. Andrew James Ritchie. Just a couple of points of clarification. Ogden, we actually now have an Ogden rate set.. So I'm confused why you wouldn't release that buffer. How can you justify holding the. buffer? I appreciate you said that the buffer went down a bit versus what it could have. been. But surely there are grounds for actually releasing it now that there is a statutory. the conversation is that we should assume no further drag from Australia. And also,. whereas you would have expected EUR 50 million of recaptures in 2019, that's no longer. finally, I think you said that low cat pricing went up at midyear. It didn't really go up enough. pricing increase wasn't quite enough. It's -- maybe just clarify.. Yes. So maybe, I'd take Ogden and then leave. Andrew, we -- you might remember that. when this surprising decision was taken to go down to the minus 74, there was a drag of. some EUR 300 million. And we mentioned, we take that out of the reserve redundancies. because this is why we have them, especially in such a long tail line. We have always been. mentioning that if that goes away. And we anticipate it a little bit more to go away, we will. most likely kind of give that back. So it is a switch in our reserves from, let's say, case. reserves to an overall IBNR of a very long tail line. So in that regard, to hurry up now with. the decision taken to do something, to release the case reserves and revisit the overall. ultimate loss ratios for that segment, I think we just save that for year-end. I think the. important message still is the contribution from that to the reserve redundancies is a little. bit less than expected because we anticipated something in the plus range. On the other. hand, there is no additional reserving necessary. I think that is in line with what we said. before.. Andrew James Ritchie. But sorry, that would fully imply the redundancy overall has gone up since year-end '18. I. appreciate it's gone up by maybe less than your hopes. But it is now a redundancy,. whereas before it was case reserves?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. In that regard, we should bear in mind that some of the minus 74 basis points had,. especially in the Willis Towers Watson analysis by year-end already been anticipated or. regarded as redundancies in their calculations.. Maybe on the U.S. side. I guess, in one of the former call, we mentioned that we'd expect. recapture charge of about EUR 45 million for 2019. This is part of our forecast. And this is. partly one company recapturing and an awful lot of others, which have already recaptured.. But did that on the anniversary day of the policies. So this is creeping in over couple of. months till a full year is over and then all these policies are recaptured. But this was part of. the 2019 forecast anyhow. So this is completely in there. Then there is the.... Andrew James Ritchie. So none of this happened to date, for the half year?. Roland Helmut Vogel. The creep in the recaptures on the anniversary date happen month-by-month. And we. are finalizing currently the recapture with one of the clients, which leaves probably 4 which. go into arbitration. And the point I made was that we have to account for these 4. companies the way as if we would not have increased the rates. So we will account for. losses in the rest of this year for these 4 companies and next year. And the recapture. charges we would have are basically at the same order of magnitude by the end of next. year when I hope that the arbitrations come to an end.. And if we win the arbitrations as expected, then we will get reimbursed for all the losses. we will have shown in 2019 and '20 under these treaties, which will basically balance the. recapture charges we have in our old accounting system. So instead of waiting for -- okay,. if these companies recapture this business at some point in time, later if they lose the. arbitration and then you have to show these losses, my point was we will show these. losses continuously over the next 18 months and then it will be a wash, just because we. have do the accounting this way.. Sven Althoff. Andrew, on the U.S. net cat side, when Jean-Jacques mentioned that we have not. changed our risk appetite, he did not want to imply that we have not written any. additional limits after the rate increases. So as to Florida, we have seen increases in the. low double-digit range and we have written a little bit more limit. But we are talking low. double-digit million levels. So we have not fundamentally changed (our outlook) for. Florida. And we continue to be underweight in Florida.. Where we have written a little more but still only in the double-digit million range of limit is. in California, where, due to the wildfires, we had much more significant rate increases.. And in our view, this was not only reflecting the fact that we had losses two years in a row.. But it's also to be explained by the uncertainty whether the models looking at the. California wildfire are still fit for purpose given this -- the increase in frequency. So that's. why the increases were more significant there and we wrote a little more. But again only a. couple of tens of millions.. Andrew James Ritchie. Great. So there was a question on Australia and whether it's truly one-off.. Klaus Wilhelm Miller. We have one-off in Australia, which is basically driven by the Royal Commission and the. impact this investigation had on the total market. You probably have seen similar negative. results with our competitors, plus a small correction of an accounting error from 2017.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. Just more -- a few clarifications, if you don't mind. So a few questions, please. Just with. Jebi, I seem to remember the conversation in 1Q, where the suggestion was that the. close to EUR 48 million or EUR 50 million taken was also sort of discretionary or that was. the suggestion. And now we have another EUR 50 million. Is this also in a similar vein. would you say, that you didn't really need to but you did it because of conservative. approach? So that's first question on Jebi.. Then just a clarification on reserves base. You mentioned, Roland, that the reserve. redundancy is unchanged despite EUR 230 million of 1H unused cat budget? Is that to. assume that there is some change in how you view risk on these kind of net cat losses?. Or is it just the way you account things? Then I have a question quickly on the life, very -it's not technical question, just an accounting thing. The funds withheld investment income. at EUR 23 million for the quarter, one of the lowest prints probably in the recent year. history. Is there something that has been given up? Or is there something to note there?. And yes, actually that's my last question.. Yes. Vinit, Thank you. Obviously, we have to clarify a few things this time. You mentioned. Jebi, I'm not fully sure if I understood everything. You mentioned that the EUR 58 million in. market loss, which was just not foreseeable, something extraordinary. We are not alone in. the world.. As I mentioned before, this has now fully exhausted the limits we have outstanding. We. are touching and scratching the hold account protection. So it was a little bit more, of. course, as we had expected by the year -- by the end of the First Quarter, otherwise, we. would have reflected that beforehand. But the only thing, again, I can mention is this is. now on a net basis. This is it. On the reserves, this is really in line with the strategy we. have been -- or the policy we have been applying for years. Unused large loss budget. does not increase the reserve buffers in any way.. We assume that these losses have already been occurred, other -- it's just that we don't. know about them or they will be occurring until year-end. So this would not increase our. buffers and has never before. So this is really part of the policy. We would not look at it.. With regards to the funds withheld, I think we've mentioned all the time that this is really a. reflection of the conditions of larger contracts. So in that regard, we have nothing special. that we don't do anymore. So obviously, some of the contracts where we had these. conditions have been running off. And for others, we have other conditions.. We look at the profitability of these contracts anyhow together with the interest on funds. held, together with the technical results. So there is, from our point of view, not any. significant change in the business mix. It's just that, obviously, some of the larger contracts. with that arrangements are no longer in existence.. Klaus Wilhelm Miller. One thing has changed, I would have to check that. But my strong guess is that this is still. related to project cadence last year because we have restructured a lot of the U.S.. business, not only between Ireland and Bermuda but also with some of our clients who's. ceded business straight to Ambernath America and Bermuda instead of Ireland. So this is. the most likely explanation for this change. But economics haven't changed.. Operator. The next question is from Andreas SchÃ¤fer, Bankhaus Lampe.. Andreas SchÃ¤f er. Just 2 questions, one is also on the investment side. Could you give us some sort of. rough indication, what kind of reinvestment yields you can achieve if rates are not going. up from these sort of levels? And the second question is on your guidance or your. outlook for 2019. I mean you have not changed your premium growth guidance. It's still. single digit. Is there any specific reason why you have not changed it now? I mean it looks. like -- I mean it should be well in the double-digit range.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think from the reinvestment yield, I will give you, as. always, the details as part of my presentation of the Investors Day in October. If I just look. at the fixed income portfolio, we should assume that as compared to last year. And of. course, also there, we have been moving parts. This is -- so we've lost 30 to 40 basis. points in our reinvestment yield. Yes. We will have again significant impact from those,. asset classes not so much affected but I think this is what we have to expect. So when we. had been at 220 basis points for the theoretical reinvestments, you know how I usually. present that, we might have lost around 40 basis points and be at 1.8, 1.7 in that case. again. But this will, of course, then dilute into the ROI, as we have presented before. And. there will be no desperate decisions to make up for them. We just have to live with that to. some extent.. the guidance at the beginning of the year entirely. Yes. There are indications that we. should be in the double-digit range. And if we look at the projections for year-end, we. mentioned before that especially from the proportional business from the beginning of. the year, this might go down slightly. There was one accounting effect from a structured. reinsurance contract. So in that regard, yes, our estimates for year-end are still in the. double-digit range. But it was a decision not to touch the guidance from the beginning of. the year at all.. Operator. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger, Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. I have 2 questions. My first question is on your renewals outcome on the 20% premium. increase. As most of your competitors also break down the price component in this, could. you also give some sort of guidance at least on where you see yourself in terms of pricing. outcome for this combined July renewals portfolio?. Then secondly on your ordinary investment income, you saw a significant increase in Q2. also on a half year basis. In your comments, you pointed to rise in ordinary income from -also coming from real estate and private equity investments. So if I look into the. contributions last year and also for the full year, then both real estate and private equity. had been a similar contribution level. So the question is on whether you can break down a. little bit more or shed some light into the ordinary investment income, where it came from. and what was sort of one-off and what is really ordinary here?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. If I start with the latter and leave the rest to you. But again I was mentioning the real. estate and the private equity, not to say that there was anything extraordinary but there. was, again, this over-proportional contribution from that side. There was nothing. extraordinary in there. And there was also nothing, I think, last year. The increase in. ordinary, I think, it really reflects the additional volumes. So it is from our fixed income from. the diversified fixed income book. It is the -- I think we -- and I mentioned before that, yes,. we do still see dilution of the ROI based on the lower reinvestment yields. But this should. be compensated by increased volumes and exactly that had been happening. So it's. really nothing extraordinary, no changes. It's just driven by the volumes and the absolute. numbers go up even if the ROI goes slightly down still, which was not, to such an extent,. the case. Then I would leave the renewal impact to you.. Frank Kopfinger. Just on this. So which otherwise would suggest that we could take ordinary investment. income for the first half also as a run rate for the full year?. Roland Helmut Vogel. Yes.. Sven Althoff. As regard to the movement on pricing, we are not doing the same full exercise we do for. the 1/1 renewals during the reporting period, only roughly 15%, 1-5, of our business, this is. up for renewal. So from a statistical base point of view, it's not as significant as our 1/1. renewals.. Nonetheless, we, of course, follow the various price movements. So what we can see for. the reporting period that for the entire portfolio, we have seen stronger momentum on. pricing compared to what we reported at 1/1, which was at 0.9% at the time. And overall,. it's around the 2%, slightly above 2% range. We could observe at the renewals we are. reporting on today with slightly better movement on the nonproportional side compared. to the proportional side. But both sides are up. So the 2% would be ballpark-ish, the figure. that we can report.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC.. Thomas Fossard. Two questions from my side. The first one will be on the operating cash flow Q2. So the. 821 it seems to be a big number, Q2 standalone. So just wanted to better understand. what was driving this? And what was the full year expectations? And maybe to connect. this question with the previous one from Frank, the figure on the ordinary investment. income that we should foresee.. Second question would be, I would say, more a -- I mean, to better understand this. dynamic -- pricing dynamic in the market currently. It seems to be that commercial lines. across the world are, I would say, increasing, price increases much stronger than in the. reinsurance segment at the time being. I mean we've seen some numbers yesterday. showing plus 6% price increase in commercial lines on a global basis. So how should we. interpret this? I mean is that normal that commercial lines are going up much more. significantly than reinsurance? Or is this just a question of lag effect in times and we. should expect reinsurance to catch up more or less with kind of -- with the price. momentum we are seeing currently in commercial lines? Any sense of why this is the. case? And why we should not expect, I would say, further momentum in the coming. quarters?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So if I start with the operating cash flow, Thomas, I have to admit I was a bit positively. surprised as well. If you look at statistics, which we usually see here on -- also on the slide,. the cash flow numbers per quarter have been volatile in the past as well. This might also. be the case because sometimes you get accounts before the quarter. And these are. largest -- this might have an impact on -- so in that regard, I would really look by the end. of the year to one more time, see as to whether there have been movements between. the quarters in-between.. I'm not saying that I don't believe the numbers but we should be a bit careful here.. On the other hand, of course, this is -- if you grow in P&C by -- it's percentage points,. then of course that is associated with premium within and reserves up for that premium.. And that then also is reflected by the increase in cash flow and the increase in assets. under own management.. Thomas Fossard. If I remember, well, actually, this cash flow is more driven by excess outflows business and. proportional business. So would that imply that actually your growth on pure XL business. has been stronger in Q2?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. No. I don't think so. You're right. I think the effect -- the cash flow effect from the. nonproportional business because you get your minimum and deposit premium at the. beginning. And in a lot of the larger, also, financial reinsurance contracts, you get a half. year account and that deducts then losses and commissions already from the premiums.. No. I think this is not the case. It is really the strong growth in P&C.. And again as I mentioned, we will have to look at year-end. It will be an increase. And we. positively look at that. And it's good to see it now because you might remember that my. presentation at the last Investors Day was exactly around that, how the positive cash flow. then impacts the ordinary investment income. So we see that now. I would not totally then. double that number as an expectation for year-end. But again, the growth in P&C makes. itself felt. That then already is the impact on ordinary at -- in our forecast today, we really. see the dilution compensated by volumes and not an additional effect on it.. Sven Althoff. When it comes to the rate movements, you mentioned the figure of 6% for commercial. insurance, which, to my knowledge, is a U.S. figure published by one of the major broking. houses yesterday. It's in line with what we are observing. We are very much benefiting. from that through our proportional book of business and also through our facultative. business, where we are seeing similar or even higher rate increases. What you have to. remember when I mention 2% as an overall rate increase, this is always a risk-adjusted. figure. What's the 6%, I would have to look into the details. But I would assume it's not. necessarily a risk-adjusted figure.. So the 2% I mentioned for the entire portfolio is a combination of higher original rates,. lower ceding commissions we are paying to our ceding companies. But also our different. view on loss expectancy, which, given the losses over the last two years, from a general. point of view, is going up and it's eating against some of those positive developments.. The fact that the insurance rates are, from that point of view, going up maybe a little. quicker than the reinsurance rates right now is a normal development. This always very. much depends on how the major losses are distributed between insurers and reinsurers. given retention levels from excessive loss programs. So also the insurers or the primary. insurers are reacting to the results in their portfolios from those losses. So this is giving us. a good underlying message. Whether this turns into us sending a more bullish message. for the 1/1 renewals, that is, as I said earlier, much too early to tell. A lot will depend on. how the major losses will behave in the third and Fourth Quarter.. Operator. There are currently no further questions. (Operator Instructions) We've received a followup question from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. Just one quick follow-up. The U.K. life mortality assumption changed, as you mentioned.. Please could you just comment a bit because I'm not -- so apologies, I'm not a U.K. life. fan. But it seems that some of the U.K. life companies have been taking benefit from. mortality improvements in recent few reporting periods, maybe a couple of years. Are. you saying that trend is changing in your view? Or just any color would help.. Roland Helmut Vogel. No. The change, what we have done here, the reserve strengthening was for one. outgoing retro deal. We had a major overhaul of our assumptions in 2017. And we. changed all our modeling from some older simplified modeling to a more sophisticated. comprehensive model. And we have done that for all the incoming business at that point. in time. And now we have done it for our retro deals as well and very old retro deals.. Currently, we don't cede any business. I guess we stopped retro completely in 2014. And. we just updated the assumptions on the outgoing business and that was the reason for. the reserve strength. And it has nothing to do with the changes in the mortality. assumptions in general for the underlying business.. Operator. We haven't received any further questions. So I hand back to the speakers.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well thank you very much. So I'd just like to conclude. Thank you for the questions.. Generally, as Roland mentioned, here we decided not to change the guidance. Obviously,. for me personally, it was a little bit early, just after a few months, to review all the. indicators. We'll look at that ahead of Q3.. But generally, what I'd like to say is that I see a lot of prudence in all estimates. I see also. that the P&C numbers are including full budget for large losses. But we have a market. which goes in the right direction. We have momentum on pricing. I'm pleased to see that. the life and health in-force is on track in the U.S. We see some growth in financial. solutions, life. But also non-life. And generally, the reserving is extremely strong. So from. my personal perspective, we are really very much on track to meet or exceed the targets.. So my confidence level has increased significantly based on my initial months in the new. role. And I'm optimistic for Q3. So on that note, I'll close. I don't know if Roland has. anything to say. So I think I can close the call. Thank you very much for the questions and. the participation.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded.

21,"Welcome to today's Hannover Re International Conference Call on Interim Results 3/2015.. For your information, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call. over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much indeed. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for. joining the Hannover Re's conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, Roland Vogel,. and we are pleased to present to you the figures for the first nine months of 2015.. As you know, we put our strategy, and thus, are having long-term success in a competitive. business. The development of our business in the first nine months of this year reflects. the strategic model quite well. Our Property & Casualty business has been subject to. fierce competition during the entire period. In addition, the continued low interest rate. environment puts pressure on the earnings of our investments.. Nevertheless, we were able to increase the already good result of the previous. comparable period by another 13% to €786 million. This rather favorable result was driven. by continued underwriting profitability of our P&C business and the remarkable increase. of our investment income. In addition, the profit from our Life & Health business have also. increased.. We are quite pleased with our ability to grow our business both on the P&C, as well as on. the Life & Health side. Adjusted for foreign exchange rate, this has resulted in a 10%. growth of our gross premium income, which we believe shows that Hannover Re is well. positioned to be successful in the current difficult trading environment. The annualized. return on equity amounts to 13.7%, which continues to be well above the minimum target. despite the fact that the shareholder's equity further increased to €7.7 billion.. This increase was the result of the strong earnings in the first nine months which over. compensated the dividend payment, as well as the decrease in the OCI as a result of the. spread widening in respect of our corporate bond portfolio.. The book value per share stood at €64.15 at the end of September. The growth of our. P&C reinsurance business emanates from a number of larger transactions where, on the. one hand, we were able to provide cedents with customized reinsurance solutions and. where, on the other hand, we also achieved margins that are above our margin. requirements.. Furthermore, our expert teams in our agricultural and ILS department has been very. successful in growing their business. This overcompensated the decline in premium. income in some very competitive segments of the market, such as the aviation business,. some of our continental European business, as well as the offshore energy business.. The EBIT margin stood at 15.7% and the combined ratio at 95.5% for our P&C business,. which shows that this business remains to be very profitable. The major losses are. significantly higher than those for the same period last year. However, we still remain. comfortably within the large loss budget for the first nine months.. In line with our continued conservative reserving policy, we do largely carry the unused. large loss budget forward into the fourth quarter. The largest loss we have suffered in the. first nine months has been the Tianjin port explosion in China. This is €96 million net for. Hannover Re. We continue to see a remarkable low level of loss advisers with respect to. this loss so that our reserve is largely our own estimation based on the treaties that we. are writing which could be exposed to the event.. Our Life & Health business saw a further increase of the profitability, with the net result. increased by almost 7% to €178 million for the period under review. This result has been. influenced by a number of positive and negative one-off effects, which fortunately. balanced out each other quite well.. Whilst our financial solutions business continues to be very profitable, and we have seen a. remarkable improvement in our results from the Australian disability business, on the. other hand, we saw negative development of some of our U.S. mortality business where. we suffered a single large loss with a negative influence on our results to the tune of €21. million.. In addition, we saw some deterioration of our results from our Paris branch that historically. had been profitable. We have, however, good reason to believe that this is just a blip in. the performance of our Paris branch and that it will return to the normal level of. profitability next year. As we mentioned in our Investors Day, with effect from the fourth. quarter of this year, we were able through a particular transaction to reduce the collateral. expenses for our U.S. mortality business significantly. Furthermore, we were able to. implement some rate increases with respect to some underperforming in-force business.. This, of course, should result in improved results of our U.S. mortality business in the. periods to come.. The performance our investment is highly satisfactory. Despite the sustained low interest. rate environment, the analyzed return on investment under own management is 3.4%. On. this positive note, I would like to hand over to Roland, who will explain these figures to you. in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Good morning from my side, and thank you, Uli. As usual, I will keep my comment as. brief as possible and focus on the results for the first nine months as an update on what. should be expected. For year end, however, in a few cases, it does make sense to. comment on the development for the standalone third quarter. As already mentioned, we. continued to deliver strong premium growth in both segments, even taking into account. that roughly half of the growth is the result of the currency exchange rate movements.. Net income – net premium earned increased in line with the gross number by also around. 10% at unchanged FX rates and the retention stayed – stable at group level.. I will comment on the business segments, as well as on the investments in a few minutes.. On the group level, we can see that the other income line is surprisingly positive. This is,. as usual, driven by currency effect and already some impact of lower LOC costs. Interest. on hybrid capital, slightly below last year's level because the impact from the €500 million. bond redemption on June 1 is just starting to become visible in the figures.. For the full-year 2015 and even more so next year, this effect will increase and lead to a. reduction in interest payments. We should also benefit from more lower collateral costs. as Uli already mentioned. Overall, we are very satisfied with the results for the first nine. months with an EBIT margin of 11% and an increase in group net income of 13%.. The noncontrolling interest went down as our German subsidiary, E&S, was affected by. especially two storms, namely Niklas and Siegfried. And finally, at 26.5%, the tax rate is at. a level we should consider as normal.. On the next slide, if we look at the capital side, you can see the effect of the €500 million. perpetual bond redemption in June, and we have already previously stated that €1.5. billion of hybrid capital is now at a level that we feel comfortable with but, on the other. hand, provides remarkable headroom and flexibility to increase leverage if need be. The. shareholders' equity on the right-hand side of this slide has increased by 2.5%, mainly. driven by our strong earnings.. However, the increase by the end of the third quarter is only moderate because of the. dividend payment in Q2 as well as the decrease of valuation reserves in our asset base.. Still, our capital base is even higher as compared to the beginning of the year which. makes the ROE achievement, from my point of view, even more remarkable.. Cash flow continues to be very positive at €1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2015,. especially the third quarter standalone shows a remarkable cash flow of almost €1 billion.. Thereby, we caught up on the surprisingly low cash flow in Q2. As indicated already then,. some early cash outflows obviously cumulated with late inflows which makes the allocation. to quarters somewhat volatile.. And this time, Q3 might be a little bit inflated. But, overall, we do again expect the asset. base to grow sufficiently to mitigate decreasing yields in the asset portfolio. Assets under. own management increased by 4.1% to €37.7 billion. The negative effect from the. decreasing valuation reserves of close to €500 million in the first nine months was more. than compensated by a positive impact from FX rate and, of course, the positive cash. flow.. On the next slide, for the P&C segment, gross premium growth increased by a. remarkable 10%. Uli already mentioned the special areas of growth, mainly driven by a. number of individual transactions. Overall, rather pleasing that we continue to see solid. demand for high-quality reinsurance and services. At 6.7%, the currency-adjusted growth. in the net premium earned was a little bit less pronounced and that is mainly due to the. success of our ILS department in transferring underwriting risk into the capital markets.. At 7.3% of net premium earned, major losses were still below the budget in the first nine. months even though the Atlantic hurricane season has turned out to be very benign.. Again, so far, the large loss budget for the Q3 was fully exhausted on a standalone basis,. and this was due to the – especially the Tianjin loss and an accumulation of man-made. losses and some smaller cat events. However, the underwriting result increased. compared to last year and the combined ratio of 95.5% is again on a very good level and. below our full-year maximum target of 96%.. In line with our practice employed in the last years, we have kept our large loss. expectations within the reserves and that accounts today for roughly €80 million. And. apart from that, the run-off of the reserves was, as usual, positive but with no. extraordinary ifs worth mentioning.. The confidence level of the reserves should – fairly stable overall. Other income and. expenses improved compared to last year, and I've already mentioned that here,. currency exchange rates effect have contributed. Altogether with an EBIT margin of more. than 15% and net income increasing by 16%, the P&C segment again performed highly. satisfactorily against the backdrop of the challenging market environment.. The next slide, P&C results by line of business. This demonstrates that most of the lines. of business continued to show sufficient underwriting profitability. On the other hand, it. can be seen that margins are getting closer to their respective hurdles and that the cat. business with no losses is still a contributor to the overall result.. Continental Europe was impacted by a number of smaller loss events, particularly in. Germany, while aviation was also impacted by five large losses that occurred in the first. nine months. You can see the impact of the Tianjin losses and the earthquake in Chile was. mainly within the worldwide treaty reinsurance segment, although these losses have also. impacted other lines of areas, for instance, marine and facultative or the cat segment.. On the next slide, we can go through that one very quickly. As already mentioned, major. losses were above last year's level, but still below average, and budget attributable. entirely to the very benign first quarter. As mentioned, this means that the unused part of. the budget together with the planned budget for Q4 of around €170 million provides us. with a comfortable buffer and cushion of more than €250 million for any large losses that. might occur in the course of the fourth quarter.. After nine months here on the next slide, 24 major losses made it to the large loss list.. This shows that the frequency of large losses increased significantly in the third quarter,. although some of these losses actually occurred already in the first half and only made it. over the large loss threshold during the third quarter.. The impact from natural catastrophes, rather benign overall with the Chile earthquake. being the largest loss with a little bit more than €40 million for our net account and €285. million in total man-made losses on a very high level dominated by Tianjin. Based on our. initial estimates and Uli had already mentioned that this event will produce a net loss of. €96 million, but there is still significant uncertainty about the overall assessment of that. loss.. The top line development of our Life & Health business segment was very favorable with. currency-adjusted growth of 10%. Net premium earned increased by 14.3% as we slightly. increased our retention here. As in the previous periods, emerging markets especially. Asia have been a remarkable driver of that growth, but we also took advantage of. opportunities arising from improved market conditions in Australia as well as writing. addition longevity transactions mainly from the UK. With an EBIT of €246 million, the. overall profitability improved compared to last year, but as Uli mentioned, development. were rather buried within our reporting categories. The U.S. mortality business again. affected by some incidents within the third quarter. Here, we already mentioned as the. one single large claim, which did affect the U.S. mortality portfolio. On top of that and that. also already mentioned by Uli, France came in lower than expected.. The EBIT margin for mortality and morbidity at 3% below our 6% target, and that was. compensated by the margin five for financial solutions and longevity that stood at 9.4%. and shows the continuing excellent profitability of especially the financial solution. business.. Also, the result from the Australian disability business has improved substantially. On a. positive note, we have successfully implemented the additional measures to reduce. collateral cost, which should help in the future. Net investment income is very positive and. still benefits from the one-off effect of the first quarter. And besides the strong ordinary. income, also realizations have contributed to some extent. Partly, these were driven by. some turnover in the preparation for the change in balance sheet currency at our Irish. subsidiaries from the beginning of the next year.. This year or for the first nine months, we had a negative effect from our ModCo derivative. in the order of €19 million.. A brief look at the investments, I'm quite satisfied with the results for the first nine. months. Ordinary investment income came in at 3.3% on an annualized basis. This result. was achieved through the help of the overall increased asset value and increased. exposure to real estate and distributions from high yield funds. But, of course, the. ordinary result also includes the around €40 million effect from the Life & Health financial. solutions termination fee agreement.. Realized gains on moderate level slightly below the corresponding period of the last year.. The change in fair value of financial instruments mainly affected by the valuation of our. ModCo derivatives. The increase of the impairment line is the result of ordinary. depreciation on real estate, actual impairments again on a negligible level.. At the bottom of this slide, you can see that the effect that yields and wider spreads have. had on our valuation reserves, the absolute amount decreased by €440 million compared. to the end of the last year. However, given that there are still €1.8 billion in unrealized. gains and especially viewed from an economic perspective, this decrease or. development does not concern us too much.. If you further diversified the allocation of our asset to the individual classes of securities in. the third quarter, by moderately investing into a smaller equity portfolio, this now accounts. for 1% of the total assets under own management. In addition, we continued to expand. our exposure to real estate and increased the proportion of higher yielding bonds. somewhat at the expense of the covered bond bucket. At the same time, we increased. the liquidity of the overall portfolio by expanding our share of highly rated government. bonds.. And that I think concludes my remarks, and I leave the target matrix to you, Ulrich, as. usual.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. And the target matrix continues to show mostly ticks which is – shows. that the first nine months of 2015 were actually developing quite favorable for us. No. more said about that, and I will then go to the outlook immediately and this is actually the. outlook for the current year.. And as you know, when we have announcing the half year results, we increased our. guidance to around €950 million. The third quarter underlined the improved earnings as. compared to what we thought we could achieve at the beginning of the year and. therefore, we left the outlook or the guidance for 2015 unchanged.. If I look at the individual areas on our Property & Casualty business, you can see that the. overall expected profitability is above the cost of capital. In view of our financial strengths. and very good positioning, we are still encouraged to see quite a lot of business potential. particularly in Asia Pacific as well as North America, but also Latin America.. If you look at the individual segments, North America, as already said, is – we see good. growth and profitability. I have to say that the arrows that you see here are not currency. adjusted, therefore – I mean they almost all point to the upper right side. On a currency. adjusted basis, that would definitely be different on Aviation, where on a currency. adjusted basis, the income is actually down.. As I said, North America, also profitability is good. We see growth opportunities there to. our very diverse book of business with more than 600 clients. Continental Europe, much. more difficult. I mean, the competition into soft market environment means that growth is. not really there to any larger extent. Also here, the currency doesn't help because it's. largely in euros.. Profitability is also impacted by the soft market. So, we are slightly below as a cost of. capital and our expectation at this point in time.. Very contrary to that, Marine, largely in excess of loss account. Despite the Marine losses. you saw on the large loss list, it's still very profitable mainly because we still see very. favorable rates in the Marine excess of loss account particularly on the worldwide. accounts.. This is quite different to Aviation, the rates continue to slide. And if it continues like this,. we will have difficulties to find any premium in that line of business. So, that's a negative. development and the recent loss, which is not all that large, will not have any major. change on that.. If you look at the credit and surety, we are in a very good position there. We are among. the market leaders and have improved our market position in 2009, when we increased. our involvement and everybody else has been out of the business and that shows and. continues to show some good profitability of that business.. UK, London market and Ireland remarkably improved because in previous years, this was. somewhat difficult class. We had significant actions on our direct business, particularly on. the MGA side and that bears fruit. So things are looking a lot better there now.. Facultative, of course, like in the Worldwide Treaty, the large losses on the man-made. side shows some effects. The catastrophe excess of loss, very profitable as our cat and. this is of course a little bit of, if I may say, an unfair profitability that the reinsurance market. gets at this point in time because the profitability is significantly higher than it would have. been if we would have seen the expected losses in this class. And for structured. reinsurance, we see good profitable growth opportunity in that area and we expect that. to continue.. If I then come to the Life & Health business, we continue to see remarkably good. profitability on our financial solutions business, and this is not only due to the fact that we. had a positive one-off effect in the first quarter. We will continue to see good profitability. there and our teams are very successful in continuously producing new business here.. Longevity continues to be a growth area, even though the business has become a bit. more competitive. But I would say here the growth and the capacity that's applied to that. business is well met by the growth of the demand for that business.. On the mortality side, we believe that for the entire year, the profitability will increase. beyond what we have seen in these nine months. Reasons already mentioned. And. morbidity, some improved trend here mainly, as I said, from the Australian DII and TPD. business.. Well, that leaves me as usual to the guidance for next year, which we normally give and. we report on the nine monthly results. First, you might be surprised why we have an. increase in the large loss budget from €690 million to €825 million. Number of reasons. here. First and foremost, currency because a lot of the large loss exposure and the. expected large losses, of course, in U.S. dollars. And here, of course, I mean the 2015. budget was set up at the end of 2014, then of course the euro was a lot stronger than it is. now. So, this is the largest part of the effect.. Then we increased the large loss budget for the man-made losses because we have. seen an increased frequency of medium-sized man-made losses, which also has to do. with the fact that the increase of our P&C portfolio, of course, are aligned on the large risk. have also increased. Now, this is €65 million of said increase.. And then lastly, I mean our market share in the non-cat business is significantly higher than. our share of the cat business. And of course, therefore, we write a lot less cat business. than is offered to us. But of course, there's many opportunities that are available to us if. additional cat exposure coming with them.. That means that once we have not increased our risk appetite for cat, so the absolute. capital allocated to the property catastrophe business is unchanged in absolute terms. It's. decreased as a percentage of the overall economic capital. But the utilization, we expect. that to be higher than it was last year. So, those are the reasons for the increased large. loss budget.. Premium. There's a very high premium growth that we have seen in 2015. We expect for. 2016 more stable development and maybe even small single-digit reduction of the. premium income. One of the reasons there is China where we have surplus relief treaties. both on the P&C side that refers to motor business, as well as on the Life & Health. business that refers to cash financing business.. Surplus relief effect of these treaties under the C-ROSS solvency regime which is the only. solvency regime in China from 2016 onwards is significantly less, and therefore, we. expect reduction in that business which, in absolute terms, from a premium point of view,. can actually be certainly in excess of €200 million. That will, of course, to some extent. mask the underlying continued growth.. Investment returns 2.9%, 10 basis points less than we were announcing a year ago for. 2015 and that's of course has to do with the low yield environment.. Net income, we expect to be able to keep that stable. So, the group net income a year. ago, we were estimating €875 million. We then increased that to €950 million at half year.. We now feel for the coming year, we should be able to keep that on a stable level at – so. we, again, have a guidance of around €950 million.. Dividend payout ratio, 35% to 40% is our normal payout ratio that allows us to self-finance. our growth ambitions. However, as last year and maybe for 2015, the proviso remains that. if the market remains as it is, we will probably continue to manage the growth of the. capital with increased dividend payments as compared to the 35% to 40%.. That concludes our remarks on the nine monthly results. And we look forward to your. questions. Thank you very much.. Q&A. Operator. Thank you. Okay. The first question in the queue comes from William Hawkins of KBW. Go. ahead, sir. Your line is open.. William Hawkins. Hello. Thank you very much. Can you just be a bit clear about what's going on in your. French branch of your Life business? I thought at first I could ignore it, but now you've. been mentioning it on a couple of quarter. I'm really not quite sure what's going on there.. So, can you be slightly clearer about the French Life disappointment?. And then secondly, your other results in the non-life business has been bouncing around. because of FX. What is the assumption that you penciled in your €950 million for 2016?. So, what should I be putting in as the other result for non-life?. And then last one, I'm sorry, if I may quickly. You've been clear on the large loss budget. going up for next year. What does that mean for your expectation of the combined ratio. indication for your expectations for next?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if I take the question in the reverse order because the first one is the more difficult. to answer. Yes, I mean the combined ratio for next year, we expect that to continue to be. below 96% despite the large loss budget increase.. On the other income forex effect on the P&C side, we expect for 2016 neutral, as we. always do, because we're not expecting positive or negative forex effect there.. Therefore, asset includes the expenses for the company as a whole. We expect that. number to be negative.. William Hawkins. .. Ulrich Wallin. That would be negative small single-digit, around €20 million. I think that's what it normally. is.. William Hawkins. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Correct me if I'm wrong, Roland, on that.. Roland Vogel. Well, it might be a little bit higher. It should be around – well, let me just check, but it really. should be in the order below €50 million.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. On the French branch, I mean, three elements which have resulted in the unusually. negative results there because, as I said, I mean this has been a very profitable business. year-on-year. The business that we write in the French branch is Life business but it's also. Accident & Health business. And we have some treaties on the Accident & Health side. where we had some reserve strengthening necessary. This is one part of it.. And then, of course, as we mentioned in the second quarter, we have on the Life side in. the French branch, we had some treaty where we renegotiated the terms with our client. which led to roughly €10 million negative result for the quarter and of, course, also for the. nine months. But then, of course, we expect to fully recover in the coming years and more. actually because that was – I mean taking a hit for, I mean, second quarter with a view of. generating higher profit in the future.. That's basically it. And then also we write some French-Canadian business in our French. branch which we might put through our newly set up Canadian branch. And in that. process, we have had some true-ups and put more conservatism in the reserve in order. to give the Canadian branch a better start with the results in Canada.. That is what happened there. All of them are really one-offs and that's why we believe. that the profitability will be back to normal next year. I mean, the last five years, I would. say, the average EBIT that we have generated from that branch has been around €50. million and that's pretty much around where the plan is for next year.. William Hawkins. And where are we this year?. Ulrich Wallin. William Hawkins. Great.. Ulrich Wallin. But not drastically negative. But, of course, compared to where we were before, it's. actually quite negative.. William Hawkins. Yeah. Lovely. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Morris of JPMorgan Cazenove. Go. ahead, sir. Your line is open.. Edward Morris. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. The first is on capital and. capital management. Just interested in how your forecast for stable to small reduction in. gross written premium sort of changes the equation there? And whether it might make it. possible to return a greater proportion back for a special dividend this year. And also. could you just talk about what really are the constraints under consideration, is there a. solvency number that you're hoping to stay above or a particular buffer above your S&P. capital rating? That'd be helpful.. And the second and slightly related question is on hybrid capital currently at €1.5 billion.. You said you're comfortable with it but it could go higher in certain circumstances. Just. wondering what the circumstances might be to cause you to increase the hybrid capital?. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you. Well, I mean, I would say from an earnings point of view and a solvency ratio. point of view under all measurements, there is no restrictions in returning some capital. certainly through a special dividend. As Roland explained in detail at our Investors Day,. that's also true for the German GAAP result. So, I mean, it is the decision of management. manage the capital but there are no restrictions from a solvency point of view. Hybrid, I. would leave that to Roland.. As already mentioned, we have that flexibility upwards. There are two potential things. would be an interesting M&A opportunity, we mentioned that we are still interested in life. happen but if it happens, we would have additional financial resources available for that.. On the other hand, and I think I tried to explain that to the investors, they are for the last. year or even that year before that, of course, the use of hybrid and the increase of. leverage could optimize the cost of capital and thereby improve the ROE. So, additional. ROE pressure here. But that is something which we do not foresee right now, but these. would be two potential areas to deploy more hybrid capital – no fixed plan today.. Edward Morris. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Xinmei Wang of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.. Your line is open.. Xinmei Wang. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the combined ratio in. Continental Europe and that coming in – operated below cost of capital. Can you talk a bit. about any actions you're taking to improve that? Or is it just a sort of a case of accepting. that is a soft market and that ratio is going to tick up? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. No. I mean, we're not just accepting it. I mean that's why you see no growth in that area. I. mean, we are looking at segments where the problems arise. I mean, constant segment. of negative surprises, there's, for example, the French motor excess of loss business and. then we're just writing less of it, if at all.. large industrial property, we see, I mean, rather disappointing results; low rates, coupled. with frequency of medium-sized losses. And also there, I mean, we're just cutting back.. And therefore, the mix should improve. I mean, there are some bright spots as well. I. mean, if I look at the – I mean, UK motor business, it's pretty good. I mean, some of our. business in Eastern Europe is also doing quite well.. So, it's really necessary to constantly prune the business and then change the mix a little. bit. And therefore, I mean, it's important that we are not putting ourselves under. protection pressure there, which we are clearly not. That's what we really try to do there.. Therefore, I mean, if the combined ratio would increase, it should be but – I mean, there is. considerable competitive pressure on that business.. Xinmei Wang. Okay. Clear. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Go ahead, sir. Your. line is open.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good morning. Three questions. First one will be on the French Life business, on the. life side. Could you comment if these negative results or I mean lower margin on Accident. & Health is coming from French ceding companies, or I mean this is coming from maybe. business you're being written abroad but booked in your French sub.. Second question will be related also to the life side and on the outlook. You provided a. strong pipeline for financial solution things. Could you remind us what is driving currently. this strong pipeline where obviously you're getting also a quite attractive margin at. present time?. And the last question would be related to your assessment of the Tianjin loss. Looking at. the numbers provided this morning, obviously, you're coming to issue 1.25% of your. shareholders' equity at the end of June, that is 0.75% for Q3 and 0.5% fourth quarter. So. the question was, I mean, for your Tianjin loss, have you picked up some compression risk. that you may have underestimated on your book? And also, could you tell us a bit more. which lines of business of your book has been impacted by this €96 million, the euro net. loss? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you very much for those questions, Thomas. Well, I mean, the A&H losses that. we have seen in the French branch is largely a French theme. It's not a theme from. abroad. And so it is, I mean, rather shorter term business, I would say. So, I mean that's. why it's not kind of like the Australian DII, I mean, they've got very long durations. That's. not the case here. Therefore, it's a little bit like a non-life correction in loss reserves.. Unfortunately, the underlying profitability and margins in the non-life are a little bit higher. than Life & Health. Therefore, it's more visible on the Life & Health, I would say.. On the pipeline in the financial solutions in the U.S., I mean, it's various factors. I mean, we. had a little bit of a first-mover advantage on that business in 2008 when financing of. redundant loss reserves became very expensive due to the financial crisis. We offered. tailor-made solutions for our clients which were very attractive to them.. And that, of course, means – because all these deals have to be run by the local. authorities and supervisors and as we have quite a lot of experience gained on that. I. mean – so the uncertainty, if people come to us, it's relatively high because we already. done a large number of them. And there's further demand for those.. And also, I mean, some of these deals come in connection with M&A activity where there. is an interest to get more certainty on the future cash flows or to monetize the future. cash flows in order to facilitate those kind of M&A transactions.. So, I mean, it's just for us, at this point in time, a very good business. We take very low risk. provisions on them. And for that, we get very good margins, some in the year. Return on. capital applied to that is extremely favorable. So, that is very positive at this point in time.. And then for the Tianjin loss, I mean, as I said, it's very difficult for me to comment. whether we are, I mean, overweight on that loss or not if I compared with my peers. What. I can say, I mean, our loss, the largest part of it is property business where we write. Chinese property treaties which are largely being ceded on a surplus basis. Our lines on. those treaties are, in general, between 3% and 5%. So, you can see that we are not. terribly keen on them. And, therefore – I mean the only – in our estimation, we only take a. The second largest part that we have is, of course, marine where the uncertainty is the. highest because we haven't got loss advisors really here. And this is more from. are a lot higher. I mean, like on all the specialty lines, we have higher lines than on the. property business in China that have to do with our judgment on the rating quality of that. business in China.. So on the marine side, I mean, say on a marine program, say, either from the land market. or say also from a Chinese domestic, we were probably right more like 15% to 20%, whilst. on the property programs, we write 3% to 5%, and therefore, the second largest we. assume under the marine line.. And then, of course, we have some estimations on property business from, say, Japan,. Germany, U.S. where we just expect that there will be some knock-on effects and we will. see some losses. Needless to say that this is an estimation of our sense that we haven't. got advisors there.. But that's how we go about this loss. I mean, this is an exercise which is not top-down. It's. bottom-up. The underwriting department's looking at what they have written and then. they came up with an estimation. And they also come up with – I mean, best case, most. realistic case, and worst case and the reserves that we put up, that's between realistic. and worst. So I mean, that's how we go about it. But we will know – hopefully have a. clearer picture at the end of the fourth quarter.. Thomas Fossard. Maybe one small question maybe for Roland just to come back on the fin solution under. Life. I think that at the end of Q, you indicated that the financial solution contributed to. €125 million to the EBIT in the first six months. Can you update what this contribution. number will be on a nine months basis? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. I must admit I don't have that. If we do that together – but it is – from the U.S., I think we. gave a number, it was combined financial solutions around the world. I have the U.S.. number here available which is €110 million, so it should have increased slightly from that. number, but I would have to come back to you with a concrete one.. Thomas Fossard. Thanks, Roland.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from In-Yong Hwang of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your. line is open.. In-Yong Hwang. Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. One on your German GAAP earnings. Maybe. discussed this in quite some detail at the Investor Day but if you look at kind of the. equalization reserve and your very helpful disclosure that you're getting €68 million out of. it this year, that's a swing of more than €300 million compared to last year.. And given you have a pretty much a good track record paying up most of your disposable. profit in the German GAAP as dividends, is that the kind of increase that we should expect. from your dividends – total dividends or are you going to keep it roughly in a similar region. to where you were last year in terms of dividends?. And second question is a very simple one. On reserve releases in P&C, maybe if you can't. give an exact number whether it's roughly in the ballpark of the €50 million quarterly. number that you guide to. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, to the dividend level, I mean, of course, it's always – I always hesitant to talk about. dividends before the year is over because, as you know, in reinsurance there's always –. the year. But as I said for the time being, I would say, all things being equal, we would. probably be looking for the same level as we have seen in 2015, which means that we. would not use up all the flexibility that we will see from the U.S. GAAP earnings this year.. And because – I mean we're, of course, concerned to see single years attractiveness of. the dividend, but of course, we also are concerned with the continued and future. attractiveness of the earnings. And so, we have to weigh both of those goals and put. them in harmony, I would say.. Roland Vogel. With regard to the reserve releases, I can just briefly confirm that we have seen a positive. run-off in the order of the expected, which – and you referred to the €50 million per. quarter, €200 million per year – so, we are within that ballpark with no extraordinary. effects on the combined ratio from reserve releases.. In-Yong Hwang. Great. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Broadfield of Barclays. Sir, your line is. open.. Andy D. Broadfield. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, actually. On investment income, it. looks to me that you're still extending the barbell approach. Is that a fair conclusion. because actually, the real estate business, I don't think actually went up that much this. year. But I'd still ask if you can just cut down – conceptually just agree or disagree with that. conclusion.. The second is you mentioned based on the net to gross ratio so there has been some. success on the ILS side. Does that include the – is that for your own book or is this for your. businesses for client so, effectively you're just putting it through to – I guess has this gone. into your K program or has this gone into do something else on the ILS side? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if I start with the ILS side and leave the barbell for Roland. Well, no, this is not for our. own books. This is basically tailor-made solutions for investors where we marry up the. need of our clients, the ceding company that they are sourcing with a structure that helps. the investors to take that risk. Our own risk position on that side is very, very low and. we're doing that really for fee income. And that has been quite good.. As you know, it has been publicized in the second quarter and third quarter. We. transformed 3.5%, I would say, because one was a smaller one, cat bonds into the year,. into the capital market and Texas Wind Pool being the largest. And that actually. generated, of course, fee income for us. It also generated growth and ceded premium. for us, but it's strictly on a back-to-back basis.. Andy D. Broadfield. And does that basis risk on those – I assume you'll be indemnified?. Ulrich Wallin. We are indemnified – the risks that is there, I mean the structures that we are offering, the. investment funds, gives them some leverage which, of course, they are not getting for. free. This is due to the structures that this is the way these things are set up. And. therefore, I mean, it's attractive for them. It's attractive for us because we get a good fee. for it. And as it appears, because I mean our clients like it as well, it's also attractive for the. ceding companies.. Roland Vogel. And with regard to the investment strategy, Andy, you are correct. We are continuing with. that investment strategy. If you look at the development of the government bonds here. from 21 to 25, I think that would even exaggerate the impact of the strategy a little bit. because in preparing also the changes in Ireland, we have parts of monies here or there,. so this is always also an impact you have on a balance sheet date. Because usually, it. takes – or the expectation would be that it takes a little bit longer. We will continue with. new investment according to the strategy, not sales.. So, you see that the government bucket increases. You see that also the non-investment. grade increases by a percent. The percent doesn't sound a lot. It still reflects €370 million.. In that regard, it is money which has to be moved. The same is true for the investment. policy showed what we have and what we are going to do at the occasion of our. Investor's Day. Also that will take a while as mentioned if you see the 4% line year, if it is. 3.6% or 4.4%, it could already be €350 million additional investments within that. So, it will. take awhile. We continue doing that and the number of the govvy development is even a. little bit exaggerated because it takes a little bit longer to get that moving.. Andy D. Broadfield. Okay. And then the government bonds, there's nothing unusual in terms of the trying to. find high yielding government bonds out there of EMs or anything?. Roland Vogel. No.. Andy D. Broadfield. No, okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Go ahead, sir. Your. line is.... Kamran Hossain. Hi. Morning. Two questions. The first one is just on the 2015 guidance. So, you've set the. €950 million net income for 2015, but you're already at €786 million for the nine months?. Can I just kind of square off, let's say, whether this is – you've been highly conservative on. that €950 million number or are there some horrible impacts from, I guess, either VW or. the recent kind of Russian plane going down that we should expect in Q4. So, that was. the first one.. And the second question, the segment guidance for next year that you were seeing flat. combined ratio which I assume because prices have come down that actually were going. to some of your reserve buffer to manage through to that flat combined ratio. Could you. just give us some idea what the €950 million guidance for 2016 looks like if you don't take. that buffer down? And if I'm completely wrong in that assumption, just say no. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the guidance for 2015, of course, it's not a point estimate. I mean, we say it's. around €950 million. And this can, of course, be – also as it looks can be a little bit higher. I. mean that's not entirely out of the question. No, there are no negative developments so. far that we see in the fourth quarter. The plane crash in Russia will unlikely make it to the. large loss list, the way we look at it right now.. VW, I mean, we don't think that even if worst comes to the worst and then I would have. probably not explained that in great detail because I think I mean as we have no. facultative lines in these, I don't think our ceding companies will be terribly keen on me. trying to explain liability losses on VW. But no, I mean we don't see that, in any way, shape. or form, have an extraordinary negative impact on our result.. The combined ratio for 2016 being flat, I mean, that would, of course, mean that the. confidence level movement would be less positive, let's put it that way, than in 2015. because you are very right. I mean the rating quality of the book in 2016 will definitely be. worse than the rating quality of our book in 2015. And this is unfortunately the case. because we can't walk on water. I mean it's really – I mean it's the fiscal year and of course. the fiscal year 2015, we still have the benefit from 2013, which was still a very good year,. and 2014. And of course, I mean we're being a lot less pronounced than 2016.. So, yes, I mean if you have the €825 million large losses, which the €950 million assumes,. we expect that we will eat into the confidence level to some extent. Not a great deal, but. to some extent. I mean at the same time, of course, equally important if that we not make. too many mistakes in our underwriting and not creating any negative writes from single. large transaction that's why we're very careful with these. But yes, I mean, it will partly be. supported by the level of confidence. I mean that's the reason why we build it up so. significantly over the last few years, and I think that's very much in line with what we said. all along.. Kamran Hossain. Just a follow-up on that. Would it be possible to get an idea what the €950 million might. look like if you won't be eating into the confidence level, or is that overly complicated for. this conference call?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. I think that's a good way outlet you gave me there. But I will tell you at the end of. the – when we publish our 2016 numbers.. Roland Vogel. Yeah. But Uli, I think that the one indication one could give is it should be within two. combined ratio points.. Ulrich Wallin. That's absolutely true. And of course, it depends also a little bit on the large losses. I. mean if nature is nice to us again and we don't have the large losses, of course we don't. have to eat in the confidence level. But that's, of course, we cannot assume. I mean we. assume the expected losses.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks very much. I'll follow up in 2016.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Michael Haid of MainFirst Bank. Go ahead. Your line. is open.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Michael Haid, MainFirst. Actually, just a follow-up question on the. confidence level. Did I understand right, did you increase the confidence level so far in. 2015?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, we expect that it has stayed stable.. Michael Haid. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. Of course, only the full actual analysis would show that because, as I explained previously,. I mean, redundant loss reserves are not really tangible asset because they are the result. of a calculation. And of course, if you look at the calculation at the end of 2014, it has. certain assumptions on paid losses and loss advisers in 2015. And of course, then at the. end of 2015, it's maybe a new calculation that takes that into account as – of course and. then the actual. And then of course, the actual will also have an effect on the expectation. for 2016 and beyond. Therefore, I mean, it's not as tangible as you think. But I mean it can. go both ways. But from what we have seen so far in 2015, we expect it to be stable.. Michael Haid. Okay. May.... Ulrich Wallin. Stable means it can be €100 million either way, I should say that.. Michael Haid. Okay. And then I have two questions. One is on the Tianjin. The gross loss is €112 million.. The net loss is €96 million. Just for curiosity, what retro cover do you have in place which is. responsible for the delta because, to my understanding, the K program does not cover. any of this difference?. And the other question is equity investment. I've seen you have increased them in the. third quarter. That was already indicated at the Investors Day. Is it only on an opportunistic. basis or you plan to do more of this increase? And I noticed that you have not booked any. in Life & Health any equity investments. Is this a – does this have economic implications or. is it just completely discretionary accounting?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the Tianjin loss gross to net, it is actually the K facility because the K facility takes. all our marine excess of loss portfolio. And the difference, of course, comes from the. marine side.. Michael Haid. Okay. That's it.. Roland Vogel. Yes. With regard to the equity portfolio, as already indicated, we had invested that 1. percentage point. Yes, they are longer term. This should be seen as an entry. We feel. comfortable it has, of course, up to now, developed nicely, very volatile capital equity. markets. So, we do not see that growing now week-by-week. But longer term, we would. expect to use other opportunities to re-enter and potentially improve it .Other than that, it. is more opportunistically there.. So, if we feel it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep it, we would also sell it. But the plan. would be longer term, and longer term here now is again a few years that could increase. step-by-step. We did that only for the Hannover Re SE portfolio. Here, out of Hannover,. for the Hannover-based Life business, there are not a lot of assets available as such. In. that regard, this is not discretionary. It is a reflection of the entity investing. And here as for. the German-based Life business, assets are usually funds withheld. In that regard, the Life. segment does not own a lot and this is why these were allocated only to the P&C. segment.. Michael Haid. Okay. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research. Go. ahead, sir. Your line is open.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. Just a quick question on the Life margins by product. I'm looking – there's. mortality/morbidity versus financial solutions and longevity. So by the nine months, the. mortality/morbidity margin improved quite a lot from the half year. So, does that actually. imply despite the French issue and U.S. large loss, the mortality/morbidity still improved Qon-Q?. And then – or maybe is the French issue impacting the financial solutions/longevity result. or did something happen in financial solutions or longevity in Q3 that took the margin. down sharply, still well above your target, but it's sharply down Q3 versus the half year? Is. there any sort of color on that?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the longevity and financial solutions, of course, we had the one-off effect in the. first quarter.. Andrew J. Ritchie. But even ignoring that, so it was 17% ignoring that one-off effect. At half year, it's now. down to 9%.. Ulrich Wallin. Do you mean in nine months? I was just going to say that of course, the one-off effect. that's been – brought it down a little bit. I mean, still, the 9% is largely stemming from the. financial solutions. Longevity, in and large, is in line with expectations but, of course, the. way we account the margin is a lot lower.. Morbidity and mortality, I mean, the French problem is in morbidity and mortality. It's not in. longevity, not at all. And therefore I would say – I mean, as far as the financial solutions go,. of course, I mean, the way the quarterly margins evolve can also be a little bit hit and miss.. But I mean for the entire year on the longevity together with the financial solutions, I. mean, we certainly expect somewhere like a double-digit margin.. Andrew J. Ritchie. For the entire – those two products together as well?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, yes, which, of course, is very attractive on the financial solutions and a little bit more. marginal on the longevity. The main reason for that is that the majority of our longevity. business are these pension block transactions.. In the beginning of the transactions, risk is very low because, I mean, we have the – and of. course, we guarantee the pension payments. So, I mean, now, our loss payments are the. actual pension payout for fixed premium.. But of course, in the early years, we expect not many of the pensioners to die. Therefore,. the probability of the deviation from the expected payout to the actual payout is very,. very slim. And as a result of that, the way we collect the margin is backloaded. And then. so, I mean after expenses, in the first few years of those, we only booked, I mean,. certainly less than 2% margin on those large deals and put the rest in reserve really.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. We feel that's a more prudent way to look at these things.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. And just one other question, to the extent you don't use the large loss budget on. P&C and obviously, currently €83 million roughly unused, would you let all of that flow. through to the bottom line in Q4 or I think, last year, you decided to keep some of it back?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean, it really depends on the overall situation that you're finding out. I mean some. of it will normally be kept back because I mean the way our reserving works is on an. underwriting year basis rather an accident year basis. It then gets translated into accident. year. That allows us some flexibility on the newest underwriting year to possibly keep. some back, but I mean we have to see on that one.. Andrew J. Ritchie",20151104_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2015-11-4_FS000000002238315625.pdf,2015-11-04
22,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re. International Analyst Conference on the 2019 Annual Results. For your information, this. conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques. Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you. to our conference call, presenting our results for the financial year 2019. As usual, I'll start. with a short summary before our CFO, Roland Vogel will go over the financials in detail.. And for the Q&A, I'm additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Michael. Pickel.. The initial slide of the deck shows you the key metrics for 2019. We're generally satisfied. with the business development. Last year, we had double-digit growth in earnings and. premium, and we're able to achieve a return on equity of 13.3%, well above our minimum. target. And it's particularly pleasing to see that the earnings growth kept pace with the. strong growth of our shareholders' equity.. Group net income increased by 21% to EUR1.28 billion, and this record result was based on. favorable underlying profitability and non-recurring items resulting from valuation gains. from two participations, which we mentioned in previous quarters: Viridium in Germany,. EUR100 million impact, and Skandia, a company in Scandinavia, EUR50 million impact,. positive for the result.. Gross premium increased by over 15% adjusted for currency, which was mainly driven by. P&C, where we saw an improving market environment. And P&C premiums were up by. 20% from both our traditional and structured reinsurance business.. The combined ratio at 98.2%, was above our target, due to the large loss activities last. year, which exceeded the budget and the development of Typhoon Jebi which we. reported on in the past year.. Earnings in life and health were very strong due to favorable underlying profitability and. better-than-expected U.S. mortality performance, plus the Viridium effect which I. mentioned a minute ago. Life and health growth was steady and came mainly from the. Asia-Pacific region.. The investment income was strong with a return on investment of 3.5% or 3.2% excluding. the one-off in life and health, significantly exceeding our initial expectations of 2.8%. And. the solvency ratio was at 252%, which was comfortably above our minimum target.. On Slide 4, you see the dividend development. And based on the strong set of results,. we intend to propose a total dividend of EUR5.5 per share, which will be equivalent to. EUR4 ordinary dividend and EUR1.5 special dividend. This dividend payout reflects the. company's strong performance and our net income growth in 2019. We continue to see. good growth opportunities this year and an improving price momentum, and part of the. earnings will be used to fund future growth.. Moving on to the financial figures for the full year 2019. Let's start with the cash flow. At. EUR2.5 billion, the operating cash flow is again very strong. And I'm pleased to add that. the underlying numbers are even better because we wrote a large pre-financing deal in. life and health reinsurance in the fourth quarter. This led to an operating cash outflow of. around EUR350 million and explains the relatively low number in the Q4 standalone view.. Such pre-financing is of course associated with future profits and respective positive cash. flows in future years if everything goes according to plan.. On the right hand side, you can see that it's not only the significant positive cash flow that. has led to 13% growth in assets under own management, additional factors contributing. to the growth were the lower yields and credit spreads at the end of the year, as well as. positive currency effects and the EUR750 million hybrid bond that we issued in Q4.. Overall, invested assets amounted to EUR47.6 billion at the end of 2019.. On Slide 6, most of the effects mentioned are also supporting the strong increase in our. capital base, as presented here, especially the green portion of our policyholders'. surpluse reflects the additional hybrid capital outstanding with the first call date for an. outstanding bond in summer. This might come down in Q3.. Nevertheless, the most important contributor to the 20% increase in shareholders' equity. is the strong result that we achieved in 2019. The contribution from the valuation reserves. in our asset portfolio even went up over the course of the first quarter this year and is. now being impacted by some volatility, driven by the lower interest rates but also higher. credit spreads as a reaction to the coronavirus.. The next slide shows the impressive long-term outperformance of our ROE target, but. also the consistent delivery in each and every year with 2019 being the 11th consecutive. year with a double-digit return on equity. Over the last 10 years, we have more than. doubled our equity base, and at the same time we were able to grow our earnings per. share by 5.8% on average per year.. Also in comparison to our peers in the reinsurance space, our return on equity is very. favorable with Hannover Re coming out on top for both the financial year 2019 and the. five-year average. Another point visible on this slide is that Hannover Re is outperforming. the industry in the years with below average large loss activity like 2015 and '16, and even. more markedly in very loss heavy years like 2017 and '18. This confirms the success and. profitability of the business model and our approach to managing the volatility of our. earnings by means of retrocession protection and conservative reserving.. With that, I would give the floor to Roland Vogel for more detail on the financials.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Good afternoon, and thank you, Jean-Jacques.. Let's directly move on to the group's figures for the financial year 2019. As usual, I will. come to the details in the segment reporting. But to sum it up. Hannover Rerecorded very. strong premium growth, driven primarily by our P&C reinsurance business, but also well. supported by life and health.. The group net income increased even more significantly by 21%. Admittedly the negative. effect from recaptures in 2018 on the one hand and two positive one-off effects in 2019. on the other played a part in the strong earnings growth. Nevertheless, we have. managed to achieve another record result, which is quite remarkable in particular against. the backdrop of the overall profitability for the industry, especially in light of the large loss. burden, which we will see in a minute.. Maybe worth mentioning on a group level, financing costs have increased compared to. the previous years. We issued the new hybrid bond in Q4 to potentially refinance a bond. with the first call date in September 2020. Still around EUR4 million of the increase is due. to the first time application of the new IFRS leasing standard, which led to the reporting of. such costs in the financing line.. Moreover, the tax rate came in slightly below expectation, which is to be attributed to the. nearly tax-free gains on the higher Viridium valuations as well as on another sale as JeanJacques already mentioned that of an agency with some EUR50 million and that was also. tax preferred. The latter amount is accounted for in the other income line as it is the result. of a de-consolidation exercise.. On the next slide, property and casualty, reinsurance gross written premium grew by. 20%, adjusted for currency effects stronger than initially expected going into 2019. Drivers. here, were the slightly improved overall market environment in the reinsurance sector and. very healthy demand for Hannover Re as a business partner. The growth was well. diversified by region and by line of business. It is worth mentioning that this year, the. contribution from the traditional lines was even higher than the growth in structured. reinsurance, which had been the driver in proceeding periods.. The increase in net premium earned was less pronounced mainly due to the change in. unearned premium, which is a normal phenomenon. When the book grows strongly, the. retention remains stable slightly over 90%.. Now large losses, was already mentioned came in EUR81 million above the full year. budget of EUR875 million, and on top of this negative development of Typhoon Jebi from. 2019 impacted the underwriting result by another EUR80 million. As such EUR160 million. translate into 1.3 combined ratio points. So one could argue that adjusted for them, we. would have achieved our 97% target. Still, we will have a look at the development of the. reserve redundancies in a second.. The budget overrun of the large losses was supported by the fact that two major events. occurred outside our defined risk peak or peak risk definitions, so that the release from. our retrocession program was less beneficial than in the last two years. Altogether, the. combined ratio came in at 98.2% and with that a little bit above our target.. Initial reserving remained conservative as usual. The runoff of our reserve was again. positive within the expected range but impacted by especially Jebi slightly lower as. compared to last year. When it comes to the current confidence level in our loss reserves,. we have to accept that also we were not totally immune against the developments from. U.S. casualty losses. Conservative past reserving made sure that we did not observe any. negative run of result, but based on initial estimates, reserve redundancies overall went. down by approximately EUR200 plus million. As you know final numbers will be presented. in October, so this is -- these are the first indications.. The negative experience here has already been reflected in our reserve setting for the. 2019 year and partially led to higher ultimate loss ratio assumptions for such segments. It. was mainly triggered by trends towards increasing healthcare costs as well as the opioid. crisis and the reopening of all sexual molestation cases. We have reported more than. once before that our exposure here should be limited as the majority of our highly. diversified portfolio has a focus on small and medium players in the U.S.. Apart from that, the somewhat unexpected decision to set the new opt-in rate in the UK. at minus 25 basis points, also had a negative impact on our reserve redundancies as the. reserves reflecting an opt-in rate below zero had been treated as redundant in the past,. which now up or down to minus 25 basis points had to be corrected.. Net investment in P&C increased slightly driven by the favorable increase in ordinary. investment income. Other income expenses include EUR49 million gain from the disposal. of our participation in the Swedish agency already mentioned. Apart from this, there are. no other material one-offs included in this line. Altogether, the EBIT margin is exactly in line. with our 10% target. The tax ratio was at normal level.. The next slide shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business, and here. the impact from large losses is quite visible. North America was mainly affected by. Hurricane Dorian. The Latin America reporting line reflects not only the riots in Chile, but. also worldwide agricultural business, because it's part of that business line. Here we have. seen losses from the bush fires in Australia and tornadoes in the U.S.. The cat XL segment includes a large part of the losses of the typhoons in Japan, and the. combined ratio for UK and Ireland also exceeds the target affected by rather weak. technical profitability of the Lloyd's business, which we support.. On the other hand, aviation and marine are significantly below target, benefiting from a. favorable loss experience as well as some positive reserve runoffs. Additionally, the. German speaking countries made a good contribution to the technical results.. On the next slide, we have already commented on the large loss situation. Net losses. totaled at EUR956 million, exceeding the budget by EUR81 million. As you can see the. difference between gross and net is smaller compared to the year 2017 and 2018,. because retro was a little bit less effective this time.. In the first place, this is because no individual loss was large enough to figure our whole. account cover. Secondly, it was due to a high frequency of manmade losses, which are. less protected by our retrocession program. The third reason is Hurricane Dorian where a. large part of the loss comes from proportional treaties, which are not covered by our KCession. And the same is true for the credit losses. Here Thomas Cook came in -- came. slightly down, but still led to a burden of around EUR85 million nearly gross for net.. Looking at the detailed list on the next page. The large events were Hurricane Dorian and. Typhoon Hagibis and Faxai on the nat cat side. However, the overall level of nat cat losses. were still within expectations. This means that the reason why the overall large loss. budget was exceeded are the manmade losses, and here a combination of frequency. and sizable individual losses like Thomas Cook or the riots in Chile, and the refinery loss in. the U.S.. So let's move on to our life and health reinsurance business. Gross written premium up by. 6.7%, adjusted for currency effects, which was within our expectations. The main driver. was new business written in China and Australia. Additionally, we were able to grow our. longevity book.. The results from the U.S. mortality business improved significantly and even slightly more. than anticipated. Here the absence of last year's recapture charges helped as well as. better than expected mortality.. In 2019, it came only to minor recapture charges in the first half year. A few remaining. open cases where the rate increases have not been accepted and the business has not. been recaptured by the client yet are in arbitration. This means that the business will. either be recaptured or the clients will accept the rate increases at a later point in time,. assuming that we arbitrate successfully. We do not foresee any significant impact on our. expected yearly results from such proceedings at least of today.. As already reported with our half year results, we had some negative effects from. disability income in Australia and we added some reserves for our UK business. In both. cases, we did not see any further material negative development in the second half.. Investment income increased significantly, supported by the EUR100 million one-off, as. part of the realized gains in the second quarter, while the change in fair value through P&L. was also positive.. Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution from. the financial solutions business, particularly in the U.S. for which a large portion is. recognized according to the deposit accounting method.. Altogether, the EBIT of EUR570 million is well above our EUR400 million indications even. excluding the EUR100 million one-off. At 16.4%, the tax ratio is below the normal level. driven by the tax privileged valuation gains.. On the next slide, in life and health, the 2019 financial year was very favorable in terms of. not only earnings contribution but also new business production. The value of new. business written in 2019 stands at EUR363 million, well above the target. The main drivers. are financial solutions and longevity. Additionally, our Shanghai branch was very successful. in writing new high-value business.. Coming to the investments, we are very satisfied with the development of our. investments in 2019. The return on investment is appreciably higher than our initial. expectations of 2.8%. And I'm very pleased that we were able to increase the ordinary. income compared to the already strong number in the previous year, resulting in an. ordinary return on investment of 3.1%.. The realized gains include the Viridium one-off and that is then boosting the ROI to 3.5%.. But even if we adjust for that and Jean-Jacques has already mentioned it, the ROI would. still be very strong at 3.2%. Realized gains in the second half were largely driven by the. disposal of two real estate objects. The positive change in the fair value of financial. instruments was an additional factor.. Unrealized gains increased significantly to EUR2.3 billion, mainly driven by lower interest. rates and reduced corporate spreads resulting in an increase in the valuation of our fixed. income portfolio. As of today and driven by the balance of interests going down and. spreads widening, the number should even be EUR1 billion higher than it was by the end. of the year.. On the next slide, you can see that our asset allocation remained rather stable. In 2019,. we have slightly increased our corporate portfolio and improved geographical. diversification of our fixed income book, mainly expanding our investments in emerging. markets, where yields are still a bit more attractive. The overall diversified contribution to. ordinary income is again supported by the good and very good results from real estate. and private equity, but not to any extraordinary extent.. Next, we come to the preliminary update of our solvency reporting as of the year-end. 2019. And even though the audit of the numbers is not yet final, we are -- we do not. anticipate any material changes and are brave enough to present them today. We will. publish the full reporting with all the detail on the 9th -- on the 7th of April, so I have to ask. you to be a bit patient on full -- until the full details are available then.. The capital adequacy ratio has increased to 252%, very comfortably above our minimum. target. According to our internal metrics, the ratio is even better. The difference here lies. in the treatment of minorities, where we still think that this is capital we can work with. The. regulator still takes a different view.. For the first time, we have applied the dynamic rather than the static volatility adjustment.. We expect to get regulatory approval for this model change within this or the next month.. But it had been agreed with our regulator that we can already use it for this reporting.. In contrast to the static volatility adjustment, the dynamic volatility adjuster is dependent. on spread movement for different economic scenarios instead of being static for all the. scenarios. This reduces our spread risk and has a positive impact on the owned funds.. The first time application led to an improvement of around 15 basis points.. Owned funds have also been benefiting from the additional hybrid capital of which. EUR500 million might be called in 2020. That accounts for another approximately 5. percentage points. So in aggregate, the ratio would have gone down without the two. one-offs. This should not come as a surprise as we have been growing, so remarkably. Still. the comfortable solvency leaves us room or leaves us the room we need to take. opportunities in the future.. On the next page, you can see that the composition of the capital requirements. Property. and casualty has of course increased as a result of the business growth, now representing. the largest share. The market risk has also increased with the growth of our asset base,. and a slightly increased risk appetite, but the use of the dynamic volatility adjustment has. had a mitigating effect here. The diversification effect has improved by 2 percentage. points and -- as compared to 2018 and now stands at 36%.. The next page, here are a few more details on the development of the capital adequacy. ratio over time. Apart from the additional EUR750 million in hybrid capital, the main drivers. for the increase in 2019 are as already mentioned, model changes and in this respect the. first time use of the dynamic volatility adjustment, as already mentioned. This brings us. then to the 200 -- over the 250% mark. This is in line with the 237% guidance provided at. our Investors Day in October last year, because the latter number only partially included. the EUR750 million of hybrid capital and the use of the dynamic volatility adjustment had. not been taken into account at that point in time.. We now come to the reconciliation of IFRS in the Solvency II owned funds as well as the. composition of the owned funds compared to the same picture of the previous year. The. adjustments for technical provisions have decreased significantly by more than EUR1. billion. This can largely be explained by a higher risk margin, especially for our life and. health business, and due to the decline in interest rate and the growth of the business.. I don't want to spend too much time on further details. The most important point is the. continued very high quality of the capital with 87% being Tier 1. The second important. takeaway is the high degree of flexibility with EUR1 billion of unused Tier 2 capacity still. left. Again details to follow early April.. I think this concludes my remarks, and I'd like to hand back to Jean-Jacques for the target. matrix.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much Roland. So target matrics 2019 on Slide 27. Most matrix are met or. exceeded. The target matrix generally confirms the successful strategy execution and a. favorable year 2019. Almost all targets are achieved, but obviously in P&C the impact of. the large losses is being felt on the combined ratio and the economic matrics.. Let me move to the outlook for 2020 on Page 29. You have an overview on our. profitability and volume expectations based on the favorable renewals at 1-1. We see. further growth opportunities in 2020 in most lines of business of our portfolio. Also the. overall profitability has improved compared to the previous year. All lines of business. earned the cost of capital or a good margin on top of it.. For natural catastrophe risk, we intend to increase our capacities only carefully under. selected programs with key customers. And the overall market environment remains very. competitive, and large losses and results of the reinsurance industry in the past three. years show that generally further needs to see some improving. Reinsurance rates is. clear.. On Page 30, you have the same overview for the life and health business. We also see. profitable growth in life and health reinsurance, mainly financial solutions and mobility. business. And overall we see particularly promising growth potential in the Asian market,. particularly China.. Profitability, as in P&C, is at or above cost of capital and our financial solutions business is. expected to provide us with continued excellent profitability, which leads me to the. guidance for 2020. The outlook for this year remains unchanged. We still maintain the. expectation of a group net income of around EUR1.2 billion, which is an increase of. EUR100 million compared to the initial expectations for 2019, if we remove the one-off. items mentioned earlier.. It's a bit early in the year given the uncertainties on the portfolio, on the renewals later this. year on the impact of the coronavirus on overall growth in the economy to move the. guidance. Obviously, we have some outperformance at 1-1 in P&C on the top line -- at the. top line level. But for the time being, we feel that the guidance should be maintained.. Before closing, just a few words on a very topical theme, of course, coronavirus. I'd like to. make a few comments on the current situation on that front and the possible impact for. Hannover Re. We obviously look into our own activities and business continuity measures. are in place across the company. But there is no indication currently for operational losses. or non-delivery of services. We have some local crisis teams, which are working in. different locations. Traveling and meeting activities are downsized. Employees in some. locations work from home, where needed and for other locations tele-working options. are planned upon certain triggers.. Current insurance losses are minimal. We didn't see any impact so far, but depending on. the further development of the crisis, we might see some losses emerging rather on the. P&C side than life and health due to the low number of insured debt and feasibilities.. For the same reason, comparability to pandemic stress test with its focus on excess. mortality is limited losses depends on the progression of event cancellations and supply. chain disruptions throughout the year. Our loss monitoring is ongoing and current. estimates are a bit speculative, but based on the initial analysis, the bottom-up from the. different experts, we see some exposure for contingent business interruption and event. cancellation in the order of EUR200 million.. Capital markets have shown strong reactions, of course. And currently as you know we. have practically no listed equities and therefore are, on that front relatively comfortable.. Up-to-date, there are no defaults in our asset portfolio and we continue to monitor. market and asset portfolio performance on a continued basis.. The mid- and long-term impact will of course depend on the level and duration of the. economic downturn. But at this stage from a pure reinsurance standpoint, I would say that. situation remains manageable.. With that, I'd like to close the presentation part of our session, and I invite you to. comment or ask any questions you might have.. Questions And Answers. (Question And Answer). Dear ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session.. (Operator Instructions) And the first question we received is from Kamran Hossain from. RBC. Your line is now open, sir. Please go ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, afternoon everyone. Two questions for me. The first one is just I guess it's on the longterm impacts of where rates have got to in -- over the last few months, few days. How. should we think about 2.7 moving to the level that you're kind of reinvesting at today? And. how many bps should we be taking off a year going forward? And then are there any. obvious actions that you can put in place to mitigate some of that impact?. And the second question slightly less number-y, but on Asia, you talked at the Investor. Day about kind of expanding your capabilities, growing the business out there, hiring. some people. Maybe could you just update on kind of how far you've got with plans, how. happy you are and kind of when we should expect some kind of further concrete news on. that? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. So I guess I should start with the rate environment. Not that we have not done any really. simulations of how many basis points we will lose. The reinvestment yields have of course. gone down on the one hand, because the -- especially the U.S. rates went down. I. mentioned that the variation reserves have increased today by approximately EUR1 billion,. so that is really driven by interest rates. If now the credit spreads widen remarkably. further, this might come down a bit.. We will -- we only have -- the turnover, which we have presented at various times at the. Investors Days, and we will have to expect that reinvestment yields, again are going. down. We mentioned that 5 to 10 basis points we might lose. This will increase. What can. we do against it? An immediate reaction, we cannot take. We pursue our programs in real. estate and private equity and others, but other than that, we -- the answer is the same as. always, at least medium-term, we have to reflect that in our reinsurance rates.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. That's great. Thanks Roland.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And Kamran on your second question on Asia, we have started the recruitment plan later. in the last year and are a little bit delayed. Of course the corona crisis has had an impact. on the planning. But for 2019, we didn't have much new recruits based on our plan. The. whole process is starting this year with some delays. So in essence, in terms of footprint,. not a lot of more FTEs, but we have a significant number of FTEs planned for this year and. next year.. The positive part is that the teams in Asia are within the plan or I should say the increased. plan expectations which creates a situation where we need to hire people to manage the. business. But so far, we're on track on the numbers, but are lagging behind a bit on the. resources and are focusing on that, I would say, in the second quarter of this year and. beyond, an increase in recruitment across Asia.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks very much.. Operator. now open, sir. Please go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi. Its Vivek from SocGen. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple from my side. Firstly. in the Group Annual Report, I see the 200-year aggregate annual loss utilization has gone. up by nearly 20% year-on-year, while the 100-year and 250-year PMLs haven't moved up. a lot so is this just a result of increasing exposure at lower written periods, or is there a. completely different explanation to that deviation?. The other question is on the life and health re-EBIT for 2020 and beyond. Is your. expectation still around EUR450 million or perhaps that gets closer to EUR500 million,. given your actions on mortality results and the financial solutions business is doing. extremely well? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Let's start with the second question on the life side. The EUR450 million is probably the. current plan and expectation for 2020. Of course, we work and hope that we can improve. that in the future, but the outlook right now is rather difficult. I don't expect any from the. corona crisis, but it depends on how clients will look for financial solutions in the next. couple of years in the aftermath of the corona crisis.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay.. Michael Pickel. Just -- Michael Pickel, just to your first question and do not have the figures exactly before. me. But in some countries, the regulator ask the clients to buy higher capacities for risk.. And therefore we followed this. And therefore it could give us certain shifts. So for. example, I make the practical example of Canada, where the regulator is very tough on. buying limits. And then we followed up, and this may distort some figures you might find. there. And maybe as well in Germany for example as well Solvency II always drives the. demand for cat business. And having the same line with our clients you follow them as. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So we'll follow up offline on this just to make sure that you have the proper response. We. Vikram Gandhi. Just trying to understand, what is the biggest risk that you see to the growth in financial. Klaus Miller. Do you mean in terms of insurance risk or that we don't get any business in the future?. Vikram Gandhi. Yes. The growth kind of doesn't live up to the trajectory that it has shown overall for. financial solutions.. Klaus Miller. The biggest risk is definitely changes in regulation in the sense that the regulator like we. have seen in the transition from Solvency I to Solvency II, we had an awful lot of Solvency I. business, which was basically not helping the client any longer under Solvency II. And. therefore the client had some extraordinary cancellation rights. The same could happen. to all kinds of regulations around the world in China, in the U.S., in Germany, in Europe,. depending on how regulation is going.. What we're doing on the financial solutions side is basically getting the existing regulation. more in line with economic reality. And if the regulator for whatever reason decides like in. Germany, you need higher reserves to finance your guarantees, you have to build that. ladder. That's fine. We were prepared to do that. And then the regulator came around the. corner with a 16-year transition period. And suddenly all our business we wanted to write. disappeared. Because if the clients get it for free from the regulator, they're not. interested to buy anything from the reinsurer.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.. And the next question we received is from Edward Morris from JPMorgan. Your line is now. open, sir. Please go ahead.. Edward Morris. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just thank you for the update on the. coronavirus. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more around how you see potential. exposures there. So you mentioned a figure of EUR200 million. Is that something that you. see as a sort of upper limit or what are the assumptions that you're including in that? I. believe that's mainly on the P&C business.. I'd also be interested to hear you talk a little bit around life and health. It seems that you. see it as pretty unlikely that there'll be an impact on the life business. But if you could just. talk a little bit more about why that would be the case? And what would have to happen. for you to change your assumptions there?. And then second question just coming back on the reinvestment rate. Can you just clarify. what is the reinvestment rate on the fixed income portfolio now? And yes, thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I think I'll invite Michael to comment on coronavirus and the P&C perspective, and Klaus on. the life and health side first.. Michael Pickel. Yes. I think coronavirus for us and how we brought together the sum was a bit a risk. assessment of our current portfolio. This is not really the worst case, but it's a realistic. case how we address things because for the moment, we do not have any loss advice.. And therefore, I think it's essential just to ring-fence where something could come up.. And there are some closer cases and there are some longer shots.. So for example, property normally business interruption is not granted for corona,. because it's too far away, but it could be an implication on certain sub limits, which may. occur. And so far, we have assessed the number and put a figure for this. The other thing. is contingency. For example as well. For the moment, we are not very strong in this. market. But if you see on the longer horizon, how long corona could be Olympic games. are in danger. So we put there a figure for just addressing the figure.. Two other classes of business we've factored in. One is for example credit business.. There's as well really a question whether credit really and corona fits together, because. when you have a company which has financial problem, corona maybe is the last shot to. bring it in into insolvency, but it's not really the reason why. Therefore, I think we assessed. it. We said some countries are in better shape, in worser shape and then we put up a. number.. And then last but not least, we figured in as well E&O business. I think it's very. questionable whether E&O is really a class of business, where you could address claims,. because then you really are not diligent for your people. And most people know about. health organizations worldwide what they should do and behave accordingly, but we have. assessed this as well in order to have a realistic scenario all over our offices. And this is. the number Jean-Jacques has laid out.. Klaus Miller. Okay. Maybe on the coronavirus impact on the life side. If you just take our standard. business and I have to use very simple numbers now in a telephone call. Let's assume we. have a 10% margin. So if mortality increases by 10%, what does that mean? In the U.S., you. have 350 million people. The average mortality should be about 1%. So that's 3.5 million. who die each and every year in the U.S. That's one of our largest markets.. If this increases by 10%, then you would expect that our profit margin is gone completely.. 10% of 3.5 million means you need 350,000 coronavirus deaths in the U.S. And as long as. you don't see that, I can't see that our bottom line will be impacted. I see much more in. the financial markets, nervousness there. But in terms of really death claims, this is very,. very unlikely, especially because we just talked or I just talked about population mortality,. which is usually much worse than insured population mortality.. And the real high sums insured are usually wealthy people who try to stay away from. infectious areas, have probably good access to the health system. And therefore the. likelihood is even lower than what I just tried to calculate. But this is really a back-of-theenvelope calculation. But I'm absolutely not nervous when it comes to the life and health. result on Hannover Re.. Roland Vogel. Hey. If I then continue with the reinvestment rate. You know the number we usually publish. tomorrow? The number today if I look at my report is 1.2%. For the fixed income portfolio, I. would expect that to increase as I mentioned that we would expect credit spreads to. If the book yield, and that is also a realistic number is around 2.5, to date, we lose 1.2 or. 1.5 with a modified duration of 5. And the very simple again back-of-the-envelope. calculation, which has led us not too badly over the last years would then result in 12, 13. basis points per year. Again, as I mentioned before, we had expected 5 to 10. Now it may. be 10 to 15 but the impact should be limited.. And again I mentioned with the strong unrealized gains, I think if we touch the portfolio,. we will at least in the first years also see realized gains. And in that regard, I do not expect. that our expectation for the year really comes under pressure.. Edward Morris. Perfect. Great to hear answers. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question we received is from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Your line is. now open. Please go ahead.. Sami Taipalus. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the life new business value,. which was very strong this year. Is it possible to just provide a little bit more detail of how. that broke down between the different products? For example, was there a particularly. strong impact of the longevity business this year? That would be very helpful? And is it. also possible to give some form of outlook for 2020, what's the pipeline looking like in. terms of deal or should we really just consider this figure as an exceptional number for. 2019?. Then my second question goes to the U.S. casualty reserve charge. Could you just talk a. little bit more about the extent of the adverse experience that you've observed here?. How big has it been and what does it relate to? And is your decision to reserve more. prudently purely related to what you've seen on your own books or have you used some. external data or external observation to take this decision? Thank you.. Klaus Miller. Yes. Maybe I'll start with the life side. The more than EUR600 million of value of new. business is dominated by longevity on one hand and financial solutions as well as some. new business in China on the other. The reason is value of new business is relatively big if. you have long-term treaties. If you have just a one- or a two-year treaty, value of the. business can't be that high because then it's only one or two years of EBIT margin. So. longevity has certainly an impact here.. And the second one is our financial solutions deals usually 10, 15, up to 20-year deals. The. only area in which we make a lot of a create value a lot of value of new business from. treaties which are already in force is probably in China where the market is growing,. population is large, and an awful lot of business is sold. This is really true new business in. the sense, we had a treaty and then new business was sold and reinsured with us.. Whereas in the other cases, longevity and financial solutions, it's usually block transaction.. And this is the reason why this is a pretty volatile number. It depends on five, six, seven. large deals we write in a year. Does this answer your question?. Sami Taipalus. Yes. That's very helpful. Okay. So I guess your conclusion then is that we should think of. this as normal volatility rather than anything to.... Klaus Miller. We will do our best to stay always above the EUR220 million and do whatever we can get.. Sami Taipalus. Michael Pickel. Yes. Look just from the U.S. side in casualty business, I think it's important for me to say. that we are a bit a strange animal in the U.S. casualty business because we hate larger. limit. So we focus always on limits management when it comes to casualty line of. business. And we are mostly writing regional business, no excess casualty program.. And our idea was really to create a portfolio where we do not underwrite auto business,. commercial auto. We have umbrella private line business. We are a bit on the general. liability, workers' comp. And we ring-fence these segments and saw that the half market. years develop nicely, but we saw that there is some development in the years 2013 and. 2016. And then it was our take to reserve it more prudently and not to factor in that we. have positive development as we have seen that in the past.. So our data is, first of all, client information, paid, and then our own actuarial assumption. on the portfolio. And then finally as well we could not abstain from social inflation. We see. this in hte U.S. and this brought us a bit more to the conservatism that we reserved it. accordingly. Does this answer your question?. Sami Taipalus. Yes. Okay. So you're saying you're basically seeing adverse development on the 2013 and. 2016 years but your response has been across all the prior years and in the current year. as well. Is that correct?. Michael Pickel. As well in the current year, we used a conservative loss fix, but this we did already in the. past. So we always ultimate and then we are reducing them what we have not done, we. have not reduced and for the past years and we had for the years '13 to '16, we brought. precautionary measures.. Sami Taipalus. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question we received is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Your line is. now open, sir. Please go ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi, there. A couple of questions. First of all, a boring technical one. In your annual report on. the balance sheet, there's a very dramatic growth of the unearned premium reserve. And. I appreciate that's because you've grown new business, but it looks very high. Is there. some other accounting change? When I look at the year-on-year movement, there seems. to be some change of consolidation or something, maybe just clarify that.. Secondly, could you remind us about the scope for noise in the life and health results from. ModCo as credit spreads bounce around? This was obviously an issue a few years ago.. Just sort of can you give us any sense of the sensitivity as credit spreads widen and how. that comes through in ModCo?. The other question for Klaus. Why could your mortality risk requirement go up so much,. when you're not really growing some straight mortality business? I mean, you tell us. you're growing mostly in financial solutions and longevity, but the mortality risk. requirement went up nearly 40%. And then linked to that, with the financial solutions. business, in the past you've told us is essentially riskless, but there is tail risk. What is the. tail mortality risk on financial solutions business? Thanks.. Klaus Miller. The last one is the easiest. We have usually mortality rate which can easily deal with a. 200%, 250%, in some cases even 400% of expected mortality. So as long as the. coronavirus does not go up to that level, there is basically no tail risk. And all these. treaties have a clear purpose for the client, which is usually driven by capital solvency in his. own balance sheet. And as soon as he has no problem with that any longer, he wants to. get the business back. Otherwise, he would just pay for something he doesn't need.. Andrew Ritchie. And there's no requirement to mark any of that should any of the clients retention be. consumed? Is there any requirement to reflect any of that in any additional reserve for the. financial solutions business?. Klaus Miller. It's so far out of the money that there is no requirement to do that.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So Andrew maybe I come to your technical question. We have not changed any. accounting practices. We've looked at where it comes from and it comes from all over the. world. So in this regard the assumption should be that really the strong growth maybe. also in some financial or structured reinsurance contracts to a larger extent really have. contributed to the strong contribution to unearned premium reserves nothing. extraordinary.. I see that China has contributed to that as well quite remarkably, but again, it's obviously. driven by the growth. Maybe technically to come back to your question, why has the. capital requirement for the life business increased so much? I did mention and again we. will come with a deeper analysis early April. We have not yet seen each and every detail,. but one main contributor is the low interest rate, which is a little bit difficult to understand,. but you should bear in mind that the risk margin also depends on the interest rate. So that. really goes up because also it's a discounted factor, and the discount factors go down. remarkably. So it's the risk margin plus the growth of the business which bring that up so. remarkably.. Now ModCo, the overall volumes, they have come down. So the volatility should be lower. than what we have seen at around 2009, 2011 and 2012. I cannot really tell you we will. have to look at the portfolio. We will have to look at exactly what is in there because to. now use the spread widening overall of the last week will not lead us there. Of course if. credit spreads widen, the ModCo derivative will be affected. It should be not as. pronounced as we have seen 10 years ago. But I have to admit I don't have final numbers. with me now. We will have to look into those portfolios on an individual basis.. Andrew Ritchie. That's fine. And finally, is that unearned premium reserve more skewed by multi-year. deals? I mean, for example, some of the structure of these, so I shouldn't expect it to. earn through as quickly as normal, I mean just given the size of it or would you expect it to. be earning out over the next 12 months?. Roland Vogel. Well, as I see here from the report in front of me, most of it is P&C. So in this regard, I. would not assume that it is really driven by multi-year contracts. The earnings pattern. should be comparable to the past years.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question we received is from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Your line is now. open, sir. Please go ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one would be for Roland. Maybe Roland,. can you tell us what is your credit exposure to sectors like oil and gas, travel and leisure,. and maybe also the automotive in your corporate bond portfolio?. Second question would be probably for Jean-Jacques. Maybe it could be difficult for you. to say something at this stage but we've seen two days ago big announced merger within. the brokerage industry between Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which is creating really a. giant. It's already a pretty concentrated market. You've got 67% of your P&C business. coming from broker. What's your view? What's your take? And what's your level of. dependency, and how you see things going forward? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Thomas, I start and I give you indications. Of course, it also depends on definitions.. We have a corporate portfolio of around a little bit less than EUR15 billion. The energy, oil. and gas contribution to that would be a little bit above EUR0.5 billion. Hotels and travel. and leisure is less than EUR150 million so that is more or less negligible. The same is true. for airlines.. Automotive is also an area or an industry which comes into question a little bit here. It is. around EUR600 million. So you see, we have always been really focusing on the fact that. we have a highly diversified portfolio. It goes all over the world, all over industries. So in. that regard, we will be affected, but there is no concentration whatsoever in those. industry which you have mentioned.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. So Thomas on the question on the merger, indeed, it's a little bit early to say. Of course,. this is very much in the context of continued consolidation in the brokerage industry, so. not totally astonishing. It'll take a little bit of time until this merger is completed. I think it. might be up to one year. On the negative, clearly for us choice and options are really. important and seeing the consolidation process gives less choices.. On the other hand, we are a great partner to both companies and we continue to grow. with them. And what is clear is that the intent is also to increase the scope of insurability.. So it's not only about only of their respective market shares, but also to create new. concepts, new ideas. It's about innovation. And from that standpoint, having scale and the. wide range of services is important for a brokerage company and gives us access to. more business,. so clearly some negative, some positive. What I should say is that although the. consolidation process continues, this also triggers a lot of different moves from people. who want to establish new brokerage companies. So I don't see this as a unique process.. There will also be new players in the market to make sure there is healthy competition in. the brokerage industry.. Thomas Fossard. Okay. Thanks. Does it change your view regarding the speed at which you would like to. enrich your product offering? I think that initially you thought that you told us that this is. something that you had in mind over the next maybe two to five years. Does this kind of. move, strategic move in the brokerage industry, I mean, potentially accelerating for you. the need to come up with this kind of new services you were talking about?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. No, I don't think this news per se changes our intent I think we always had this. incorporated in our strategy. I think we need to continue to be very relevant to our. customers, but we continue to be very clear broker partner on the P&C side. So we also. wanted to stay relevant to the broker world. So it would not be for me a trigger for. shifting our strategy or starting having a more service focused approach to the business.. We will have selective services and solutions to expand further, but I don't think this really. triggers a change.. Thomas Fossard. Okay. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And the next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. London. Your line is now open, sir. Please go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity. I have one question, please. The. redundant reserves being down by EUR200 million and also accompanying that we have. the statement on the presentation that the conservative reserving on initial years. continues. Could you help me understand what's your kind of outlook, if you like, on how. soon this can be rebuilt?. And I'm also asking because one of the comments made was the casualty losses or. casualty impact on reserving and you mentioned that you're more exposed to SME. regionals. And then as the problem trickles down in that segment from large corporate,. that's always an open-ended question. So I'm just curious to know how you think about. redundant reserves, the rebuild and any risks to that from casualty this year? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Vinit, if I start and I might then ask Michael to step in when it comes to the casualty. details. I think by the end of the third quarter, we were still of the opinion that 2019 might. be a year when we could add. So there would have been a little bit of room to do it, then. the large losses came in remarkably higher. We were well aware of the final impact of this. Ogden rate. But again, it also added a mid-double-digit effect to the reserve. redundancies.. So we went then into the reserving season with well nearly unchanged or some slightly. increased ultimate loss ratios, but the resulting redundancies then came a little bit lower,. because of the increased loss development assumption. So in this regard, we just have to. accept that the reserves have been used for an occasion. We have always told you that. this is why we have them.. Also when the Ogden rate event happened for the first time also there, we have been. using them. Now we had experienced a slightly less than expected performance, we have. increased here the reserves. And this is again why we have used them. We always. mentioned that we will use them in case we need it. And if there is an opportunity to add. to them next year, we will do that again. And the most important thing is that we are very. transparent about it and that we have not changed our overall reserving policy as such.. Michael Pickel. Yes. I think only just to add. In the Brazilian market, it's a developing situation. We are not a. big reinsure in the Brazilian market. Our sweet spot mostly fits in the agro and property. business. And so far we are sitting a bit on the side steps with a very limited exposure on. casualty and specialty lines. That's my take for the moment.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. The next question we received is from Paris Hadjiantonis from Exane BNP Paribas. Your. line is now open, sir. Please go ahead.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes. Hi, and good afternoon from my side as well. The first question is on your runoff. result. Basically, when I look at your triangles in your annual report, there is a large. negative effect coming from the 2018 underwriting year. I know it can be a bit technical,. but the absolute number looks quite large. So I don't think it's only explained by Jebi. So if. you could give us some details on that that would be helpful.. The second question is on financial solutions and the contribution to the other income. For. 2019, I think it was EUR287 million. And you are saying that you plan to increase volumes or. your value of new business is showing that you have already increased volumes. So should. we be thinking that this EUR287 million is going to be growing quite a lot for 2020. onwards?. Lastly, and I know you don't really give a lot of details on Solvency II, but if I could just. check maybe qualitative your operating capital generation for 2019. I assume that it was. more or less in line with expectations given that the difference from the 237% that you've. shown in your last disclosure is more or less explained by the model changes from the. dynamic volatility adjuster. Thank you.. Roland Vogel. So if come back to the runoff result, you mentioned, I think it's a little bit we've seen that. or it's a pattern. We've seen that before that the most recent years where we usually then. add reserves is negative. That had been the case before. It's a little bit increased this time. by Jebi. There is one other impact from a large advanced solutions contract which is. nearly risk free,. but this is more a technical change between a profit commission and losses. So this is. more technical. There is nothing unusual in that respect. Overall as mentioned, the runoff. result has been positive within the expected range and a little bit impacted by Jebi and. some other really overall developments going down, but nothing extraordinary.. Klaus Miller. On the financial solutions side, yes, we expect to develop this business. But as I. mentioned in one of my earlier answers, this will be very lumpy. We have a changing. regulatory environment for our cedent. And therefore it's very difficult to have a steady. growth expectation here. But in general, yes, we would like and we expect this line to. grow.. So anything else we have forgotten?. Roland Vogel. Capital generation.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. The capital generation question. Paris, could you rephrase your third question, please?. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes, yes, sure. So basically I was just wondering whether or not your operating capital. generation for 2019 on a Solvency II basis was more or less in line with your expectations. at the Investor Day.. Roland Vogel. Yes. As mentioned, I think we gave you the forecast at the Investors Day. At the occasion. of the Investors Day, we only referred to the potential additional hybrid. So the difference. between the EUR750 million issue and the potential call in 2020. So we added EUR250. million, and we disregarded the dynamic volatility adjuster because BaFin approval was. not certainly enough to already consider that at that point in time. If you really add the two",20200311_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2020-3-11_RT000000002807304668.pdf,2020-03-11
23,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Interim Results Third Quarter 2016. For your information, this. conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like the hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining. the Hannover Re conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, Roland Vogel and we. are pleased to present to you the figure for the first nine months of 2016.. We are very pleased that our net income for the first nine months saw an increase. compared to last year and now stands at €790 million. We feel that this increase is. remarkable for three reasons. Firstly, last (0:58) result was aided by a positive one-off. effect to the tune of €39 million which, of course, was not repeated this year.. Secondly, business environment for reinsurance remained difficult due to the continued. soft market in the P&C reinsurance business and due to the continued low interest rate. environment. Thirdly, the absolute level of profitability displayed in the first nine months is. fully in line with our profitability target. At least from the favorable results for the nine. months, we are increasingly confident that we will reach our full year net income guidance,. provided that the large losses as well as the capital markets develop, in line with the. expectations.. Adjusted for foreign exchange rate movement, the growth premium income is slightly. down by 1.7% whilst the net premiums earned, at the same time, are slightly up again by. 1.7%.. The reason for this is mainly the result of some discontinued large transactions in. particular on the Life & Health side, which however had significant amounts of (2:33) on. them so that the effects are more pronounced regarding the gross premiums and less on. the net premium side.. On the P&C side, whilst the volume is a little bit down after nine months, our fee income. increased premium on the third quarter on a stand-alone basis. This is due to new. business being written in the third quarter, and thus, we can expect that this development. will continue into the fourth quarter.. Shareholder's equity increased by 8.8% and the book value per share stands at €72.81.. The reason for this will be explained by Roland. Nevertheless, due to the favorable. earnings, the ROE continues to remain at attractive levels, well above our minimum target. with an ROE for the first nine months of 12.5%.. The combined ratio, as well as the resultant increased underwriting result, is very much in. line with expectation and the third quarter did not benefit from any reserve releases over. and above the usual positive runoff result. Following the benign third quarter of large. losses, we are well below our large loss target after nine months. However, in line with our. usual practice, we largely kept the unused part of the large loss budget for the remainder. of the year.. Our Life & Health business developed somewhat above our expectation even though last. year's result was benefiting from the already mentioned positive one-off effect. The EBIT. increased by 17.9% compared to last year and this increase in profitability in particular. stems from our Paris branch that last year we had experienced some problems. This, of. course, will not repeat it this year, and our Paris branch is back to the normal level of. profitability.. Despite the fact that we saw some adverse claims experience on our U.S. Mortality. business, overall, the profitability of our U.S. business on the Life & Health side is up. The. net income or the income from our investments under management is fully in line with our. full-year target. So, return on investment from assets under management reached 3.0%. which is even slightly more than our full year target of 2.9%.. With this rather positive note, I would like to hand over to Roland who will explain to you. these figures in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Good morning and thank you, Uli. As usual, I will focus on the nine months figures and. try to keep my comments as brief as possible, not the least because the quarter is fairly. straightforward, and does not include too many extraordinary effects.. The slight decrease in the top-line is in line with our expectation for the full year, especially. in light of the strong growth we recorded in the previous year. Net premium income. increased by 1.7%. This is driven by the change in unearned premium in our P&C segment. on the one hand and by the slight increase in retention on our Life & Health segment on. the other.. Investment income is in line with our expectation excluding the €39 million positive one-off. effect in Life & Health in Q1 2015. Investment income from assets under own management. is on the level of the previous year, which I feel can be seen as a success in the current. yield environment.. Other income expenses decreased mainly to less positive currency effects. We are still in. positive range, but not to the extent we had experienced last year. Last year, the. depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar had that significant positive effect, which. again didn't repeat itself. At 27%, the tax ratio was only slightly higher than in the previous. year.. On the next page, you see that shareholders' equity increased by 8.8%. On the right hand. side of this slide, you can see that in addition to our very positive result, most notably the. capital contribution from valuation reserves in our investments increased by nearly €700. million as a result of low interest rates, thereby more than compensating the dividend. payment.. On one the hand, it is good to see our capital strengths improving even further, while on. the other hand, the increased valuation reserves loan are diluting our return on equity by. more than 50 basis points. Without that additional increase in reserves, the ROE would. have been over 13%.. At €1.7 billion, cash flow continue to be very positive in the first nine months of 2016, again. demonstrating the strong cash flow production of our business model. Supported by this,. assets under own management increased by 3.4% to more than €40 billion, increasing. valuation reserve had a positive effect of around €1 billion while the negative impact from. foreign exchange rates on the other hand was around €700 million, to especially the. weakening of the British pound after the Brexit decision has materialized.. As a result of our strict margin oriented underwriting approach, P&C gross premium. decreased by the mentioned 1.5% on an FX adjusted basis. This decrease is less. pronounced and reported at the time of the half year results, driven by a favorable. premium development in the third quarter, which showed an increase of 6% on a standalone basis.. Please bear in mind that we had a non-recurring effect associated with the accounting of. our facultative business in the previous year, where we booked almost €100 million in. additional premium. Moreover, we scaled back our involvement in Chinese motor. business as well as in our specialty lines particularly in aviation where rates did not justify a. continued participation. This was partly offset by business opportunities especially in the. U.S. and additional contributions from our structured reinsurance team.. Net premium earned increased by 0.9% on an FX-adjusted basis. This is as already. mentioned, not the result of a higher retention which actually decreased slightly, but. rather it is due to the change in unearned premium driven by the strong growth in 2015.. Following a very benign first and a very active second quarter, loss activity was clearly. below the expected level in the third quarter with net large losses amounting to only 41%. versus the quarterly budget allocation of €265 million. As a result, the overall large losses. were 6.6% of net premium income for the first nine months and, therefore, significantly. below expectations.. However, in line with our usual practice, we have capped the yearly large loss. expectations in our reserving assumptions which provides us with a comfortable buffer for. the rest of the year. On that basis, the pleasing underwriting results leads to a combined. ratio of 95%, clearly beating our maximum target of 96%.. In the third quarter, the run-off of reserves was positive within the expected range and we. did not benefit from any extraordinary developments here.. You will remember that we did mention an extraordinary positive run-off of around €150. million at the end of the second quarter, which largely is still included in the year-to-date. number. At that point in time, the confidence level of reserves were slightly down when. compared to the end of the 2015. I here do refer to the number we have published. during our Investors Day of nearly €1.9 billion. With the positive result in Q3 stand-alone,. the confidence level of our loss reserves should have at least remained stable or even. slightly improved when compared to the end of June.. On the reinvestment income here was in line with expectations, the total investment. income decreased slightly. I will explain the details later. The tax rate increased slightly. compared to last year mainly as a result of a less positive result from our Bermudian. subsidiary. Altogether, with an EBIT margin of more than 15%, the P&C segment again. delivered a very pleasing performance in the light of a challenging market environment.. As already mentioned, the overall large loss situation was below budget for the first nine. months. As a result, the unused part of our large loss budget was boosted or has. boosted the remaining large loss budget for the rest of the year to €432 million at the. end of the third quarter. Based on a recent conservative, but of course still uncertain first. calculation, Hurricane Matthew led to a loss of slightly below €100 million and with some. smaller losses from Italy and the larger fire loss in Germany. Today we should have. approximately €300 million left for the remainder of the year when it comes to large. losses.. After nine months, 14 losses are showing up on our large loss list. The overall benign large. loss experience can be attributed mainly to the very moderate situation in the third. quarter, which was one of the least affected quarters if I look at that recent past. The. absence of a major Atlantic hurricane, as mentioned Matthew was a fourth quarter event,. is not the only factor here because other losses were also below the expected level.. Looking at the technical profitability of our P&C book by line of business, but first to. confirm the favorable development in the business line as explained in connection with. the half year results. The combined ratio in Marine includes a positive run-off of reserves. of roughly €40 million in total in the second quarter. As expected, the combined ratio for. the first nine months here is trending higher again, but it is still below the normal level.. On a nine months basis, various lines made good contributions to the very positive results. and in particular, the target markets driven in part by the volume of the segment. Our. NatCat segment is also back below the MtCR, thanks to the absence of Cat losses in Q3.. The earthquake loss in Ecuador explains the high combined ratio in the worldwide treaty. business, and credit and surety was mainly affected by one large claim. As mentioned, our. P&C portfolio, as a whole, continues to perform well below the maximum tolerable. combined ratio.. As we explained in our Q2 call, premium growth in our life and health segment was. particularly strong in the third and the fourth quarters of the previous year, and, hence, our. premium decreased by 2% adjusted for currency effects here. This is mainly driven by the. discontinuation of individual large treaties in China and Australia, marking the continued. demand in Longevity especially from the UK.. Net premium earned increased by almost 2.8%, adjusted for currency effects, and the. increase in net retention reflects, first and foremost, the reduced need for repossession. premium Ulrich has already mentioned.. Even without adjusting for the €39 million positive one-off effect in the previous year, the. EBIT for the first nine months of 2016 has increased significantly as compared to 2015.. Our financial solutions business continues to show excellent profitability with an EBIT. margin of more than 19%, Longevity also favorable with an EBIT margin above the 2%. target.. The unfavorable development of the US mortality experienced in the second quarter is. the main reason for the missing mortality and morbidity. Here, the third quarter, US. mortality came in with the results slightly above expectation. Overall, the 4.3% trigger is. definitely an improvement as compared to 2015.. On the investment side, ordinary investment income here was similarly in line with our. expectation, realized gains a little bit higher than normal, and I will come to this on the. next slide. The effect from our ModCo derivatives was close to zero for the first nine. months. And again, all together, net income increased strongly by nearly 18%.. Looking at the investment, the development is very satisfactory with investment income. slightly above our expectations. The decrease in ordinary investment income mainly due. to the last year's one-off effects from the termination fee in Life & Health. Additionally, the. decreased reinvestment yields have the expected effect on our fixed income portfolio. although this was, at least, partially compensated for by higher returns from real estate. and private equity.. Realization; slightly above last year's level with the majority driven by structural changes in. our private equity portfolio but also some turnover in our L&H portfolios, partially driven by. the restructuring of our US collateralization requirements to decrease the respective. costs. Other than that, we did not harvest the sharply increased unrealized gains on our. fixed income portfolio. Overall, realization of this asset class have actually decreased. compared to the previous year.. As you know, the volatile equity markets following the Brexit referendum resulted in some. impairments on individual stocks within our equity portfolio in the second quarter. Overall,. the equity portfolio even including such write-downs is well in the positive range. Apart. from that, impairments mainly consisted of regular depreciation on our real estate. portfolio. The return on investment was 3.0%, slightly ahead of the 2.9% we are targeting. for the full year.. And the next slide shows an overview of how the different asset classes contributed to. the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand. side, you can see what we have – that we have kept the asset allocation rather stable. As I. also explained in our Investors Day in October, we are still following a strategy of investing. in – of more investing in the highly liquid government bonds in combination with some. higher-yielding asset classes when it comes to the investment of new cash.. Altogether, this may lead to a slightly higher utilization within the existing risk appetite on. the capital market risk side and is increasing the liquidity of the overall portfolio. At 38%,. corporate bonds have, by the far, the highest share, and our investment income, real. estate and private equity are contributing significantly more than their respective share in. the asset allocation.. Finally, the modified duration of our asset portfolio has slightly increased to 4.8. But I think. I should now conclude.. And as usual, I leave the target matrix to Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Yes, on the target matrix, you can see that despite all the challenges. we would like to comment on continuously we see ticks on almost all our profitability. target. Keeping in mind the strong growth that we saw in 2015, it does not concern us that. the premium income has fallen short of our growth targets for the first nine months. I. already explained and Roland as well the development that is the result of that.. Our guidance for 2016 remains unchanged, purely based on the results after nine months. and disregarding the possibility of major losses exceeding the expectations or a distortion. of the capital markets. The net premium income target of €950 million at least appears to. be well within reach. Based on such a result like in previous years, we would, again. consider to pay a special dividend over and above our usual payout ratio of 35% to 40%.. Looking at the individual segments of our well diversified P&C business. You can see that. the premium income looks rather flattish for the entire year. North America, we already. mentioned we have written some new treaties in the third quarter, so we will see an. increase there, maybe a little bit more pronounced even than we have seen after nine. months.. Also, this is aided by the Canadian business because following the large wild claims, we. saw opportunities to grow our business in Canada at a very acceptable and increased. rate.. Continental Europe, it's very competitive at this point in time, particularly if you go outside. Germany. Therefore, in order to safeguard profitability, we expect that the premium. income will be slightly down, but (24:08) only slightly down.. On the Marine side, we feel that we have quality book. However, we try to keep the book. as pure as possible and therefore under current market conditions, we see premium. reducing but the profitability will continue to be favorable.. Aviation, as mentioned, very soft market. We have changed our portfolio back to a soft. market portfolio which we have in the late 1990s and before. There of course, reduced. the premium volume, very significantly, but we feel that the business on that basis can be. profitable and we are pretty confident that it will be profitable this year, largely also. because of the very conservative loss reserve position we are seeing there.. Credit and surety and political risk, volume quite stable. Results, we had one large claim. Roland mentioned, but also we saw increasing frequency of claims in the developing. world and the developing markets due to the turmoil that you have seen in some of the. economies there.. UK, Ireland, London market and direct, going fine. Profitability should be above the cost of. capital, and we would also expect more or less a flat volume. Facultative, due to the oneoff effect already mentioned, premium volume is down, but profitability should continue. to be above the cost of capital.. On worldwide treaty, we have continued to see growth in Asia, and therefore premiums,. despite the soft market, should be flat. And for the full year, we expect the results to. return to be within the maximum tolerable combined ratio.. On the cat side, there's some business that we write in Bermuda, and again, flat. premiums. Well, I mean, if we have significant losses in the last weeks of this year to bring. up the overall loss levels to the expected losses, then we will not earn the cost of capital.. However, for the remainder of the year, that would, of course, be a very, very negative. result.. And we are very happy with the development of our structured reinsurance. We see. increased demand here that we were able to fully compensate the discontinuation of. some rather large Chinese motor quota share new business and also, I mean, going. forward, we can expect growth from this segment.. Coming to the Life & Health business, we can see that our volume should remain largely. stable. This growth on Longevity and some reduction of premium income. On the. mortality side, again, as this is due to the treaty set that are discontinued that have. already been mentioned.. Profitability, overall, pretty good. Particularly exciting on the financial solutions side. The. business is actually developing very well. And particular in the US, we have very good. pipeline of new opportunities as well. As I've said, Longevity business continued demand. from the UK, but also continued competition. So, we see some growth opportunities. there.. Coming then to the guidance for 2017. As we have done in previous years, we would like. to give you a guidance for next year. This is a report of the nine months of the current. year. In general, we feel that for next year, we should largely be able to maintain our gross. written premium at the levels of the current year. And this is both true for the gross and. the net premiums. And also, pretty much stemming from both of our business group.. On the P&C side, we expect soft market conditions to continue. But at the same time, we. feel that we have very good quality book and we've also seen some slowdown in the rate. reductions. And on the Life & Health side, we expect continued underlying growth of the. profitability of our business. Therefore, we feel that the group net income should again. be more than €950 million for next year. I mean, all pretty much in line with what we have. seen for the current year.. The return on investment. Of course, as Roland explained for many years, continues to go. down in relative to – by 20 basis points to 2.7%. However, this downward trend will be. mitigated by expected increased assets under management because we continue to. expect a positive cash flow from our business.. This basically shows, I mean, (30:46) development of the results, we will again consider. paying special dividend also for 2017. Of course, considering that all things being equal,. capital level remains comfortable. And, of course, the large losses and the capital markets. develop in line with expectation. This, of course, is also the provider (31:14) for our net. income guidance.. This slide may be familiar to you, if you watched and listened to our Investor Day in. October. As you can see, we believe that our business model would allow us to grow the. bottom end of the top line in the medium term, fueled by improved profits on the P&C. side with an improving market and increased profits on our Life & Health side once the. legacy problems of some of our US mortality business are solved.. For investment returns, we assume that they should be largely stable in absolute terms. due to the continued low-interest rate environment. In the short term, however, we. expect profits to remain stable so that we will continue our policy to pay extra dividends. to manage the growth of the capital.. With that, this concludes our presentation. And we look forward to your questions. Thank. you very much.. Q&A. Operator. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. One moment please for the first. question. The first question is from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first one is just on – so you were seeing. a bit of a shift in yields in the last day or so and kind of a little bit before that as well. If. yields continue to go up, how will that change your investment strategy going forward?. That's the first question.. And the second question, I guess again, related to the impacts of what's going on in the. US, we heard, yesterday, there might be some more spending on infrastructure. There. might be some new opportunities coming out in the US. Can you just, maybe, give a few. comments on what you think, I guess, the business potential is in the US in the, I guess, in. this new world? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean, for the second question, I will hand the first one to Roland in a second. Of. course, I mean, you say it's a new world, but it's a very new world, and I would say what. actually will develop in the US from recent events is difficult to predict, I would say. I mean,. for the time being, we assume that we will continue to do business as usual in the US and. – I mean, outside from any political events, we see further good prospects to grow our. business there.. Kamran Hossain. Okay.. Roland Vogel. And with regards to the investment strategy, although this might not really increase. fantasy, I don't see us changing the strategy a lot because if you go back two or three. years, and you had looked at our composition of the overall portfolio, and that was at. times when interest rates were low, but still remarkably higher than they are today. So, if. Of course, if you see some volatility, it may make sense to follow a strategy a little bit in. accelerated terms, and – but also here (35:25) yesterday, didn't give us a lot of. opportunities. I'm sure some – we're waiting for that, but it didn't materialize. So, overall,. the composition shouldn't change much even if it goes up. I did mention the impact that. the additional valuation reserve after Brexit had on the ROE. But when it comes to the. overall portfolio composition, nothing would change that much. Yes, of course, if there is. volatility, one would try to take benefit out of that, but only to a small extent.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from Edward Morris of JPMorgan.. Edward Morris. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First is on the net income. guidance for the current year. Obviously, given what you've done over nine months and. the unused budget that you're carrying into Q4, it looks very conservative, I would say. I. think I remember asking the same question last year. If you could just talk a little bit how. we should think about that for Q4, particularly given that you released the extra €150. million in Q2. Is there any temptation to kind of top that up again if you're doing much. better than expected by the end of the year?. And then, the second question is on capital and potential special dividends. Given that you. are guiding again to stable to slightly down on premium, is there any particular reason not. to return all of the capital that you've generated this year or how do we balance the year –. the choice between operating at the most efficient point and sort of steady progression. on a year-on-year basis? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Yeah. I mean, on the net income guidance, I already said that of course this – the results. that we have achieved after nine months and with still quite comfortable level of unused. large loss budget, at least €950 million would now probably put a higher emphasis on the. – at least, rather than the €950 million. But nonetheless, we said we keep the guidance. stable also in order to – or readily display that we see for 2017 a similar situation from the. outset than we had for 2016.. The guidance, of course, always assumes that the large loss budget will be used. completely. Regarding the special dividend, yeah, I mean, we will, of course, again after. the fourth quarter look at the capital ratios. I mean, your colleague has just mentioned. some possibility of interest rate increases which might already take out some of the. growth of the capital. But, once we have done that, we will then consider how much we. pay out. I would say that, at this point in time, I not see us going below the €4.75 that we. paid out for 2015.. Edward Morris. Okay. Thank you.. Roland Vogel. It's sufficiently vague (39:03) to answer your question.. Edward Morris. Yeah. Thanks. And just on the first point about the reserves, the additional reserve release. year?. Ulrich Wallin. No. I think we will probably keep – not put that back into the buffer because – I mean, at. the end of 2015, the buffer has gone quite high also in the eyes of our auditors. So, I don't. think we will have, really the room to put that back.. Edward Morris. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Jonny Urwin of UBS Limited. Please go ahead.. Jonny Urwin. Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. Thinking a bit. about growth firstly. So, I remember at the Investor Day, you guys were talking about. growing in credit, surety, political risk in the US. I can see on the profitability matrix today. that that's got a bit less profitable and that you're guiding to stable volumes overall. I. mean, is it still the case that you'd like to grow in the US and you're shrinking elsewhere?. Just a bit of color there would be great.. Also, on the Life division US mortality. So, I mean I remember you being quite cautious at. the Investor Day. But obviously, today's results are pretty good. And there's a comment in. the release that the restructuring is starting to bear fruit. So, I mean, are you still quite. cautious there? Is this just a bit of a lumpy quarter where you've had no – large one-offs. and we should think that the outlook is still relatively subdued? Thanks very much.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean, on the credit and surety, I mean, what we write in the US is largely excess of. loss business which has been extremely profitable overall those years. And as a result, of. course, the credit balances – the credit balance on that business is, I mean, very, very. favorable for reinsurers and that of course puts pressure on pricing.. So, I don't think that our growth on credit and surety will particularly come from US but to a. compared to, say, 2009, 2010 and 2011, as I said, one of the reasons is, of course, that we. saw increased claims activity particular in the emerging market, but that is, of course,. hence, a positive outlook there.. the reinsurance treaties and particularly on the credit business, of course, I mean, they. results that we have seen in those years, I mean, commission terms are pretty close to. where we were as I said with our pre-cycle.. So, all in all, I mean, where we grow on that business is largely due to our position that we. have reached being the second largest credit and surety reinsurer, and therefore, if there. are opportunities, we normally go to see them, and that could actually result in some. growth even in the fourth quarter.. On the life side, yeah, I mean, I think I'll probably remain relatively cautious when you look. at the big block that we purchased in 2008 because it has continued to surprise us. negatively. I mean, yes, the restructuring beared some fruit. I mean, for example, if you. look at the other income line on the Life & Health business for this year, we saved, in the. first nine months, €24 million in LC costs and that is, of course, directly associated with the. restructuring there.. And also, our new business that we write in the US, I mean, we have been quite. successful in growing that business and it is actually quite profitable. I mean, there, we. actually see, for the most part, positive deviation from the expectation. So, I mean,. eventually that business will get more profitable because – I mean, the new business is. becoming more prevalent in the overall result and see the big blocks that we purchase. becomes – I mean, loses somewhat in weight of the overall result.. Therefore – I mean, actually, I expect an improvement in our US mortality business. I mean,. the remainder of our US business, particular financial solutions is performing excellent.. And also what we call health and special risk is another area that we write in the US and. looking all that as well, our US business, nonetheless, shows increasing profitability, if you. take the entire piece.. Jonny Urwin. That's great. Thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from In-Yong Hwang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.. In-Yong Hwang. Hello. Thank you very much for taking my question. I've got two. Firstly, on the Life Re top. line, third quarter saw quite a sharp decline. You pointed to some large transactions in. Australia and China that were discontinued. But looking forward, do you kind of see. potentially more of these discontinuations of large transactions, and is there any pattern. that you see here?. And I guess, just linked to some of the largest deals you're doing based in Life and P&C,. how much of the pipeline do you factor into your premium guidance for 2017? I guess they. can be quite lumpy, but it'd be interesting to see whether you see the risk more to the. upside or the downside regarding that side of things?. And my second question is on the Cat XL combined ratio that you've shown on slide 8. I. think there's quite a big variation from quarter-to-quarter, which I guess I find slightly. difficult to understand given that you booked the large loss but in full before tuning up in. fourth quarter. So, if you just help us explain where the variation comes from quarter-toquarter, please. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you for the question. I mean, on the Life Re top line, I think we are through, in. 2016, with the effect from the discontinuation of large treaties. Because, I mean, the. largest part of this has actually been single premium transactions from China where we. just reached our maximum risk that we are prepared to take on these. And as a single. premium, I mean, there is no further premium to be accounted on those. Of course, the. margin is gradually coming out of those treaties.. And the other just was a large Australian group business, which unfortunately we lost, but. there is – I mean, in Australian business, we are back to underlying growth there. So, I. mean, we will have to make up for this lost transaction, I think, in the next two years,. because as the rest of our Australian business is growing actually quite favorable.. But we take into account in the premium guidance for next year, both for P&C and Life &. Health, are not the assumptions that we should be able to write any loss transactions. But. if we do, they would come on top. What we take into account is the usual developments. that we expect. For example, on the Life & Health side, on our U.S. mortality business, the. new business, I mean, that will grow because we have certain assumption on new. business that we write. And, also, on the existing business, yes, it's YRT due to the. premium increases year-on-year as that automatically would create some growth and. then as if that is included. And the same as the growth we are seeing, for example, on our. Australian retail business. In the normal course of business, that's included. But any. extraordinary large transaction that may or not come about, we not include that in our. guidance as we also don't include it in our planning.. On the development of the combined ratio on the Cat side, I mean, on the Cat business. in the second quarter, we just went above the large loss budget.. And whilst during the year when we don't reach the budget, we are not released that.. However, then in a quarter, we have losses that are above the budget, we were booked. for those rather than using the budget of the next quarter, and that explained why the. combined ratio on Cat segment, jumped up in the second quarter and a step down in the. third quarter.. Roland Vogel. If I may add, you should also bear in mind that it's not always a direct correlation between. something happening and the business line as we present it here. So, for instance, I did. mention, I think the earthquake in Ecuador made itself felt mostly in the worldwide. business because it was more per risk book rather than a Cat XL book. If you go back to,. for instance, to Sandy that was more a marine loss event than anything else, so you. should bear in mind that also the losses, even if we see them as Cats, do not only show. up in that business line. There can be a different composition as well.. In-Yong Hwang. All right. Thank you very much.. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca Securities. Please go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Life margins, from speaking with IR team today, it appeared there are some realized. gains as well as part of this restructuring of the collateral business. Could you quantify that. please, so we can get some idea of what is the underlying sort of EBIT margin in Life, if. you don't mind?. And second question is just to clarify, this merely 7% growth in premiums in CapEx. adjusted in P&C in 3Q stand-alone. Just to clarify, is it coming from U.S. or is it coming. from some structured facultative, those kind of lines? Just want to clarify that please.. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if I may take the second and leave Roland the first one. Yes, I mean, this stand-alone. third quarter growth for the most part is actually U.S. business. And partly that U.S.. business on advanced solutions and partly its traditional U.S. business, largely property. rather than casualty. That is the reason there.. And in Asia, of course, the facts of the discontinued motor quota share are no longer. prevalent if you could compare third quarter to third quarter. And the compensating. business that we wrote in particular in Eastern Europe, of course, is making itself felt in the. third quarter numbers. That actually as I've said will continue into the fourth quarter.. And with the Life question, Roland is working at it and he will answer that now.. Vinit Malhotra. Thanks.. Roland Vogel. Vinit, of course, we do not exactly track each and every security which is sold, as to why it. was sold. But if I – and this is a little bit of gut feeling and a rough number, I would say, at. approximately or around €20 million was the extraordinary number. We may come back to. that but that would be my first gut feeling that this has increased from quarter-to-quarter.. It may even be a little bit less than that if you make it €15 or so. That would be the number. which just came through by touching some of the portfolios where we had changes from. deposits and collateral provisions here.. Vinit Malhotra. Yeah. Thanks, I appreciate your color here. Thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hello, hi there. I just wanted a quick update on Australia from a Life claims perspective.. You start to see primary insurers taking into account the new mortality tables and talk. about still elevated claims levels and disability and individual income per section. How are. claims running for you relative to the adjustments you've made a couple of years ago?. And what's your general view on new business opportunities in the Australian Life market?. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if you look at the new mortality business in Australia, I mean, we have taken into. account, of course, the new tables but it hasn't affected our business negatively. I mean,. particularly on our retail business, results are actually above expectation. Therefore, our. Australian result is in line with expectation and a little bit up compared to last year. Where. we see further growth is largely in the retail business, and to some extent, also, again, in. the group business, where we have improved our service levels and that is fueling some. additional business.. with our reserve that we increased quite a lot two years ago. However, what we see is. due to the reduced interest rate fee, sufficiency of the future premiums – I'm sorry,. deficiency reserve for that has actually increased due to the drop in interest rates. But. this, I mean, detrimental effect as a result was more than offset by better performance of. the rest of the business.. Andrew J. Ritchie. And is the individual morbidity business also running in line?. Ulrich Wallin. No. That's what I mentioned. I mean, what we call the legacy DII business.... Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. Individual disability income as I said, claim frequency and severity is in line with. expectation. However, the discounting of the future expected the claims and that is. actually suffering from the reduced interest rates.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. So it's fair to say the prime rate to some degree may be catching up with whether. reinsurers adjusted things already.. Ulrich Wallin. That's right. Yes.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.. Frank Kopfinger. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on, again, on your. unused large or major loss budget. You mentioned the €300 million that are still available. as of today. How should we think about that if we assume that there are no major losses. going for the remainder of this year? Would you put it again into the reserves or are you. willing to put it into the P&L, so to say?. And my second question is on your credit spread sensitivity. Within your appendix, you. show a sensitivity which is based on a relative term. So, increasing it by 50%, could you. translate the sensitivity into basis points development?. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Let me take the first one, and then Roland the second one of your question. I mean,. if there are no large loss from now to year-end, definitely, our result will be well above. €950 million. Because then, not all the unused budget will then remain in reserves. I mean,. a fair amount of that will be released. And the reason for that is that, as we have shown. you on the Investor Day, that level of the redundancies has increased quite significantly in. 2015, pretty much above expectation and we have to take that into account. And we look. at things like keeping additional redundant loss reserves somewhere on the balance. sheet.. Roland Vogel. Yeah, Kopfinger, let's come back for your sensitivity question. If you go back a few years in. our presentations and you look at that sensitivity which we provide, I think we had a shift in. 50 basis points or 100 basis points in absolute terms. We then had a similar discussion as. we now have today that this from the addressee's point of view it really doesn't make. sense. If you increase in a stressed scenario AA rated bond by 50% and a BB investment. also by 50%, this is not the same scenario.. As from then onwards, we changed that to percentage points. So I cannot translate that in. absolute basis points of course, because if we have a corporate bond with the credit. spread of, let's assume, 50 basis points then the 50% stress of course then would. increase that to 75%. If we have a high yield bond with 300 basis points, that would. increase the stress to 150%. We felt that this, of course, rather standardized approach. provides more meaningful information.. Internally, of course, we use other stresses. You should bear in mind if something really. dramatic happens, one would assume that corporate or government bonds or very high. rated bonds would be a safe harbor and even potentially decrease credit spread. So. there are far more complicated things available, but we felt that the percentage stress. provides more meaningful information, this is why we have included it here.. Frank Kopfinger. The issue is obviously always the starting point. And maybe it might make sense to break. it down into government spreads and corporate spreads?. Roland Vogel. (1:00:35) If I can take that up, potentially, this is a good topic for the next Investors Day or. something like this. And you have a special demand, again, we can cater for them, but this. is what we usually we provided. And again, we changed it to make it more meaningful.. Frank Kopfinger. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. There are no further questions. I hand back to the speakers.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you very much again for joining our conference call. Thank you for your. questions, and I wish you all a very nice day. And yes, thank you. Good-bye.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect now.",20161110_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2016-11-10_FS000000002314193714.pdf,2016-11-10
24,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re. International Analysts Conference Call on the 2020 Annual Results. For your information,. this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your. host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to this conference call,. which is aimed at presenting our results for the full year 2020. As usual, I'll start with an. overview before our group CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel goes over the financials in more. detail. I will then comment on the outlook for 2021. And for the QandA, I'm additionally. joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.. 2020 was definitely an extraordinary year, and the world still finds itself facing an. exceptional situation. We've had all to deal with ongoing difficult circumstances and the. COVID-19 pandemic has dominated development in society and economies around the. world. It remains as well a challenge for the whole industry, insurance and reinsurance. In. this volatile environment, the Hannover Re Group has again proven its resilience and. demonstrated its support for its clients. Bearing in mind that we have absorbed a total net. pre-tax impact of around EUR1.2 billion from COVID-19 in our PandC and Life and Health. businesses. The group net income of EUR883 million and the return on equity of 8.2% can. be considered quite satisfactory.. Additionally, the Solvency II ratio stayed above our minimum threshold of 200%. throughout the year and stood at a strong 235% at the end of 2020. Not only that, we. recorded double-digit premium growth, particularly driven by the improving market. environment in PandC, reinsurance and overall. While there are still uncertainties. surrounding the course of the pandemic, it is our expectation that COVID-19 will have. significantly less influence on the development of Hannover Re's business going forward.. Furthermore, we anticipate sustained improvement in prices and conditions in both the. insurance and reinsurance markets, and Hannover Re is very well positioned to benefit. from these market dynamics. For this reason, we have decided to omit payment of a. special dividend for 2020, and to make maximum use of the opportunities opening up in. the market. For the ordinary dividend, we will propose to pay EUR4.5 per share.. Going into the details of the results for our PandC Reinsurance business. The additional. EUR250 million reserving related to COVID-19 claims in the fourth quarter brings the total. net loss estimate to EUR950 million. Here we have taken a more conservative and also a. more long-term view of the loss expectation with further reserves added for event. cancellation, credit and surety and also long tail lines like casualty. Additionally, it was. important for us to keep the IBNR at a high level to reflect the uncertain environment and. large loss expenditures, excluding the COVID-19 losses were bit below average overall.. However, including the COVID-19 losses, our budget for 2020 was exceeded by EUR620. million, bringing the full year combined ratio to 101.6%.. In Life and Health Reinsurance, the COVID-19 impact on the result was EUR261 million.. Here the main driver continues to be our U.S. business. Against this backdrop, the EBIT of. EUR385 million is strong, also stripping out some extraordinary effects from an equity. participation. Financial Solutions continues to perform superbly, and the U.S. mortality. experience excluding the COVID-19 effect was in line with our expectations. Finally, at 3%,. the return on investment was quite favorable and ahead of the 2.7% target, which we. communicated in November last year.. The dividend proposal of EUR4.5 per share or EUR542 million in total represents a payout. ratio of 61%, well above the 35% to 45% range we normally target for the ordinary. dividend. Overall, this keeps the payout ratio in line with prior years, and confirms our. commitment to dividend continuity even in an extraordinary year like 2020. The fact that. we ultimately decided to increase the ordinary dividend by EUR0.50 is a reflection of the. positive earnings momentum we're anticipating in the coming years, and hence shows. that we feel comfortable enough to raise the benchmark for the ordinary dividend in the. future.. Finally, as mentioned before, we have omitted a special dividend for 2020 because we. expect continued positive pricing momentum, particularly in the PandC business lines, and. we want to be optimally positioned to take advantage of further growth opportunities.. The profitable premium growth in 2020 and our investment activities are the main. reasons for the record high operating cash flow of EUR3.2 billion, the strong cash flow. more than compensates for the negative effect from currency translation, resulting from. the appreciation of the euro. Additionally, the increase in valuation reserves supported the. growth in assets under own management to EUR49.2 billion. This development is of. particular importance in the current low yield environment because the growing asset. base partially helped us to mitigate the impact from lower investment yields.. Looking now at our capital position. Shareholders' equity increased by 4.4%. As you can. see, the net income was more than sufficient to cover the dividend payment in Q2. And. within the OCI, the positive impact from the decrease in interest rates is more than. compensating for negative effects from currency translation. On the left side of the slide,. you can see that the capital composition is more or less unchanged, apart from the. increase in shareholders' equity. We have therefore maintained the high level of flexibility. around our hybrid capacity.. On the next slide, as mentioned earlier, the return on equity is highly satisfactory, bearing. in mind that the group absorbed EUR1.2 billion COVID-19 impact. At 8.2%, we actually only. slightly missed our target of 900 basis points above risk-free. On the right hand side, you. can see that despite the challenges the reinsurance industry was facing over the past five. years, we have outperformed our ROE target, therefore, the 11.7% average of ROE for. this period remains quite pleasing, even more so if we take a look at a comparison with. our peer group on the next slide.. On the one hand, this slide confirms the high profitability, low volatility profile of Hannover. Re. And looking at the five-year average the spread of almost five percentage points. versus the industry average is significant. On the other hand, industry returns over the. past five years again highlights the need for further Improvement in reinsurance pricing.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in some more. detail.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Happy to do so. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll move directly. onto the segment reporting starting on Page 10. I will start with the development of our. Property and Casualty business group.. Gross written premium grew by 15.8%, adjusted for currency effects. All three regional. markets; Americas, EMEA and APAC contributed well to the diversified growth. In the. specialty lines the growth was most significant in our agricultural business. Altogether, the. development was driven more by Property than Casualty business.. Looking at the large loss situation for Hannover Re, the loss expenditures from natural. catastrophes and man-made losses were moderate overall in 2020. This allowed us to. absorb at least a part of the EUR950 million COVID-19 impact that Jean-Jacques was. mentioned earlier, within our large loss budget. Still, the budget of EUR975 million was. ultimately exceeded by EUR620 million or 4.4.% of net earned premiums. Adjusted for. this budget overrun, the combined ratio would have been pretty close to our target. combined ratio of 97%.. As Jean-Jacques mentioned, in spite of this accelerated reporting of losses in the fourth. quarter, we kept the level of IBNR at a very high level, 65% actually, to be precise. Even. though there remains uncertainty around the loss situation, the additional reserving,. particularly in the fourth quarter, has reduced the risk of further additional reserving in. 2021. So the high level of IBNR still provides significant headroom for actual claims to be. reported.. The runoff of our reserves was positive. In 2020, we have seen particularly positive. developments in the underlying ultimate loss ratio. And since you will ask me that question. anyways, I will have a comment on our reserving level, on our confidence level. Altogether,. I would expect that our confidence level in our reserves is at least stable or has actually. slightly increased. Other income and expenses were clearly positive at EUR115 million. This. is mainly driven by positive currency effects. Altogether, the EBIT margin decreased to. 5.9%, mainly of course due to the corona loss impact on the underwriting results.. Moving on to Slide 11, total net large losses, including COVID-19 related claims accounted. for roughly EUR1.6 billion in 2020. Compared to the last 3 years, as you can see, the. difference between the gross and net loss is significantly smaller this year. This can be. explained on the one hand by the COVID-19 losses, which are only partly triggering relief. from our retrocession program. On the other hand, our ILS business was less affected. due to the more moderate loss situation on the NatCat side.. On page 12, you can see that the first part of our large loss list shows a certain frequency. of NatCat losses. However, the severity was limited overall and only one loss, the socalled derecho storm event in the U.S. made it onto the triple digit numbers for our net. account. The second largest event was Hurricane Laura, however, altogether at EUR484. million natural catastrophes were almost EUR300 million below the allocated budget.. Moving on to Slide 13. On the man-made side, the port explosion in Beirut accounted for. EUR87 million net, but even including three other property losses, the total impact for the. year was below our man-made large loss budget. Looking at the numbers for COVID-19,. you can see that the gap between the gross and net losses has further increased since. the third quarter. The reason for that is that more claims were actually reported by our. clients, hence enabling us to allocate IBNR reserves to individual treaties. And we also. take into consideration our retrocession protection, of course.. Overall, the net loss increased by EUR250 million in the fourth quarter, with further. additional reserving in casualty lines, credit and surety, as well in the area of event. cancellations. For business interruption, we have seen a mix of some increases in the loss. assumptions and further relief from our retrocession protection.. The next slide shows the profitability of our PandC portfolio by line of business. As you. can see, overall, COVID-19 affected multiple regions and lines of business, but Europe. and credit and surety were the most severely impacted ones. The weaker technical. profitability in the Americas was mainly the result of the weather-related U.S. losses,. agricultural business mainly was affected by the bushfire in Australia. On the positive side,. the technical profitability of our Facultative business as well as our Aviation and Marine. business was very favorable. Altogether, the combined ratio was at 101.6%, largely. reflecting the impact of COVID-19.. On Slide 16, looking at the development of our Life and Health business group, growth. was mainly driven by a large financing treaty in Australia. However, this was partly. mitigated by the expected reduction in premium volume due to the effect of recaptures. in our U.S. mortality portfolio as a result of our management actions, as you know, in the. previous year. Altogether, gross premium increased by 4.7% adjusted for currency effect.. The impact from COVID-19 was EUR261 million in the full year, of which 1/3 is booked as. IBNR.. The main driver also in the fourth quarter was our U.S. mortality book. Apart from this, we. expect to see some impact on our Australian disability business, as already reflected in. the Q3 numbers. Overall, the material difference between population mortality and the. effect on our portfolio continues to be visible due to socio-economic factors and a. different age structure.. Apart from COVID-19, the result of our Life and Health business group was quite. favorable. The legacy U.S. mortality portfolio performed in line with expectations. The. earnings contribution from our financial solution business, in particularly continued to be. excellent, and the results from our longevity book was also very strong. In addition, the. results from one -- at equity participation increased significantly to more than EUR80. million, and also realized gains in the Life and Health segment were higher than expected.. On a normalized basis, the EBIT would have been around EUR500 million.. The net investment income increased slightly as the EUR100 million positive one-off effect. recorded in 2019, as you will remember, was offset by the increased result from at-equity. participation, as mentioned earlier, and higher realized gains. Otherwise, the ordinary. income was favorably supported by an overall positive contribution from the change in fair. value through PandL.. Other income and expenses are primarily driven by a further increase in the contribution. from our deposit accounting, Financial Solutions business not only in the U.S. but also in. China. Currency effect was slightly negative, and at 15.2% the tax ratio is low, mainly due. to good results from subsidiaries in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate and the tax reduced. investment gains from the aforementioned participation. In the fourth quarter, as you will. see, the standalone tax ratio was higher than usual. This is mainly because of some. adjustments to loss carry forwards.. On Slide 17, as sort of as an additional information beyond the IFRS numbers, you can see. on this slide an overview of the new business written in Q4 2020, as well as upcoming. business opportunity in the Life and Health segment. Both the new business and the. pipeline business are rather diversified by regions and reporting category, but particularly. our financial solution business is an area where we continue to see very, very healthy. demand. Altogether, the value of new business for the full year 2020 stood at EUR778. million, well ahead of our full year target of at least EUR220 million. Main drivers were U.S.. Financial Solutions business and our longevity business. Additionally, we were particularly. successful in new business generation in China and in Australia.. So let's move on to our investments on Slide 19. I think it's fair to say that it's quite. pleasing to see that despite the very challenging environment on the capital markets, the. return on investment of 3% is well ahead of the full-year target communicated last year in. November. The decrease in ordinary investment is driven by a lower contribution from our. inflation-linked bond portfolio. And we purchased that to hedge inflation risks as well. And. then lower ordinary income as well diminished by some lower returns from our private. equity portfolio.. On the positive side, the results from associated companies, which is included in the. ordinary income on this slide, shows a remarkable increase by the results from that -- at. equity participation mentioned earlier. The effect of this at equity participation, just to put. it in context, was around EUR80 million in 2020. I would not necessarily call the full amount. an extraordinary effect, as it is driven by regular business but EUR80 million was certainly. more than we would have expected for the year.. Realized gains increased to EUR330 million, mainly driven by some reallocations within the. fixed income portfolio, which will inevitably trigger disposal gains in the current interest. rate environment of course. This was also the main reason for the out performance of our. own expectation in the fourth quarter. Impairments and depreciations, as you can see. here, were higher than last year, largely due to some impairments for alternative. investments. But overall, really still very moderate. Unrealized gains increased significantly. to an all-time high of EUR3.5 billion, driven by significantly lower interest rates and further. normalization of credit spreads in the fourth quarter.. On the next slide, Slide 20, you can see that our asset allocation remained rather stable. despite the volatile market environment in 2020. Listed and private equity as well as other. investments increased slightly by 1%, looking at the numbers. But these developments are. rather valuation driven and the actual numbers did not really move a lot. So in the first. quarter, as you will remember, we took advantage of the price correction on the stock. market and we carefully re-entered listed equities buying around EUR250 million of listed. equities. This portfolio has, of course, developed quite nicely through the year and carries. a good portion of unrealized gains at the end of the year.. For a few months, we have been following a passive de-risking approach with new money. being invested in high quality assets only, but we carefully started to normalize our credit. risk taking in the third quarter. The contribution to ordinary investment income is. diversified, as usual, this time with a lower share from private equity.. Slide 22, last slide in my part of the presentation, you can see that our Solvency II ratio. stands at a strong 235% at the end of 2020. This is significantly above our limit and. threshold. Even more importantly, despite the significant volatility on capital markets and. the loss burden from COVID-19 pandemic, our Solvency II ratio remained above the 200%. at all times throughout the year, proving the effectiveness of our risk and volatility. management, as well as our ability to absorb shocks. Overall, the decrease in Solvency II. ratio in 2020 can be explained by the increase in the SCR capital, the required capital. And. this is mainly driven by business growth, but also due to the lower interest rate levels and. higher market volatility.. Own funds, on the other hand, also increased driven by the strong operating capital. generation of around EUR1.6 billion. The strong capital generation was also the driver for. the improvement of the solvency ratio, particularly in the fourth quarter. The two most. important factors here were the strong value of new business in Life and Health, and the. positive reserve runoff in PandC. We will publish the full reporting in our SFCR on the 8th. of April, so I have to ask you to be patient for the full details.. Finally, just as a reminder, please bear in mind that the numbers for our regulatory. Solvency II ratio on this slide reflect, of course, only one of the capital models that we. have to consider in steering our company, other models, particularly from rating agencies. have different requirements.. So this concludes my remarks and I'll hand back to you, Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Clemens. And I'll move to Slide 24 with our target metrics, which reflects on. the one hand the impact COVID-19 has on our profitability. On the other hand, we met or. exceeded a number of targets, despite the challenging environment, confirming that we. remain very successful in growing our business, both in terms of premium and measured. by the value of new business. Also, our investment results, as highlighted earlier, is very. strong and Clemens mentioned it, we maintained a capitalization well above our 200%. target.. On Slide 26, moving on to the outlook for the 2021 financial year, I'll start with PandC. Reinsurance. Here, our expectations for volume and profitability confirm the successful. outcome of our January renewals, which as Sven and I presented about a month ago.. We're taking advantage of the improving market environment and are growing on a. diversified basis. And we also continue to expand our position in non-traditional. reinsurance.. On Slide 27, showing the Life and Health overview. The picture is a bit more diverse.. Growth is expected in longevity and Financial Solutions. In the last decade, this volume. indication also includes business, which is booked according to the deposit accounting. method and is, therefore, not visible in the premium income.. In mortality, we expect further losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in the U.S., and. hence the profitability will be impacted during the year. The premium is expected to be. slightly lower, mainly due to the natural decrease in our in-force book and our limited. appetite for new business in the most competitive segments in traditional lines in health,. particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. market.. In morbidity, the overall development is more stable.. On Slide 28, our guidance is unchanged compared to the numbers that we. communicated back in November last year and confirmed a month ago with the. publication of our January renewals information. Gross written premium is expected to. grow by around 5% for the whole group. Due to a very healthy pipeline for new business. opportunities. There's probably more upside potential to this number than downside risk,. and we expect a return on investment of around 2.4%, mainly reflecting the deterioration. of interest rate levels.. The group net income target is in the range of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25 billion. In PandC,. we feel confident about achieving our goals, particularly the combined ratio target of 96%. or lower. This is supported, as mentioned earlier, by our reserving for COVID-19 related. losses in Q4 2020, which has significantly reduced the risk of further additional reserving. in 2021.. At the same time, due to the prevailing uncertainty around the COVID loss development. in liability lines and credit and surety, we have decided to remain cautious and have kept. our initial loss ratios rather stable in those lines instead of translating the full price. increases achieved in the January renewals, directly into improved loss ratio assumptions.. In Life and Health, we have to expect further COVID losses, in particular, driven by the. expected development in the U.S., at least until we see the positive effects from. vaccinations later in the year. However, part of this development was initially already. included in the outlook, and we will see a positive one-off effect of EUR130 million in Q1,. triggered by a restructuring of the reinsurance arrangement for the ING portfolio.. Altogether, this will help to mitigate the impact from additional COVID losses in 2021.. Finally, we will continue to adhere to our general dividend policy going forward, with a. payout ratio of 35% to 45% for the ordinary dividend, and the addition of a special. dividend if our performance is in line with expectations and the capitalization of the. company remains comfortable at least the case today.. This concludes my remarks. And we will be very happy to answer your questions. Thank. you very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Question And Answer). Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) And the first question is from Vikram Gandhi, Societe Generale. Your line is. now open. Please go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hello. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. It's Vikram, SocGen. I've got three questions,. please. Two on COVID claims, one on SCR. Firstly, can I ask how comfortable are you with. respect to the BI reserves since I see the group has -- had releases over third quarter and. fourth quarter as well. I know you mentioned the retro recoveries, so is it just that or even. your view on a gross basis has improved? That's question one.. Secondly, the significant increase in other lines with respect to COVID in Q4. Can you. comment on what are the key casualty classes where you've increased the results? And if. you don't mind, the IBNR position on that bucket?. And lastly, I noticed quite a steep increase in the (inaudible) capital for the life and health. business, the SCR, and I wonder what's driving that? And now that you have a better. balance between the two businesses, why isn't the diversification benefit going up? Thank. you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much. So Sven will take the two questions on reserves for BI and. casualty lines?. Klaus Miller. Yes. Thank you for those questions. Our BI gross reserving has actually increased during. the course of the fourth quarter. So when you see that our net position has reduced, this. is mainly a function of our retrocessional position and the developments which we have. seen late in December and beginning of January, both Australia and the U.K. are baked. into those numbers. So from what we know today, this is all reflect in our reserve position.. But there are, of course, further cases in the various countries in the court, so we have to. wait the outcome on those but we have tried to anticipate the outcome when we put up. our IBNR reserves on the property side.. When it comes to casualty, we have used a rather broad brush approach when it comes. within casualty. We have just moved our provisions across casualty by a few percentage. points in order to also reflect the uncertainty from which part of casualty exactly losses will. come from. So from that point of view, it's the more general rather than specific. approach. I cannot give you the exact percentage of our IBNRs on the casualty side, but. the absolute majority of our casualty reserving is IBNR. And it is clearly above the 65%. level that Clemens has already mentioned when it comes to our overall COVID reserving. position.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Klaus, on the SCR?. Klaus Miller. Yes. The business we have written last year was in terms of risk capital, we needed or. solvency capital, we needed for that, was driven by mainly longevity from the U.K. We. have written significant number of deals last year, and the full premium volume will only be. seen next year, because this was written over the course of the year a lot in the fourth. quarter. And also the morbidity business especially CI and China, as well as the disability. income in Australia is driving this to some extent. But the vast majority is from longevity. business.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Vikram and probably briefly on the diversification that you mentioned, we do have a. slightly different approach when it comes to un incepted business and how we bake in un. incepted business in life and health versus PandC in our Solvency II numbers. So to a. substantial amount in the SCR, not in the owned funds, there we are very prudent but in. the SCR, we do reflect business that has been written on the life and health side. And on. the PandC side, when it comes to future business. We are much more prudent to bake. that into our Solvency II numbers. So that might let it appear as an imbalance but in fact it. is not.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay. That's very helpful. Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.. Operator. And the next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. (inaudible) RBC. Two questions for me. The first one is just looking at your Solvency II. ratio, obviously, you're well above your kind of threshold. So you seem very, very, very. comfortable there. But the comments about the market opportunity and the trade-off. between dividend, especially keeping, the total dividend payout at the same level as last. year or growth suggests that actually things somewhere else as far tighter? I mean, on my. calculation, a further euro dividend would have cost about two points on Solvency or. about EUR120 million. How should we reconcile that ultra-strong Solvency II? And what. seems -- what I assume is still a very strong capital, but there's some kind of constraint in. there. So that's the first question.. And on the second question, in your Solvency II ratio, and I guess, by inference in your. earnings. Can you talk about how long you expect excess debt to continue in 2021? Thank. you.. Thank you. Clemens will take the capitalization question and Klaus on the mortality?. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Kamran, happy to take the first one. So when it comes to Solvency II, I mean you've. seen that the development within 2020, of course, I mean the Solvency II ratio has. remained very stable as mentioned. However, it has come down due to the business. growth, and of course, the certain other factors, partly the low interest rate environment. et cetera. So we do expect the Solvency II ratio stay comfortably above our limited. threshold. However, it will decrease further throughout 2021. So there is headroom, yes,. but still there are opportunities out there both on the PandC and life and health side. So. we do believe that the Solvency II ratio will come further down, and then of course, we do. have, of course, other capital requirements particularly in our rating capital model as you. know, so that will partly be on the table in 2021, of course as well. We still have buffers. above the rating agency capital requirements. However, due to the strong business. growth that we are expecting in this year and in next year, we believe that that. redundancy will decrease further risk out.. On the Solvency II -- Okay. You're welcome. On the Solvency II, Klaus will briefly comment. on that. We've actually baked in some of the expectations into our Solvency II calculation. as well.. Klaus Miller. You had a question about the excess debt, what we expect for 2021. And as Clemens. said, we have partially taken that into account when we calculate our Solvency II numbers.. But in general, the gross claims are currently already decreasing globally not in all. countries, but they are decreasing in the U.S., they are decreasing in the U.K., our two. most important markets. They are still increasing in Brazil right now for the time being. I. would even expect that incidence rates might still go up or be on a very high level for. quite a while but with the vaccination being on its way, especially, in the U.S. and U.K. and. all the developed countries, I would expect that the debt claims come down significantly. would expect that the excess debt you would really see in a statistically significant way,. both in the population mortality as well as the insured population will disappear.. not completely disappear that easily. But I have some serious hope that in the third. pandemic cover, as you know, we talked about that a year ago, which might kick in, in the. sheet, but still volatility can be high. Does this answer your question?. Operator. So the next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi, there. Thanks. I can't speak on behalf of Kamran, Klaus, but I think you did answer this. question. My questions are first of all, could you just update us on U.S. liability reserves, I'm. talking ex-COVID? I think in 2019, you added a little bit or you took a little bit of. conservative action on loss picks on U.S. liability in Q4, '19. What was the kind of year-end. round up of having looked at that in 2020 ex-COVID?. Second question is a simple one. Could you remind us how big your TIPS portfolio is, so. your inflation-linked bonds portfolio is? And what tenor it's struck at? I think it's five year,. but I can't remember.. The third question is an nerdy one, on Page 29 of the annual report, it shows an incredibly. high economic return for life and health, 18% which is a bit surprising given the COVID. claims depressed life and health. So why is that so strong on an economic basis? Or is. that just reflecting very strong new business and a very strong economic performance of. are different from the IFRS performance? Thanks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Andrew. So we'll start with the U.S. liability reserves ex-COVID.. Klaus Miller. overall run-off result of our U.S. long tail portfolio was stable. So we didn't see a. particularly upward downward trend of our reserve requirements and then therefore we. decided to stay at the level we were at the year end 2019 in relative terms.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. On the inflation-linked, you wanted to have the volume, right, Andrew?. Andrew Ritchie. And what duration you struck at? So well, what -- I'm keen today where I should look on. Bloomberg to market-to-market?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. On the volume roughly really in market value, we're talking about it's mainly euro and. U.S. dollar, and the volume is roughly sitting within our government bonds is EUR4.5 billion.. And the duration is really spread out Andrew between all sort of duration. I think the bulk. of our duration would sit in within roughly 9 to 10 years.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. And you -- sorry, you markup to market through other -- there is mark-to-market. through the P&L isn't it?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes. Exactly I mean that's the element sort of baked into the inflation linkers and that flows. through both the amortization as well as the yield flow through our ordinary income.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. That's what you see in that the impact in 2020, particularly, in our ordinary income.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks.. Klaus Miller. Andrew, I did not quite get your question on the life and health.. Andrew Ritchie. Well, I noticed in the -- you give us the intrinsic value creation in the annual reports which is. given on Page 29 and the life and health number looks exceptionally strong, I think it's. 18%. Why was it so strong given --. Klaus Miller. This is the basically the value of new business, which is reflected here, that's one thing.. And the other is also the actual to expected number for some of our business was. extremely good. We have been very conservative with some of our financial solution. deals, where the client had the opportunity to recapture the business in the first couple of. years. And because clients didn't do that, we now reflected the full profits from these. treaties for a longer time.. Andrew Ritchie. So it implies, there's a dramatic difference in the economic and the IFRS performance in -which there always is I know because of new business, but there's even bigger difference. in--. Klaus Miller. Yes. You can easily argue that we had EUR260 million of COVID claims, this was cash out. of the door. On the other hand, we had nearly EUR780 million of value of new business.. This is future profits, which will come in, in the next couple of years. So the financial. solution business was extremely successful, especially, in the fourth quarter and we. expect that this continues in 2021. And this means you can argue whether we really. benefited from COVID on the financial solution side, because there are problems for. clients not necessarily by -- for paying claims, they all can pay their claims, but on the. financial side, the financial markets are an issue for our clients and reinsurance can help. and did help.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay. Thanks very much.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Andrew, I would like to specify the question on inflation linkers. Just looked it up in terms. of duration, for our euro portfolio it's roughly nine years average duration, and for the U.S.. dollar portfolio, it's seven years.. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. So my two questions, one is more like a. follow-up and one is on reserve release. So one is -- the first one is, what -- in which. scenario would -- if you're looking one year out now on a special dividend. So how -- what. needs to happen for this special dividend to come back next year. Is it that the market. stabilized? Is it that the rating agencies are a bit more over latched? Or just wanted to. hear your thoughts on which scenario you think it can come back the special dividend?. Second question is just on the run-off result, which is a bit lower than last year, I mean. premium to percentage terms 4%, is not completely unheard of, it has happened in the. last six, seven years ago as well. But just I was wondering, if there was any degree of. conservatism there, we will keeping that number low because you thought you'll wrap. ahead for COVID or frequency pick-up or something, so just wanted to hear any thoughts. on this lower reserve release run-off number? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you for the question. I'll take the first one. I think we didn't change the overall. policy, we keep it for 2021. In the current circumstances looking back at 2020, we looked. at an earnings situation where we're lower than usual. We looked at the capital planning,. which we briefly talked about with the positive outlook particularly the momentum in. PandC, but also the opportunities we've seen in the structured space. So that was the. consideration and we felt that the EUR4 which we announced late during 2020. There was. a bit on the low side, then instead of having a special of EUR0.50, we decided to go for. an increase in the ordinary dividend.. My sense is that we have a better grasp for the exposures from the COVID pandemic.. We have a better view on the profitability of the incoming business and the outlook. So. when our -- if our expectations are in line then I would say, special is absolutely in the card,. so no change in our appreciation, and my sense is that EUR4.50 is our benchmark for the. ordinary going forward and very much hope that we can consider a special dividend if our. predictions come through by the end of the year.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Vinit on the run-off results, I would probably call it is roughly EUR600 million for 2020. I. would call it, let's say, a normalized result also reflecting, of course, the level of prudency. that we've built into our reserves as mentioned earlier that we believe that we've slightly. increased our redundancy level. And particularly when you look at the recent years prior. years particularly we -- that included our reserve releases of course. Last year that amount. was roughly EUR240 million and that is included in last year's number. So if you take that. out, I think it's pretty much on the same level, I would assume.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thanks very much.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Thomas Fossard. Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of question on my side. Just to come back on the Solvency. II special divi and growth. Maybe one additional clarification to understand. I'm trying to link. know that this was not probably the time in the year for you to change guidance. But. maybe you could give us a bit more hint on the premium evolution, especially, since it. looks like you're focusing more on growth this year and you achieved the plus 8.5%. premium growth at the 1/1 renewals?. The second question will be related to two major events, which potentially took place in. Q1. Maybe you could shed some light on how we should think about the Texas winter. storm Uri. And also if on the credit side, you might have some exposure direct or indirect. exposure to greenfield and what's going on this side? And maybe the last one, if you. could quantify how much was the buffer on the SandP rating, the capital buffer over -- I. don't know if in the past you mentioned it as a above AA or above AAA, but any guidance. would be interesting? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thanks, Thomas. Then we'll get started.. Klaus Miller. On the growth outlook for PandC, as you will remember, we guided for PandC that we. should go 7.5%, it was less growth than 5% on the life and health side. So overall, we are. coming up with a 5%. We had a good start to the year with the 8.5% growth. At the 1st of. January renewals. We have Japan, Australia, and U.S. renewals ahead of us. All those. areas were impacted by losses in the recent past, so we are optimistic that we will. continue to see good levels of rate increases this year, which should further support our. 7.5% target for PandC. And in addition to our structured reinsurance colleagues are also. working on a rather full pipeline of additional opportunities.. Here we are always careful to put that with too significant amount of money into our. premium expectation. For the simple reason that us coming to a conclusion with the client. is, its a very digital scenario. We either win the business or somebody else wins the. business. So it's not a co-reinsurance situation. And even though, we are optimistic that. we will be successful with some of the prospects in our pipeline. This is not fully baked. into our numbers yet. So maybe there's going to be further news during the course of the. year.. Then you asked about Q1 losses, when it comes to the winter freeze in the United States,. we are expecting that we will have a net loss position in the double-digit -- mid doubledigit area. We are currently working on an industry loss scenario of $15 billion. And this. should result in such a double-digit losses as I just mentioned on a net basis.. When it comes to greenfield, it's still a little early to fully understand the impact of the. implications when it comes to this potential scenario, when it comes to direct. involvements according to our due diligence. We should have limited exposure through -to greenfield. But of course, their main business model was financing project and we have. to wait and see whether there are implications on the refinancing side from Greensville. further down the line. This is, of course, something which we cannot anticipate. So we. have to wait and see the outcome on the debt side, but when it comes to the direct. exposure, this should be rather limited.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Maybe we should also add, Thomas, that we don't have any exposure on the asset. management side to this counterparty just to get the full picture on it. And last but not. least the capital buffer topic.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes, on the capital buffer, I mean, I don't, Thomas, I don't have a actual number with me. right now as we are still sort of calculating the final numbers. There is still quite a buffer. above our AA minus rating, for example, on SandP. And based on the forecast numbers,. we've done a rough forecast. The predicted redundancy will, of course, decrease due to. the strong business growth. Again, it will stay above the capital requirements well above. but we really don't want to limit our opportunities throughout 2021 and 2022 as well.. That's really the reason behind it but with the upcoming renewals and the business inflow. on the life and health side as well.. Thomas Fossard. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And the next question is from Michael Haid, Commerzbank. You. line of now open. Please go ahead.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much and good afternoon to everyone. Two questions, first on life and. health. As you mentioned, the value of new business was very strong at EUR780 million.. This stands against your target of EUR220 million. Is this target still a valid target going. forward or should we assume on a normalized basis, I mean, I understand that there is a. high demand for financial solutions, which might not last forever. But on a normalized. basis, is it not the target which is too low and it's time to revise that?. Second question on the dividend, I want to understand that to what extent the regulator. in Germany played a role in setting -- in your decision about the special dividend. I noticed. that there are three other large insurance companies including your mother company,. they left or proposed a stable dividend year-over-year. You were able to increase the. ordinary dividend, that is extraordinary. And I just want to know that does the regulator. likes you more than the other ones?. Clemens Jungsthof el. Okay. I'll start with the value of new business. The EUR780 million is significantly above the. EUR220 million. The EUR220 million has been increased already for 2021 to EUR250. million. You might think that this is not that much and we -- at least would have doubled it.. But the reason for the value of new business, the calculation and we didn't just took the. number out of the air, but we had a calculation behind it. And that is the capital, which is. internally allocated to the life and health business. And this requires a -- we have to. surface capital. And if we do that with a normal business mortality, longevity, morbidity. business, then this is what we can afford probably. And this was a calculation what is. necessary in terms of value of new business to provide the return of 900 basis points in. excess of the capital allocated to the life and health business.. Now what we have done for a couple of years is and you have noticed that is, we have. shifted our focus more to financial solutions business, and some of this business does not. even require any capital but it provides capital. It's booked as deficit account, future more. or less guaranteed income, this provides alternative to capital. And therefore it looks a. little bit strange, but the problem is, if we increase to it 300 or 400, it will be very difficult. to go back at any point in time. But the financial solutions business depends on the. regulatory environment, not so much our regulatory environment, but the regulatory. environment of the client.. And when you look at the value of new business and now I just have to guess it, but I think. it's an educated guess more than 80% of the value of new business is just from a dozen. different treaties, and most of them are from U.S., China. And any change in financial. solutions business or regulation in these countries could eliminate our opportunities for. the future drastically. I don't expect that. And there are other countries, where we also do. financial solutions, but it's dependent on the regulatory framework. And therefore, we are. hesitant to increase this target knowing that it looks like it's easy to get over the hurdle. each and every year, but in fact, it's not.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Very good. On the dividend question, I cannot say if the regulator like us more than. others. But what I can say is that we have very good and constructive dialogue. We -- as. always, we had an exchange on the different key performance indicators. We looked at. the earnings projections. We looked at the Solvency level, the liquidity, the strong cash. flows which we've mentioned. But also the quality of reserving generally. And from that. point of view although we decided to increase the dividend from our earlier messaging,. the German regulators based their assessments on all these metrics and confirmed their. alignment with our views, so not an issue. The same is true for other regulators, where we. have good dialogue allowing us to upstream dividend flows to the mother company. So. not a huge topic at this stage.. Michael Haid. Very good. Thank you very much. Very helpful.. Operator. And there are currently no further questions. So I'm back to the speakers for closing. remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much. I'll be short because I think we've covered the ground very well. on the key topics. We wanted to highlight that 2020 was, of course, quite an exceptional. year. But we proved our resilience in spite of these adverse circumstances. The reserve. level for corona losses or expected losses as we said in PandC, we feel were sufficiently. reserved to cover for exposures, so no big concern at this stage from what we know, and. we feel we can protect the quality of earnings for 2021.. We see market momentum particularly in the PandC, of course, but also in the. transactional space. And for that reason we wanted to adjust our capital planning. The. guidance we confirmed it, but of course, we see in spite of the uncertain environment we. see a lot of upside. And from that point of view, I'm quite confident about the market. outlook and about our ability to outperform the market in 2021. So that would be the few. words that the key topics, I hope you gained a good overall picture on where we stand. today. But thank you very much for your participation and for the good questions.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded.

25,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Hannover Re Interim. Results for the First Quarter of 2017 International Conference Call. For your information,. this conference is being recorded.. At this time, I'd like to hand you over to your host for today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much and good morning, ladies and gentlemen also from the Hannover. team. I'd like to welcome you on our conference call presenting our results for the first. quarter 2017. As always, I'm joined by our CFO, Roland Vogel. Given that today we also. have our Annual General Meeting for shareholders, we are holding this call rather early in. the morning. But we do hope that this will not cause too much inconvenience for you.. I'm pleased to report that Hannover Re shows results in the first quarter of this year which. are fully supportive of our guidance for the entire year 2017. The top line grew for –. adjusted for foreign exchange rate by 5.9%, which was entirely driven by our P&C. business and here in particular by the structured reinsurance business written by our. advanced solution practice.. The net income and EBIT figure broadly in line with the figures recorded a year ago for. the fourth quarter of 2016 and, therefore, are supportive of our expectation to reach a. group net income in excess of €1 billion for the entire year. The book value per share. further increased by 3.6%. And nevertheless, the return on equity remains well above our. minimum target and stands at 11.6% on an annualized basis. To put these figures in. perspective, I would like to mention the following aspects which are significant for the. development of our business in the first quarter.. Firstly, received an excellent result from our investments, which is 7.3% higher than for the. first quarter 2016, and this is based on the development of our ordinary investment. income and not of the development of the realized gain.. Second, our property and casualty business was significantly impacted by the step change. in the so-called Ogden tables in the UK. This change meant that, on lump sum. settlements on bodily injury claims, the discount rate used for future cash flows have been. changed from 2.5% to a minus of 0.75%. If this change is also applicable to outstanding. claims from previous year, it means that these claims increased significantly and, as a. result of this, the loss reserves have to be increased accordingly.. At Hannover Re, we have booked additional loss reserves to take these changes into. account of €126 million in the first quarter. In the course of the year, we do, however,. expect this number to increase if additional changes in reserves are received from our. clients and also the reserves on new claims, it will also increase to the extent that they are. in respect of lump sum settlements for bodily injury claims. We have these claims mostly. on our UK motor excess of loss business (04:30) business excess of £5 million and enjoy. a market share of 15% on those layers only. We have no involvement in any lower layer.. Developments such as the changes in the Ogden rate are, on the other hand, one of the. main motivations for holding reserves which are above the actuarial best estimate which. are based on past claims experience. We will, therefore into position to offset the impact. from the Ogden rate changes by releasing reserves which are redundant according to the. various actuarial calculations. Considering the high level of reserves we are holding on our. UK motor excess of loss portfolio, we feel that we would be able to do the same with the. expected further increases in the claims due to the Ogden rate changes.. On our life and health business, we recorded an excellent result on our financial solution. business, which is partly recorded on the other income and expenses line because the. treaties are deposit accounted.. On the other hand, we saw again a negative impact from our legacy U.S. mortality. business. The result of the first quarter for our life and health business is, therefore, a little. below our expectations. Nevertheless, it is still supportive of an EBIT in excess of €350. million for the entire year.. On this note, I would like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain this figure to. you in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Hey. Good morning and thank you, Uli. As usual, I will try to keep my comments brief. This. would be rather easy this time as the Q1 results do not include too many material one-off. effects worth mentioning. I would also like to take this occasion to point out that, together. with our Q1 results, we have also published our SFCR reports for the full year 2016 for the. first time, which provides a lot of additional qualitative as well as quantitative information. on top of the solvency ratios which we have already published together with our year-end. results. You will find them on the company website where we have published the two. mandatory reports for the German entities, Hannover Rück SE, the parent company, and. our German subsidiary, E+S Rück.. As a subgroup of Talanx – or as a bonus subgroup of Talanx, we are not required to. prepare an SFCR report for the Hannover Re Group. Nevertheless, we voluntarily decided. to compile and publish the report for the group as well since we think it's a valuable. source for information for our shareholders and it also provides added transparency to. facilitate any comparison with our peers.. The favorable top line development in the first quarter of 2017 is entirely driven by our. P&C business group, whereas life and health showed a small decline in gross premium.. Overall, the premium development is in the range we have been expecting for the full. year. Net premium increased by 4.3%, adjusted for the currency effects. The retention,. overall, was rather stable compared with previous years.. As already mentioned, we are highly satisfied with the investment income, especially. because the increase compared to last year is driven by the strong ordinary income.. Other income expenses increased mainly due to the strong profit contribution from our. life and health business solution segment. FAS 113, the U.S. GAAP rule, requires a. significant part of these treaties to be booked according to the deposit accounting. method. Due to the insufficient and limited risk transfer and the profits from these. contracts, therefore, show up in the other income lines of the P&L. Just for the sake of. complete this year of (09:32) the tax rate is in line with the expected range.. On the next slide, cash flow continues to be very positive, driven mainly by good results. on the underwriting, as well as on the investment side. Assets under own management. increased to roughly €42 billion. In the first quarter, FX effect had a positive impact of. almost €170 million, rising valuation reserves of around €230 million and on top of the. positive cash flow.. On slide 4, if we look at the capital side, we feel very comfortable with the low level of. outstanding hybrids also because it gives us significant flexibility to issue more. We have. explained that before. The shareholders' equity increased by 3.6%. On the right-hand. side of this slide, you can see that the change is driven by the asset valuations and the. currency translation partly offset each other on balance in the first quarter of 2017.. Therefore, the increase is mainly driven by the positive earnings contribution.. For the P&C segment on slide 5, P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 11.3%.. On an FX adjusted basis, this is mainly driven by the successful new business written by. our structured reinsurance team and fully in line with our reporting on this year's January. renewals.. Additionally, we have enjoyed healthy demand in property lines in several regions around. the world, also leading to a further diversified growth, that was partly offset by reduced. premium income here in our home market in Germany. Net premium earned increased. favorably by 8.8% adjusted for currency effect on that basis.. At 6.2% of net premium income, the major losses were again below the budget in the. first quarter. The underwriting result is on a good level as the combined ratio of 95.6%. comes in below the full year maximum target of 96%. As in the previous years, we stuck. to our standard practice and did not release the major part of the unused large loss. budgets and kept it as IBNR for the remainder of the year.. One should bear in mind that the increase in structured reinsurance business generally. leads to higher combined ratios as the lower risk transfer justifies also lower margins.. Moreover, profit recognition happens conservatively, usually back-loaded, which is the. reason that the initial combined ratios for the new contracts are booked remarkably. above our 96% target. And so, this inflates a little bit the combined ratios.. Regarding the Ogden rate change, Uli has already commented on this rather extensively.. Overall, based on the fact that we absorbed the effect from Ogden within our existing. IBNR, the confidence levels of our reserves should be slightly down compared to yearend 2016 but definitely still on a very comfortable level. Apart from the Ogden, the run-off. reserves on balance did not include any other major effects and came in, as usual, slightly. positive.. Ordinary investment income was slightly above expectations, mainly driven by a strong. contribution from private equity and real estate, realized gains rather low, and the result. of normal portfolio maintenance, which means that, as in the past, we did not actively. harvest unrealized gains from our fixed income portfolio.. Other income expenses decreased to minus 24%, mainly driven by negative currency. effects this time. Altogether, net income for P&C segment at €215 million, up by 5%. compared to an already good first quarter in the previous year. Major losses were. significantly higher than in the very benign first quarter of the previous year. However, the. net loss from large catastrophe and manmade events in the first quarter was still below. the expected level. Therefore, roughly €30 million in unused budget will be carried. forward for the remainder of the year.. Five losses made it onto our large loss list in Q1, the most significant event being Cyclone. Debbie in Australia at the very end of the quarter. As Debbie occurred only just before. the closing of the books, the €50 million net loss is an early estimate and, therefore,. especially by the time when we set it up, included a remarkable level on uncertainty.. Nevertheless, we feel still comfortable with this estimate especially as any increase should. be covered by unused Q1 budget and would hence not affect the Q2 budget. Just to. make that sure, we don't foresee that right now.. You might also be wondering why the relief from retrocession seems to be rather low for. U/W (16:22). This due to the fact that a significant part of this loss originates from. proportional treaties and our facultative book, and these are not covered by our K quota. share vehicle.. On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed a healthy underwriting. profitability. The main contributor to the good underwriting result in the first quarter was. Continental Europe where we did not record any sizable large losses. Additionally, the. combined ratio of our global cat business, as well as the specialty lines in our facultative. book, favorably below the MtCR.. North America impacted by a series of tornadoes and a rather large property loss.. Worldwide treaty business also affected by large losses, namely, the wildfires in China and. Cyclone Debbie. This slide also demonstrates what I already mentioned earlier. The. structured reinsurance block has a high MtCR so that the growth of the business lines of. that business impacts the combined ratio without affecting the economic profitability.. In life and health, gross written premium decreased slightly by 1.7%, adjusted for currency. effects. New business production was favorable in most areas and only the. discontinuation of larger volume, single premium business in the UK, enhanced annuities,. as well as some financing business in China is also masking this positive trend. Overall, the. premium development is within the range which we are expecting for the full year.. The result of our legacy U.S. mortality business is below expectations. Uli mentioned that. already. Apart from this, profitability is good and particularly this is true for the financial. solutions business. Given that the underwriting result of this slide also includes the income. from funds withheld, it's worth mentioning that income from funds withheld declined by. €12 million due to the discontinuation of the already mentioned financing fees.. As explained earlier, the significant improvement in the other income and expenses can. be explained by the increased results from treaties recognized according to the deposit. accounting method with a contribution of nearly €50 million in the first quarter of 2017. compared to around €15 million in the previous year. Currency effects in the first quarter. were rather negligible both in this and the previous year.. Looking at the EBIT margins by reporting category, only mortality and morbidity did not. meet the target, which is obviously driven by the U.S. mortality. The development in. financial solutions continues to be very positive. Net investment income was in line with. our expectations. And just for the sake of completeness, the effect from our ModCo. derivatives was a plus €1.3 million in the first quarter.. Looking at the investments, the development in the first three months is very satisfactory. with investment income above our return expectations for the year. Despite the lower. yielding fixed income portfolio, ordinary investment income increased favorably.. This was predominantly driven by the strong contribution from our private equity portfolio,. where some distributions – or redistributions are generally not allocated equally. throughout the year. This time, we received some significant amount in the first quarter.. Additionally, the return from our real estate investments was, again, helpful in the low. yield environment.. Realized gains, on a normal lower level as we continued our policy of maintaining. unrealized gains instead of actively harvesting them. The development of impairments. and depreciations, as well as the change in the fair value of financial instruments, did not. include any effects that I should be commenting on. Overall, the return on investments. was 3.1%. And even if that includes some one-off effects, this is making us very confident. that we will or should achieve the full year target of 2.7%.. As the development of interest rate and spreads was rather moderate in the first quarter,. variation reserves moved only slightly. Compared to the year-end, an increase to almost. €2 billion which was mainly driven by the listed equity portfolio.. The next slide shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes contributed to. the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand. side, you can see that we kept our asset allocation more or less stable in the first quarter.. And the left-hand side illustrates the very strong performance of our private equity. portfolio and the continued positive contributions from real estate.. As I have just explained, the 14% from private equity is expected to trend down towards a. more normal level over the course of the year. And I think that concludes my remarks, and. as usual, the target matrix is for you, Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much, Roland. If the target matrix I think confirms a good start into 2017. financial year, most profit targets being achieved, also, it's noteworthy again that the. return on equity target is well outperformed and particular also the return on investments. is significantly higher than we have expected. Also quite notable that, again, we have hit. the growth target on the property and casualty line, so there is some growth back in the. business after 2016 where the top line was developing more sideways.. If we then come to the treaty renewal at 1st of April or, to be more precise, January 2nd. to 1st of April 2017, you can see that we have up for renewal €964 million of premium,. which dropped by 4.9% to €917 million. The main reason for this drop is basically twofold.. One, we had relatively large motor quota share in Japan, which was purchased for. solvency relief necessities and no longer necessary that was discontinued.. And secondly, on the U.S., we had a treaty that was rolled into another broader treaty,. which, on balance, we didn't lose any premium income there. But, of course, with this. rolling in, this treaty was not renewing at 1st of April and, hence, it's not recorded here. It's. recorded as discontinued here.. Otherwise, I mean, treaty renewals 1st of April reflected prevailing competitive market.. Business renewed is traditionally, in particular, our Japanese business, but also some. business from other territories such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea and North America.. In North America, we have pretty much seen a continuation from what we have seen at 1/1.. so market is still competitive. Particularly on the property side, some modest further rate. decreases. However, stabilizing trend clearly visible.. In Japan, outside the motor treaty I already mentioned, we saw a moderate softening on. the property side. But we saw some significant rate increases on the liability excess of. loss programs, and this is due to the fact that the Japanese liability market has suffered in. the past some pharmaceutical liability losses which came to notice and, for the reinsurers,. basically over the last two years, and this has resulted in some significant rate increases.. So that, in Japan, outside that motor treaty, we have been able to record some satisfying. growth of our business.. On the property catastrophe business, we saw slight decrease in volume, which again. was the reason for that the market has been relatively soft and some streamlining of. buying from major clients, which purchasing more global covers and broader covers and. also part of their coverages on a multi-year basis. This in general is a more efficient way of. reinsurance buying. It's not necessarily only positive for reinsurer, but it helps the larger. reinsurers because the larger reinsurers could provide capacity in all territories and. basically also all lines of business.. Aviation pricing pressure remains intense even though there is some hesitation of further. decreases on the direct airline business. But on the non-proportionate business, which. effectively last year pretty good results due to lack of losses, further rate decreases are. the norm. On the marine business, overall, we're quite happy with our marine portfolio. even though that it continues to reduce some size a little bit due to our very disciplined. underwriting policy there.. If we come to the guidance for 2017, it is entirely unchanged. Premium income, we are. now expecting growth in the low single digits. We're quite confident that we will actually. achieve that. Return on investment, 2.7%, is – I mean, certainly the first quarter is fully. supportive of that. Same is true for the group net income.. If it comes to the dividend payout ratio, if things stay calm and we are not seeing any. major events either on catastrophe losses or major losses nor in the capital markets so. that overall results remain in line with expectation and markets remain competitive and. soft, we will most likely also pay a special dividend for the year 2017.. If I look at the individual lines of business, we continue to expect on the target markets,. growth in North America and some reduced premiums in Continental Europe. You can. also see that we expect on both areas the result to normalize for the entire year to quite. profitable results in North America. Whilst due to the competitive nature of the. Continental Europe business, unfortunately, it will be optimistic to assume that the 80. (30:00) combined for that business that we have seen in this first quarter will prevail for. the entire year.. On marine, aviation and credit, surety, overall, results should be all right. I mean, we. expect to earn the cost of capital for the most part. Same is true for UK, London market. and Ireland, that's, however, on the provisor that the Ogden impact is being absorbed by. reducing the redundant loss reserves for the year. That will, of course, not be limited to. redundant loss reserves from the UK, but we will also probably, I mean, have to look at. some loss reserves from other areas which are, in particular, redundant as the actuaries. calculate.. Facultative, there has been some relocation of some business from facultative to our. direct business. Therefore, we see a reduced income but we expect, like we have seen in. the first quarter, good profitability.. Worldwide treaty and structured reinsurance both earned the cost of capital. We put here. negative profitability on the property cat business. This is based on the model and. expected losses which would probably be combined ratio in the high 70s which would not. be sufficient to cover the cost of capital. However, if losses developed as we have seen in. the last five years, of course, the actual combined ratio here will be very favorable, but. that will not go on forever.. If I then go to the life and health business, you can see that we expect a flat premium. income and that the profitability will be driven by the financial solutions business. That. continues to show new business on a quite regular basis. However, the majority of these. transactions are not recorded as premiums under IFRS accounting standard and therefore. the volume here is not a very good indicator of the new business developed.. Longevity, we expect to earn the cost of capital, I mean, this business line is pretty new. I. mean, it's probably written over the last seven years or so, particularly when it comes to. the pension block, and only the oldest ones are getting really in the period where the. risks can actually materialize.. The mortality business, we, unfortunately, also for the entire year, have to expect an IFRS. to see further negative impacts. Nonetheless, we expect that, for mortality, the overall. EBIT margin for the entire year will be significantly higher than what we have seen in the. first quarter. And morbidity is the kind of a right, (33:39) even though it will be a. challenged, to come to the 6% EBIT margins.. Coming to the final slide, you can see that we are still very confident that we will at least. safeguard the level of profitability above €1 billion in the short term. And that in the. medium term, we expect that we will be able to increase the profitability of our business. on the P&C side. This is largely based on the expectation that, as results gradually get. worse and/or a major catastrophe may occur, we will see some changes in the market,. which we feel we are well positioned to profit from.. In the short term, the high level of loss reserves should help us to maintain acceptable. and stable underwriting earnings. And also, I mean, we have some tailwind from the terms. and conditions of our retrocessional covers.. On life and health, due to the positive development on our financial solution business, we. expect that already in 2017 the EBIT should be excess of €350 million, and we have seen. very positive trends here on our new business evaluations.. Investments, in absolute terms, we see rather stable development. In fact, I mean, some. in-depth analysis into our investment has shown that, following 2018, we can expect that. the yield of the investments will not drop any further. On the medium term, there is some. glimmer of hope here that, actually, the increased volumes that we expect to see will also. result in a gradually increasing investment income.. This brings us to the end of our presentation and we'll be very happy to answer your. questions. Thank you very much.. Q&A. Operator. Thank you. Our first question is over the line of Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please go. ahead. Your line is open.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. So, thank you, sir. Just one thing, on the outlook on the life side, just if you could. remind us, Uli, is today's miss in the – or rather the slight weakness in the ING book. continuing? Is it causing you to be a little more concerned or are you still very bullish about. the financial solutions coming in very early or earlier than we earlier thought? So, if we just. comment a bit more on the life outlook, that will be very good.. Second question, please, on the SFCR, we have noticed in the – so, first of all, thank you. for voluntarily providing that. In the underwriting result by line, there is a workers' comp,. pretty material loss there. Is that a surprise because I thought at least in the U.S. Hannover. Re was very strong in workers' compensation?. And last question, please, if I can one. The last comment you made on the running yield. pressure going away next year onwards, is that because of the relisting that was. mentioned in the Investor Day or is that just the fact that yields are a little better or what. do you think is driving that? Thanks.. Vinit, the last question was on the special dividend?. Roland Vogel. No. That was about the running yield.. (38:28). Ulrich Wallin. I leave that to you, Roland.. Roland Vogel. I will take that, yes.. Ulrich Wallin. Let's start.. Roland Vogel. Sorry, sorry. Yeah. I think I can start with that. As we mentioned and we tried to explain. before, the reinvestment yields, as we usually present them, are the theoretic. reinvestment yields, which result if we would invest the new money exactly where the old. money is invested. And the difference between that has become remarkable.. On the other hand, you should also have – bear in mind that 50% of our portfolio is. invested U.S. dollars. We have seen increasing yields in the U.S. dollars, so that has an. impact. Moreover, we have also continued to invest a little bit more in the alternative. asset classes as was presented. So, in our projections, I can say whether it's – one or two. years down the road, 2.6% or 2.7%, but – so, overall, the actual and also expected. reinvestment yields we are looking forward do result in the running yields to stabilize. where we are.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Then I'll take the question on the life side. I mean, the first quarter, in fact, was a. little bit disappointing from the U.S. mortality. But that was the major hit that we have seen. there, but we are still quite bullish for the entire year, of course, first and foremost, due to. the financial solutions business which for the year seems to be coming in even a little bit. stronger than expected. And there are also some new treaties which are close to being. finalized.. But also, we have seen a very positive development which also should contribute to the. profitability in Asia, particularly in China where we have written some new very traditional. treaties, which are quite sizable. That is on the back of the mortality initiatives that we are. doing this South African company. Mortality Latin America business is growing very. traditional business, actually quite a lot of that is actually annual business. It's growing. double digit at this point in time, and also our French business.. So, we expect that those non-U.S. traditional businesses will see an increasing contribution. of profitability throughout the year and coupled with the (41:37) financial solution business,. which is largely U.S. but not entirely U.S., and the fact that we expect that the remainder of. the year on the legacy U.S. mortality business will not be great, but it should be a little bit. better than what we have seen in the first quarter. We still believe that we will be. comfortable like above €350 million EBIT for the year.. On workers' compensation, while – I mean, workers' compensation, we write on a nonproportionate basis, both within a person limit as well as cap. I mean, this is a line where. we just strengthen the loss reserves because we could, because other areas of the U.S.. liabilities do not lend itself so much to strengthening of the loss reserves at this point in. to defend (42:45) the reserves. That's not the case in workers' compensation excess of. loss because it's actually quite a long tail line of business.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. We are now over to the line of Andrew Ritchie at Autonomous. Please go ahead, Andrew.. Your line is open.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. Two quick questions. First of all, during the quarter, you entered the Lloyd's. market with your purchase of Argenta. I wondered if you could just give a bit of color. around that. Does that complete your long-term-held ambitions to get a presence at. Lloyd's? What do you think of the group benefits? Does it – what (43:29) start to. materially, if it all, contribute to earnings? Obviously, it's a tricky time in the Lloyd's market. as far as pricing is concerned.. The second question is a bit of a technical question, I'm afraid. When I look at the SFCR,. the difference between best estimates Solvency II non-life reserves before discounting. and your held reserves is something like €4.5 billion. Obviously, that's a larger number. than the roughly €2 billion difference between best estimate and held reserves that you. talked about in the past. Should I compare the two? Is this just a reflection of the fact that. the definition of best estimate is quite different between what you would define as your. margin versus how it's defined in Solvency II? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean, on Lloyd's, I would say the Argenta acquisition is basically driving (44:26) our. endeavor into that market. We feel it's a rather, I mean, low risk entering the Lloyd's. market because what we have at our disposal the majority of system capacity of the. Argenta Syndicate at this point in time, with the purchase, we're only getting a 21% share. in that underwriting capacity.. expecting the closing of the transaction. And on the FSCR (sic) [SFCR] (45:08) I would. hand over to Roland.. Yeah. There is a – I expected that (45:15) I must admit I think we have prepared here the. potential questions on our presentation of the Solvency reporting. The reserves you. should, of course, bear in mind that the best estimate liability will include also discounting. as well as redundant reserves. But we are not fully prepared to answer that question now. and I would ask you that we come back to that offline.. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. The only thing I would say is the difference between the reserves recognized under. Solvency II and the IFRS, it's not only the redundancy but it is also the discounting, because. on IFRS, of course, you are not discounting loss reserves, they are entirely nominal, it's not. discounted.. Roland Vogel. Yeah.. Andrew J. Ritchie. It is separately disclosed so – on page 64. But I anyway we can return back to that. Just on. Argenta, you have the right in any future underwriting year to increase your participation.. Is that the case? You could go up to 100% if you wish?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, not quite 100%. I mean, there are some things that have tenancy rights. So, I mean,. we would have to buy them out in the option.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. But we could get to the – I mean, to around 70% if it's not too much of a problem, which. syndicate if we want. But those are widely bought to gain those options.. In the short term, I mean, Argenta is largely a short-tail business. So, the risk of underreserving is not at all that high and that attracted us to the syndicate.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. We're now over to the line of Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is. now open.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. Two questions. The first one just on life business, we've seen, I guess, mortality. improvement in the UK begin to deteriorate. Can you talk about whether you factor this. into numbers here or whether we should see this in your numbers at all? So, that's the. first question.. And the second question, just on the Ogden reserves, when we think about the – your. overall reserve buffer, should we simply strip that €126 million plus the remainder out of. that reserve buffer and what impact does this have on the capital? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I think the entire effect that we have on the redundant reserves is of course then. subject to the calculation at the end of the year by the actuaries. But if you just base it on. the calculation at the end of 2016, then, yes, that's the answer. I mean, you should strip. out then the €26 million (sic) [€126 million] (48:44).. As far as the UK mortality business is concerned, we are not very heavily involved in that, I. must say, because we feel that the market in the UK is very, very competitive, and. therefore, we have only some business outside one or two direct areas which we support.. We only have some run-off business which actually has a benefit of higher rate obviously.. In recent years, we haven't written new mortality business in the UK mainly because of the. competitive nature of that business, and some of the treaties are placed for 100% and. we are not very keen on doing that because we'd like to have the seeding company. having skin in the game and have retention.. Kamran Hossain. Sorry. I probably phrased my question quite badly. I was actually trying to guess out is. there any positive for your longevity business in the UK.... Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the longevity.. Kamran Hossain. So with a little bit mortality improvements deteriorating, does that benefit your longevity. business in the UK? Sorry, badly phrased question for me.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the longevity, of course, it should have a positive impact. As I said, the result of. that is not seen in the short term because, as I explained on previous calls, I mean, if you. write one of those pension blocks, in the first, say, seven, eight years, we expect that we. will pay out the pensions on most of the pensioners but only if you go like 10 years down. the line, when if the average age stayed at (50:32) 70 when we wrote the business, at. 80, I mean, we will not pay out the pension on some of the pensioners. And that's, of. course, when the risks really start.. We are not yet in that phase, and so we would not take any benefit in our reserving on. those kind of trends at this point in time nor – and probably I shouldn't say it because it's a. little bit of a competitive question here, not this point in time we take any of the reduced. mortality improvement into account when we price the business.. Kamran Hossain. Okay. That's perfect. Thanks very much.. Operator. Okay. We are now over to the line of Jonny Urwin at UBS. Please go ahead, Jonny. Your. line is open.. Jonny Urwin. Hi there. Just a couple of quick ones for me, please. So, just on the Ogden change, thanks. for that description, it's very comprehensive. I just wondered if you got any thoughts on. how pricing in the XoL reinsurance market will develop in the UK from here?. Also, just a quick follow-up on the workers' comp specific disclosure in the Solvency II. enhanced disclosure . So, I was a little surprised you strengthened reserves just given I. much appreciated. Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. said. And claims are actually developing into the non-proportionate business at probably a. rate which is – you can consider a little bit higher than the actuaries believed, I mean,. some time ago. That's particular for regional account workers' compensation. And then,. of course, it depends what you do with this on the triangles because of, I mean, some of. the business have (52:38) period of, say, 30 years. So, a little change in the triangle and. the factors that you put in for the further development has a relative significant effect.. And as I said, as on our U.S. casualty business, we always try to make absolute sure that. we have the very conservative reserving approach. We used this – observed somewhat. higher claims than expected to change the factors, and that really resulted in the change. in reserves. And pricing on Ogden, I mean, we have in Hannover Re established, of. course, one group on Ogden that looks at the development of the loss reserves and tries. to come up with a new best estimate. But we also have, of course, pricing group that. works on the pricing going forward.. If I just look at the advised losses that we have seen up to now, and I refer that largely to. the underwriting years 2013 to 2017 because those are the ones that are mostly. impacted, we already have seen on advised losses more than a doubling due to the. Ogden claims. So, what our client advisor has already doubled, I mean, I should say that. prior to the Ogden claims arriving, we have the advised loss reserves from our clients and. advised pay claims on the underwriting years 2013 and following, we're only 27% of our. overall loss reserves. So, 73% were IBNR.. So, in theory, we could just absorb the increased advisers within our IBNR. But you can see. this doubling in advised losses may point to a doubling in premium, but this is, of course, a. little bit premature to come up with a definitive figure. But clearly on the upper layer, I. mean, the loss load is increasing significantly and it wouldn't surprise me if the final. analysis would point to expected losses on those layers at least double.. Jonny Urwin. Thank you very much. That's great.. Operator. We are now over to the line of Guilhem Horvath at Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is. now open.. Guilhem Horvath. Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one is on the reserve. buffer and I think, Roland, you said that, after the Ogden impact, your conservatism was. slightly lower than before, still very comfortable, but lower. And I like to understand what's. your strategy going forward. Are you going to be able to rebuild this buffer going forward. or do you still have constraints in terms of increasing conservatism?. And the second is on credit and surety because I see on your slide that your expected. profitability is, I would say, with a plus and minus. But I like to understand what's your view. on the claims environment going forward in this particular line of business and what you. see after primary insurers cutting a lot of their exposure. Is it improving, in your view, in. terms of the claims environment there? Thanks.. Roland Vogel. If I may comment on the redundancy level, as Uli also mentioned a minute ago, one. should assume that the confidence level will be impacted by the Ogden rate triggered. use of redundant reserves. So, on the one hand, and we've mentioned that before. various times, we are at the upper boarder anyhow. So, there was not too much room for. additional conservatism. So, if you now ask, will we be able to kind of restore the previous. stays very, very low. So, we might be able to restore some of that.. Overall, I think we have added to redundant reserves for quite some years, and it would. not be a concern if that is not the case. It would even make our auditors a bit more happy. than they were. So – and again, we're talking about a stock of €1.9 billion, and the number. we mentioned here is not that high up to now. In that regard, we still feel very. comfortable.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, on the credit and surety business, I mean, overall relatively positive. I mean, we had. losses in the past years from some of the emerging market credit business that, on those. treaties and on the trade credit side, terms have improved for the benefit of the. reinsurers. So we are expecting better results here very clearly because, I mean, actions. being taken both by seeding companies as well as – on the reinsurance terms, are still. cautious on the surety business due to its longer nature of the original policies. I mean, it's. basically for the duration of a project.. I would say some of the emerging markets we have seen improvement in the economic. conditions which, of course, help here. But also, I would say, I mean, if I compare the terms. and conditions on the credit and surety to those that we have enjoyed in 2009 and 2010. and maybe 2011, of course, I mean, they are not nearly as good, therefore, we put the. plus, minus.. Guilhem Horvath. Okay. Thanks very much.. Operator. Okay. We now go over to the line of Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line. is open.. Ivan Bokhmat. Hi. Good morning. You've mentioned quite traditionally in your outlook statement that. your capital decisions will take into consideration solvency levels. So, my first question. would be on whether you can update us on how your first quarter solvency might look like.. And the second question is regarding the investment result outlook. So, you've. mentioned that the private equity have contributed something that could be called. extraordinary. Could you care to elaborate the total volume of extraordinaries that added. to the running yield to the core? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, the first is solvency for the first quarter, it should be rather stable. I mean, of course,. we have positive development in the IFRS equity, which also fueled through into the. solvency ratio. The growth in the P&C business would not require a lot of additional capital. because it's in lower risk category being the, I mean, advanced solutions, our structured. reinsurance business. So, therefore, my expectation would be it would be rather stable.. However, the actuaries are currently working on it and we will report that in due course.. Roland Vogel. Now, when it comes to the private equity, you have to look at all the various funds we are. invested in, and it is somewhat volatile what and if they distribute. If you ask me what the. extraordinary portion of this first quarter is, I would estimate it between €20 million and. €30 million.. Ivan Bokhmat. Okay. Great. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. And we'll now go to the line of Frank Kopfinger at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.. Your line is open.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. And my first question is again on the. Ogden rate change, as you said, you expect some more impact to come. Could you shed. some light on how much more it's going to come there?. And secondly, again, also on the U.S. life legacy book, and you guided towards this, but it. remains an ongoing track on your numbers there. Is there other risks or a chance that at. some point we should expect a onetime hit that you're going to restructure this somehow. or should we expect that this keeps on an ongoing track and you're simply offsetting this. with a stronger financial solutions result?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, the thing on the U.S. mortality business is that, of course, on the IFRS, you have this. locked-in results and – locked-in reserves. And as the overall value unfolds of our U.S.. mortality business is still very positive, and that's, of course, based on the new business. that we are writing, I mean, there is no unlocking events, so to say, on that business.. That said, I mean, you will see a gradual negative impact from where we negotiate with. our clients to recapture some business that often is happening at the same time when we. announce rate increases because some clients rather than accepting rate increase they. just recapture the business.. In the past years, these recaptures normally benefited our result because we had a more. negative view on that business than our clients. And therefore, we could release reserves. in those cases. That's not said that that's necessarily the case and we would also accept. recaptures if it's a hit to the P&L just to get finality. But it's unlikely that you will see a big hit. due to unlocking the reserves overall because, as I said, I mean, it's still a positive value. enforced on our U.S. mortality business.. How much on the Ogden rate tables, at this point in time, it's a bit difficult to say because. it's a work in progress, I would say. I mean, we would come back, as we said, on our. second quarter call where we will have a very clear picture of where we are, but I would. just ask you to bear with us up until then. But I mean, as I said, it will be a figure that should. be quite manageable decision (01:04:17) our overall reserves. And don't forget, I mean,. that – I mean, the current change in the Ogden reserves that we have booked, only the. very small portion of the overall loss reserves that we actually set up on our UK motor. business.. So, whilst up to now the Ogden impact we have booked in addition to the reserves that. we are holding on our motor business, there is also quite a lot of room to book the case. reserves and take off the corresponding IBNR reserves. But as I said, more details when. we come with the second quarter.. Frank Kopfinger. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. We have a final question and that's back to the line of Vinit Malhotra at Mediobanca.. Please go ahead, Your line is re-opened.. Vinit Malhotra. Thanks for this opportunity. Just one very minor thing I noticed was that the structured. solutions volume. Maybe just semantics, but the bullishness on volume seems to have. increased even between the February reporting and now. Is it just because you're getting. more demand, or is there something more in the market that you're seeing that you can. comment on, please? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, it's just that we continue to write new treaties here largely in Europe. I mean, it's. surplus relief treaties in Europe motivated by Solvency II. And, I mean, also the production. in the first quarter has actually been quite positive and also second quarter. So, from that. point of view, we're a little bit more bullish on the volume there.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. As that was the final question on today's call, may I please pass it back to you for. any closing comments.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much indeed, and thanks for listening into our conference call for the first. quarter and look forward to see you soon and, at the latest, at our conference call for the. second quarter. Thank you very much.. Operator. This now concludes today's call. So, thank you all very much for attending. And you can. now disconnect.",20170510_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2017-5-10_FS000000002351015793.pdf,2017-05-10
26,"Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's Hannover Re International conference call on. the 1st of January 2018 PNC treaty renewals and guidance update 2017 and 2018. For your. information, this conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Good morning. Thank you for dialing into our conference call on the renewal at 1st of. January for the 1st of January 2018, as well as updated guidance on the 2017 calendar. year which is based on the current status of our book-closing activity.. Important note to start with, figures are based unless otherwise stated, on underwritingyear basis. Details are based on our portfolio and may not be indicative for the market. development. Price changes are on a risk-adjusted basis. And all changes are based on. constant foreign exchange rates.. Coming to the reinsurance market, 2017 was of course dominated by the natural. catastrophe losses which reached levels well over above $100 billion for the insured. losses because you'll remember the hurricanes Harvey, Irma. And Maria. Then we had. large fires in California in the Fourth Quarter. And an earthquake in Mexico. And also a. typhoon in -- or cyclone in Australia. The overall loss load was very comparable to what we. had seen in 2005 and 2011. And therefore of course it was expected that we would see. similar reactions on the reinsurance market as we had seen at 1/1/2006 and 1/1/2012.. Directionally that actually was happening in fact. However, the capacity of the reinsurance. market remained at a very high level because none of the participants in the market. reduced their capacity, if anything people were looking to apply larger capacities. As a. result, there was no dislocation in the market. And the market remained quite. comparative. This meant that the rate increases were a little bit below what some. observers might have expected.. However, due to the reported results after nine months, which for the reinsurance. industry were not all that great, the market was quite disciplined. So we saw rate. increases on loss-affected programs, some of them double-digit and as before for most. of the business was actually the floor. Some loss-free business also saw modest rate. increases. However, taking it all together, the pricing quality of the reinsurance business as. a result of that increased as compared to 2017.. As I already said, the capacity was still there. If you look at the ILS market, of course it. participated in the 2017 losses. Therefore some of the invested funds were lost. Other. were tracked on programs which potentially are hit by the losses, therefore the collateral. could not be released. But the investors replenished the funds and even the ILS market. got more money than it had in 2016 which meant that right at the end of the renewal. season, the ILS market became quite aggressive because we needed to invest all those. money.. Also the traditional re-insurer whilst being hit by the losses and one might say that the. overall results may be somewhat disappointing if you compare to previous years,. nonetheless most traditional re-insurers pretty much stayed in profitable territory.. Therefore there was no immediate need for significant changes in the market.. Demand for reinsurance has gradually increased, which was positive, in particular. aggregate excess of losses. But also multi-line, multi-territory, multi-year coverage were in. demand and that of course (inaudible) the launch of re-insurers that are active in all lines. of business on a global basis.. If you look at our results of the 1/1 renewal season, we were quite pleased with the. outcome. We felt that in a market condition that showed modest improvement with our. competitive position, we were quite well-placed to take advantage of that. This is based. on our very strong client relationships, some of them dating back for many decades. Also. our client relationship activities paid off. And our slight competitive advantage due to our. low expense ratio and our good security ratings actually played also a positive role.. Overall, we saw good growth of our business at improved pricing. And we also saw quite. number of new businesses, not only launch individual contracts. But also the bread and. butter business saw some satisfying increases.. As far as natural catastrophe (inaudible) we only slightly increased our risk appetite. because it was an area of continued competition. Therefore, in some areas of the natural. catastrophe excess of loss business, the pricing development was not fully satisfying for. us.. On the other side, the fear that the retro capacity would dry up for us was actually not. true, quite to the contrary there was more capacity available to Hannover Re than there. was before and as a result the risk-return profile of our retro sessions did not deteriorate,. if anything one might even argue it did improve a little bit.. But this chart reminds you that the development on an underwriting-year basis is not. equal to the development on a fiscal year basis. What can be said that on an underwritingyear basis, 2018 pricing quality provided that the remainder of the year follows the same. trend as the 1/1 renewals, will be better than 2016 and '17. But on a fiscal year '18 will be. better than '17. But not quite as good as '16 and far away from '15.. With those remarks, I would hand over to JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber, our Chief Operating Officer. for our P&C business.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Yes. Well thank you very much. Uli and I will now go into details on our P&C 1/1/2018. renewal. You can see that out of the EUR 10.1 billion P&C premium, round about EUR 4.6. billion was up for renewal. And we usually report only about the treaty renewals on the. traditional business and as we introduced it last year, we will also have a short report on. the structured reinsurance as this has been a growth driver in the last years.. So basically 65% is up for renewal at 1/1 of for traditional business. And the highest share. is in the specialty lines worldwide. Here, 79% are up for renewal and the lowest share is in. the global reinsurance, the EUR 967 million represents only 46% of the total global. reinsurance.. If we then look at the remainder of the year, what is yet to come, we have the important. one for renewal. But also the very important 1/6, 1/7 renewals. We have 11% during the. months of January to April to renew and another 16% to renew from April to July. But it is. not an even picture. For example, if we take continental Europe and Germany, the lion's. share actually renews at 1/1 and there is less to come throughout the year, whereas if you. look at the U.S., we still have a meaningful part to come at 1/4 and 1/6, 1/7 renewals. So as. far as the U.S. is concerned, we report roughly about 50% of the treaty renewals at the 1/1. renewed call.. So what has happened? I mentioned EUR 4.6 billion was up for renewal and we saw. canceled and restructured business of 7.8%. This was a drop of EUR 364 million and a very. large portion of our business was actually renewed, 92.2%. This shows the stability and. the retention rate and the reliability of our account. And in this renewed business, we saw. a variety of aspects. Of course our shares increased by 0.5%. So we had a favorable line. allocation and also were able to increase our shares, we saw changes in price to the. extent of 1.4% and change in volume -- underlying volume changes all leading together to. an increase of 5.3% on the renewed business.. In addition. And I will explain that in more detail, we were able to restructure and actually. write new business to the extent of 15.3%, all adding up together to 112.7% or EUR 7.7. billion assuming that all the later renewals are unchanged. You will notice that for the first. time we do a price change assessment here for the entire portfolio which we haven't. done in previous times. And I will explain later what we have changed as far as the. proportional price change assessment is concerned. But before I do so let me go into the. details a bit more.. We have broken down our universe of P&C business in the traditional blocks of business,. you are used to them already and first let me highlight and this is supported by the blue. color, the premium changes. And you see that except for aviation, we had positive. premium changes at the 1/1 renewal and these premium changes were, again the. exception is aviation, higher than the price changes. This highlights the fact that we like. and believe we do well in terms of cycle management. So we try to grow the portfolio. faster when there are positive price changes. And of course if we don't see price. changes, then we should be shrinking the business faster than the negative price. changes. The example is aviation here.. In total the premium changes amounted to 12.7%, I mentioned that already, or EUR 570. million around about euro increase in P&C premium. The comprehensive price change. across all lines, all types of contracts pro rata and excess of loss is 1.4%. But let me. highlight a few of the price changes already. You can see in the marine sector, the price. change is 5%, quite meaningful. Many of the marine lines of business of course were. affected by the HIM losses, Harvey, Irma and Maria. And the same you can see as far as. the excess of loss business is concerned, again 5.2%.. In those segments we grew faster in terms of premium volume than we actually grew just. from the price changes. And let me highlight in addition the change in U.K. and Ireland and. -- market direct, an increase of 14.4%. This is of course, if I call it like this, Ogden-induced,. i.e. the significant increases in U.K. motor business has helped this premium increase. significantly. As far as worldwide treaty reinsurance is concerned, the 35.3% is a. combination of many impacts, to some extent we grew nicely in continental Europe. But. we also had attractive partnership enhancements, if I call it like this, big quarter share. deals or agreements to actually grow on blocks of nonproportional treaties with some. selected customers. So in total 12.7% with an average premium change of 1.4%.. Now if we go one step deeper and divide the assessment into proportional and. nonproportional business, I should mention first why do we feel able to, for the first time,. comment on the proportional price changes. In the past, we always said let's not. speculate, let's not talk about what is yet to be underwritten as far as primary companies. are concerned. But we developed a methodology to establish this price change for. proportional business.. We compare the ultimate loss ratio peaks of the year 2017, with the loss ratio peaks of our. underwriters and partly modeled of 2018. We are then adding in the change in. commission terms and profit commissions, i.e., what has happened as far as the. reinsurance terms are concerned. Then we look at the total of the two, i.e., the expense. changes and the loss ratio peak changes and the result is then the price change that we. indicate here in the proportional segment.. Of course, it includes present value calculations, it takes into account yield changes, it. takes into loss cost trend factors and model changes and validation of models. So it's a. very comprehensive assessment which is of course open for some subjectivity if I call it. like this.. So when you look at the overall change in the proportional business, it is 0.3%, not too. much actually. And you can see that as far as North America is concerned we have a. negative price change here and as a result the premium actually drops off faster than the. price change, i.e., minus 1.4%. Continental Europe proportional, here we have grown into. some attractive motor long-tail business opportunities and our underwriters took the -yes, the opportunity, the business challenge to grow the business. To some extent this is. actually -- and I will get more details -- has occurred in Italy and other parts of continental. Europe.. U.K.-Ireland you can see proportionate price change 12.6%. This is a combination of many. things. It is to some extent property business, to some extent financial lines business and. of course also what happened on U.K. motor, i.e., the changes that occurred in the primary. business and the conditions that occurred. As far as nonproportional is concerned, the. price change is 4% overall. And let me just highlight the top line North America plus 1.9%.. We grew by 12.8% by the means of diving deeper into some specialty lines and also. carefully and constantly growing our risk-excess book.. So this was very pleasing to know that we were able to penetrate the U.S. North American. market carefully and selectively deeper. Also endorsing our cycle management is what. you can see on the aviation side, the price change is minus 0.2% and the premium. dropped off minus 5.9%, i.e., we dropping off premium faster than the price change, that. is what you do when you're not completely satisfied with the changes. As far as U.K. and. Ireland is concerned, plus 20% price change, plus 26% premium change.. We had hoped for more premium change. However, not all our expectations were fulfilled. as far as required increases on U.K. motor were concerned. And so we decided not to. support every motor treaty that we had written before because we felt the price. increases were not commensurate on occasions.. As far as the catastrophe business is concerned, cat XL price change plus 5.2%, increased. 7%. This was to be expected, it is not an aggressive push for business because top down. we have not allocated more capital to this business segment as already highlighted and. therefore, the room to aggressively push for increase was limited for our underwriting.. Of course when you look at the bottom line plus 13.8% premium increase versus 10.1% XL,. one would have expected more increase on the nonproportionate premium. However,. please bear in mind that the proportional increase is skewed by the fact that they are. large (order) shares involved and this distorts the figure. Without these order shares, the. premium increase on the nonproportional would have been meaningfully bigger than on. the proportional.. If we look at the price change over the last renewal seasons, we have given you. information what has happened at the last 1/1 renewals, this is 1/1 renewals only and you. can see that we moved up 4% here which brings us back to 97.6% of the levels which we. had in 2011. 2011 if you strip out the spill overall of the large catastrophe losses was a. decent premium volume and this is why we are very satisfied with the outcome of the XL. pricing at this renewal. Also when you check it where are we today, we are somewhere. between 2016 and 2015 underwriting-year levels on our excess of loss book. This again is. acceptable. However, in all fairness, we had hoped to reach the 2015 levels and this was. not completely fulfilled.. Looking at the overall portfolio in terms of numbers of treaties, let me remark first the. numbers have not changed much on the proportional. On the nonproportional side, they. are slightly down actually. But what we can see is on the proportional side we measure. here the change in the commission and profit commission terms.. We basically had most renewals unchanged and as many increases of commission terms. as we had decreases of commission terms on the proportional side. As far as the. nonproportional increases are concerned, we had 27% more increases than decreases.. And this is exactly the same figure what we had in 2012. So Ulrich highlighted already the. fact that also the loss patterns -- even though the losses occurred in different parts of the. world, the loss patterns were not dissimilar, yet the reaction is also very similar in terms of. what happened at 2012 and what has happened now in 2018.. Now let's have a look at North America. And you will see this picture in the greenish chart. on a regular basis we are now dividing the changes on the renewal portfolio into changes. in shares, changes in price and in volume. The shares are down, we did not too. aggressively push for business, it's a more conservative capital underwriting approach.. Price impact 0.6% and volume impact 2.8% and of course the new and canceled. restructured business gave us some tailwinds too. So we are up in total by 5.9%. The key. driver is nonproportional business. Proportional business has come down. We were able. to further strengthen our position as a preferred business partners with many of our. business partners through the fact of active traveling, regular contacts with our customers.. And there was also a lift in the organic growth, i.e., our partners actually grew and seeded. more reinsurance premium.. The U.S. property book saw a mixed picture. We had some losses of business. But it was. compensated for by restructure programs and new purchases. So in total we are satisfied. with the changes of the U.S. property business. And again, this business is exclusively. written by our brokers. The signed line allocations were very much in our favor.. The U.S. casualty premium increased mainly due to new business. This has been in various. sectors, be it worker's comp, be it special casualty, some personal umbrella business and. also we were able to actually maintain and increase our position in the MedMal business.. Canada for the second year now saw increases following the Fort McMurray losses, also a. pleasing development. In total, as we said, plus 5.9%. Please bear in mind this is only half. of our North American portfolio. The other half is yet to renew throughout the year. In. terms of the numbers again, you can see that on the proportional side we had more. improvement than deteriorations of commissions and the change of the nonproportional. treaty as measured by the rate online, 40% more improvements than deteriorations.. This is much stronger than it was in 2012. But 2012 there were no events in the U.S., there. were as you recall in Thailand and New Zealand, in Japan and therefore the increase was. an indirect one in 2012 as far as the North American portfolio is concerned.. Moving on to continental Europe, again a conservative strategy. The share is down 0.2%,. we did not push aggressively for shares. Positive price impacts and even more positive. price impacts on the volume side and tailwinds on the restructured business too. Most. pleasing to note, Germany, you know Hannover Re is quite active in motor business in. Germany and also has lots of proportional business. Price increases, my colleague incharge Michael Pickel highlighted to me the fact that the motor price in Germany in the. primary business increased by 3.5% and on the background of this the excess of loss. rates stood stable. So we also saw increases in terms of premium on the nonproportional. motor business in Germany. Hannover is not a big writer of higher industrial business. But. this was surely a pleasing outcome as far as motor business is concerned.. In Continental Europe, again, strong developments. I referred to Italy already. We saw an. increase in our portfolio in Italy. But also in Western Europe, in particular France, the. business development was pleasing and a stabilization of pricing in Eastern Europe has. helped to show an overall significant increase in Continental Europe plus 8.7%. Again to. highlight the fact shares are down, we did not aggressively grow in continental Europe.. Marine, probably, the most pleasing outcome in terms of prices, plus 5%. And whilst. Europe and Asia stood largely flat, the London market with no claims activity was up 5%. and those businesses in the London market that saw some claims activity were up to. 20%-plus. Nonetheless, we discontinued some small accounts. You see here again a. decline in the shares. So slightly down. But overall plus 6.2%, mostly price driven on the. marine side.. Going on to aviation, this account is by no means as large as it used to be in 2002, 2003.. It has declined significantly over the last decade and we are reporting about a relatively. small portfolio these days. We cut back a number of shares, 1.5%. The price in total was. flat and the volume impact was negative 2.6% mostly because of lower estimated. premium on the proportional treaties. So in total, we saw a reduction of 3.3% mostly. because of volume and reduced shares, once again supporting our underwriting stands. as far as cycle management is concerned.. Moving on to credit and surety and political risk, these days the business distribution in our. portfolio is round about 65% credit. That used to be lower. It's 21% surety. And it's 14%. political risk. That has changed over time. Surety used to be higher, political risk used to. be lower and credit used to be lower too. Again, we are not aggressively moving towards. higher premium, shares down 3.3%, price increase 1.1%, volume increase 4.3%. This is. largely driven by one particular partner out of the large organizations worldwide and that. has fueled the volume increase significantly.. We saw new business opportunities, very pleasing development in Asia in particular. More. and more companies are opening up towards this line of business and that has allowed us. to grow with these new business opportunities in total plus 4%. So again we were able to. retain our significant position as an important player in credit and surety business.. U.K. London market and direct; now you see the difference, here we have a push in the. shares plus 2.3%. So we felt that in particular there are meaningful opportunities in the. London market in the property business. But of course subject to price increases also in. the U.K. motor business. So we moved our shares up, we had a price increase of 2.8% and. volume driven increases of 7.8%. So a very meaningful movement.. The rates on U.K. motor in our portfolio are up between 60% to 70% and it would be. incorrect if I would say we are completely pleased with this. We had hoped for an increase. of round about 100%. However, the 60% to 70% is meaningful enough to basically satisfy. ourselves in terms of the pricing quality as far as the settlements of bodily injury claims in. the U.K. motor are concerned following the Ogden changes. So we think that if the. settlements take place around a discount rate of 0% or plus 0.25%, these rates will. support with an adequate profit margin the overall BI claims settlements.. In total up 14.4%, this is a clear reaction that the London market has responded positively. to the opportunities and challenges. Also pleasing to note that cyber has gotten bigger. over time. Our cyber portfolio in the U.K. moved from EUR 31 million to EUR 92 million and. for the total of the Hannover Re group from EUR 122 million to EUR 193 million. So a. meaningful development on the cyber business and I remember we had hoped one day. this account will be as big as the D&O and we're moving towards this particular. development. So we are very comfortable with this.. As far as the worldwide treaty reinsurance is concerned, again, a push for shares, plus. 3.9%, based on positive price movements and supported by positive volume movements. up 35%. We do have more partnerships in Australia, we have an increasing number of. relationships with Chinese customers. You will recall that about two years ago we cut back. severely on Chinese business, not being completely satisfied with the payback. opportunities following the Tianjin loss. But we saw some promising reaction in terms of. price movements. But also margins movements so that we have decided with preferred. customers to move our business relationship upwards and the Chinese business. expansion has supported our worldwide treaty reinsurance quite meaningfully.. As far as the Caribbean islands are concerned, we saw good improvements here. We. have not significantly expanded our writings in the Caribbean islands because there was. sufficient capacity around by the ILS markets. But also by the traditional reinsurance. markets. So any premium increase we saw in the Caribbean islands actually enhances the. margins, i.e., the profit margins because we did not deploy meaningfully higher. aggregates. And we're looking at a margin quality or price level quality between 2010 and. 2012 as far as the Caribbean islands are concerned.. Middle East and North Africa, still a high competition and we discontinued a few sizable. accounts because these markets are regarded as diversifying markets and there's an. oversupply of capacity, still pushing hard on improved terms, not all these terms did. satisfy us. In total we are up 35.3%.. Going on to the cat business, again a careful push for higher shares on those businesses. that, yes, satisfied us in terms of cost of capital margins, price increases plus 5.2%. This is. a bit an assessment figure because it was not that easy to calculate this price increase. because between 2017 and 2018 there had been lots of model changes and lots of. validation adjustments as far as some of the peak zones in the world are concerned and. we tried to assess that as much as we could. But it was not like-for-like -- an easy like-forlike assessment to figure out these price increases. Volume increases negative here.. Expectations not completely fulfilled, that is what Uli said before that's why the board of. Hannover Re did not grant a larger budget for writings of cat business. And the growth is. a combination of underlying portfolio growth, change of program structures and some. positive movements on global programs. Our risk appetite, i.e., the capital we deployed. very much the way we like to deploy it.. Let me now report on structured business. We started that last year because it fuels our. top line quite severely. The structured business encompasses of surplus relief contract,. aggregate multi-year, multi-line contracts and of course cat excess of loss treaties to a. limited extent with special features. We were able to grow this business again, mostly in. North America and Europe. And in Europe, Germany and the U.K.. So nothing has changed. And it was again driven by capital cost optimization and capital optimization. So most of. the contacts are with CFOs and not (inaudible) managers. And the impact on the. Hannover Re combined ratio could be anywhere between 0.6% to 1% up because this. business cruises along with combined ratios 97% to 100%. And therefore has a diluted. impact on the combined ratio of the traditional P&C business. Yet it is ex RoCA or IVC,. cost of capital accretive, it deploys less capital, it positively adds to our diversification. because large blocks are quarter shares on a net basis, i.e., they are protected by the. reinsurance (inaudible) and it earns above cost of capital returns.. When you now look at the total of our 1/1 renewal, if I solely carve out the 1/1 renewal and. look at our treaty business only, i.e., the structured treaty business and the traditional. treaty business, we are up altogether by 21.8%. If we assume for the remainder of the. year and also for the facultative and the ILS business which is mostly fronting business that. there won't be no change, we are up 12.9% on the total. But I'm sure we will later. comment on what happens at the later renewals as well.. And with these remarks, I would conclude my detailed summary and pass on to Ulrich for. the updated outlook.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, JÃ¼rgen. To sum up the renewal and what does it do for our 2018 financial. year expectations as far as volume and profitability goes, you can see on the volume side. that we are up in most areas with the exception of aviation and facultative due to some. restructuring of the allocation of business. And we believe that we could -- we will earn. the cost of capital in all lines if the large losses behave with the exception of aviation,. particular more than the cost of capital we are expecting in North America, continental. Europe and our facultative business which continues to be -- to show good profitability.. If you then look at the 2018 guidance, we didn't change that from November. As far as the. gross written premium is concerned, we are now pretty certain that we will have doubledigit growth on our P&C business. But on the life & health, we see a more stable. development so that the expectation of a single-digit growth still holds through even. though it will be the upper end of single-digit.. Return on investment 2.7%, this assumes only limited amount of realized gains because. prices -- I mean interest rates are moving upwards. So unrealized gains are coming down. a bit. But we are pretty confident that this 2.7% should be reachable looking at our current. investment portfolio which provides the lion's share of that return plus the expected new. investments.. Group net income, we are confident that we should reach more than EUR 1 billion should. the larger office remain within budget of EUR 825 million and short -- we see no. dislocation in the capital markets.. Dividend payout ratio unchanged. Also we would still consider to pay a special dividend. because the capital ratio based on Solvency II remains above our limit and threshold. If we. look at the 2017 year, this is based on our current book-closing activities which based on. previous year's expectations -- the previous year's experience we would not extract lot. changes from that. We see a growth of the premium income of 9% to EUR 17.8 billion,. currency-adjusted so that unchanged currency rate, the growth would have been 11.2%.. Return on investment 3.8%. That is on the one hand due to the increase in the ordinary. income by -- in excess of 10% which is largely the result of good performance of our real. pronounced was the growth in the extraordinary income because as you know in the Third. Quarter we sold our quoted equities and that gave it a boost of more than EUR 200. million.. Group net income is around $950 million which is below last year, it's also below our initial. expectation. But considering the natural catastrophe losses that we saw in third and. Fourth Quarters, it's still an acceptable result in our few, it's also slightly higher than our. revised guidance of $800 million which we provided you with when we knew about the. hurricane losses and earthquake losses in the Third Quarter.. Dividend payout EUR 5, will be the recommendation of the executive board to the. supervisory board and the AGM and the split will be again 3.5% ordinary dividend and. 1.5% special dividend.. With that, that concludes our presentation and we look forward to your questions. Thank. you very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes Johnny (technical difficulty).. Unidentified Participant. Just 2 for me please. So firstly on the renewals, I mean, just looking at the sort of early. reports so far from the U.S. and from Europe, it looks like a lot of the more traditional. established carriers have taken market share, you guys included a little bit today. Has. there been a flight to quality do you think from (inaudible) to sort of the better. established traditional carriers after the losses of 2017? Any color there will be great.. Secondly on just thinking about FX, could you give us a steer on how we should be. thinking about dollar weakness for the P&L and the balance sheet?. Ulrich Wallin. Well if I may take the second question first and then if you can answer on the more. complicated one being your first question. Well of course we have seen a significant. course has kind of a negative effect on all the profits we generate in the U.S. dollar. currency. But overall I would say the -- I mean the exchange rate that we have is not too. it's probably there or thereabouts and therefore we feel that the influence in the extra. double-digit millions in euro terms. But we feel that that should not have a significant. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. As to your question flight to quality, of course when you go back the last five years you. can see that the large traditional carriers are gaining market share as do the smaller. carriers, whereas the middle segment has not gained market share worldwide. We. believe that this is due to the fact that when you are very large and when you are. specialized, you can offer deep highly selected service quality and that of course creates. glue and retains the customer. So yes, there is a flight towards quality and that has. continued. And the second aspect of course is that more and more companies also. induced by the capital regimes do measure the capital allocation towards the quality of. the reinsurance, i.e., the credit counterparty risk charge and this also supports the flight to. quality as the larger carriers tend to have on average, tend to have the higher ratings and. still enough headroom to allocate larger shares. So yes, we have this observation that this. trend is continuing.. Operator. Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie.. Andrew James Ritchie. So Uli, you talked about having renewed your retro program, maybe you could just clarify. the broad outline of that program, is it similar to previous years? I noticed related to that. you haven't increased or so far at least your net large loss budget 2018, I appreciate you. haven't increased your cat business. But your overall large loss exposure must have. increased because the books increased. So maybe clarify why that hasn't changed in. why do you think demand has increased because it's not what we've seen distressed at. this location at the primary level either. And you talked and referred to the fact you. thought demand has increased. I'm just curious, I mean because the worry would be the. recent demands increased is that the primary insurers are trying to lay off problems that. they foresee in the underlying book. And I guess just a final question on tax and the tax. regime in the U.S. has changed since you last talked to us. How do we think about that in. relation to how Hannover structures its business?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, Andrew, I would like to leave the first 2 questions to JÃ¼rgen and would then do the. tax question myself.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Yes, Andrew then let me start with the retro program. Hannover has basically a couple of. retro programs. There is this quarter share covering our nonproportional writings on cat. business, aviation and marine. We have slightly increased the placement. In absolute dollar. terms the increase is more meaningful. It's about $600 million these days. The placement. share is round about 44%. We have renewed our whole account contract which provides. round about EUR 280 million of cover. But we have significantly increased a protection on. an aggregate basis that protects our large loss budget as far as net cat exposures are. concerned. And we moved this up by more than or roundabout EUR 100 million and this is. exactly the reason why you don't see an increase in the large loss budget. One could. have assumed with somewhat higher sums insured of our primary companies may be. slightly higher lines of Hannover Re, the large loss budget should have increased. But the. budget is for net account and takes into account the gross model losses minus of course. theoretical recoveries from our retro programs. And if you take this all into account and. also a trend that actually we had in 2017 what I would call a less severe manmade loss. year, we to the best of our capabilities assessed that the large loss budget should not be. altered. So it's a combination of what have we written, how does the retros work? And the. retro, in particular this protection on the NatCat exposures on an aggregated basis is. closer to the risk, which means it kicks in earlier and has a more meaningful impact on the. large loss budget than covers that we previously purchased. Then the last hour of our. purchases is the specific retros. They are purchased as needed as far as marine and. aviation is concerned.. Andrew James Ritchie. I mean, aggregate is normally quite expensive. But I mean you have managed to enlarge. the aggregate on reasonable terms on basically.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. No. We actually had to take more money out of our pocket. So we had to pay a higher. price. But we purposefully did do so because some of the price increases of course paid. for it and we believe that the overall mechanics justified to pay a higher price while. stabilizing our net risk appetite.. Andrew James Ritchie. And just to be clear on the K-vehicle, it's $600 million of capital -- $600 million of capital in. K plus obviously the loss with the premium to get the total loss absorption capacity?. Ulrich Wallin. Get through.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Yes. Yes.. Ulrich Wallin. So this is a very attractive business for our retro session as I would say. If we go to the tax. question, U.S. tax reform did not have any significant effect on our P&C business because. if you write that cross-border and the cross-border business that is not going to affiliated. companies is not affected by the tax reform. The only effect there might be that it. becomes slightly more attractive to write the business from the U.S. to the lower tax as. compared to Germany. But we are not changing our business more or less this point of. time. On the life side it's different because due to XXX and a XXX reserving, historically. large part of our U.S. business was ceded to Ireland. This is now subject to (inaudible) and. will not be continued. Therefore luckily we have a U.S. taxpayer in Bermuda that is not. subject to U.S. regulatory accounting. But it is subject to U.S. taxes and therefore. (inaudible) is not applicable to that company and that will take the place of the Irish. complicated. But this U.S. taxpayer in the U.S. which we established some three years ago. for other reasons, we are in a pretty good position.. And Andrew, I have to apologize, I forgot to reply on demand of -- for reinsurance. Well. various drivers, we highlighted already the fact that there are new inquiries coming into. the structured reinsurance solution-driven direction. This is driven by more a deeper. usage of capital models, be it Solvency II. But also the rating agency models seeing. adjustments on a regular basis. But we also noticed a trend towards some top-up covers. and some of the buyers in the States had to realize that they increased their retention too. much. So they bought sub-layers or aggregate covers because they maxed out their. retention underneath their cat program several times, hitting them on a net account basis. more severely than what was budgeted for and that also fueled demand.. Operator. The next question comes from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. Two questions please. One is on the guidance of 2018 which when it was introduced in. November, the idea was that any market hardening is not being built-in and given that the. market hard -- or the price increases were not as much as you would have liked, is it still. the case and just to hear your thoughts on with this guidance is still viewed as. conservative? That's the first question. And second question is I was just curious about the. commentary around the shares and I noticed that it's being down a lot in -- even in noncat. areas, I mean. So whether we started with North America or continental Europe or even -I know marine has the cat effect. But could you comment a bit about -- because that's not. probably where the ILS was trying to hit you. So if you could comment a bit about the. shares, that will be great. And just if I can also add one more on the 2017 Fourth Quarter. being such a strong -- close to EUR 400 million net income, is that due to large runoff. movements, could you comment on that please?. Ulrich Wallin. On the guidance for 2018, of course it now includes the expectations of the price. increases that we have seen. So it's a little bit more comfortable from a P&C side than it. was I would say in November. But I mean it says more than EUR 1 billion. So that allows a. little bit of range anyhow. There's still some caution on the life & health side due to our. U.S. mortality business where we have continued in-force management which might result. into further recap shares from our clients, which could result in some IFRS losses for the. year, economically positive for us. So we have catering for that as well. Then on the 2017. Fourth Quarter, yes, it was pretty good. There were positive development on the loss. reserves. But the quality -- the confidence level was quite stable. Any further information. on that of course we will have it all for you in every detail on the 13th of March.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Vinit, on the shares, I don't have a precise answer right away. But I have certain. assumptions, let me put it this way. So if I look into those segments where we have. positive share movements, here we think everything is right, we're pushing for larger. shares, we're quoting and leading and when we are quoting and leading, we offer our. shares, usually higher shares and we insist on full allocation, i.e., line (inaudible). So here. the share increases materialize. In the other segments where we are happy with the. business. But we don't want to get into a massive increase, we just accept signings as. they occur and then sometimes when there is enough capacity, the signing could fade by. half a percentage or something and this is my assumption on what happened in these. other segments. This is the only explanation because had we been pushing, we would. have been allocated always the lines we want. But as I said we're not pushing in these. segments and then it happens when there is normal kind of oversupply of capacity as. Ulrich Wallin. And if I may add in general, we would never be prepared to decrease the pricing for. larger share which some of our competitors do. But we would never do that. I mean if you. have a larger share, we want a higher price rather than a lower price.. Operator. The next question comes from Kamran Hossain, RBC.. Kamran Hossain. One question for me, just tell me about these renewals. You mentioned back at your. Investors Day and there was some last year that you thought pricing would reach 2015. levels, clearly you haven't quite got there. But with momentum continuing into rest of the. year especially into the mid-year renewals, do you think we'll reach that 2015 level, any. thoughts or color would be really helpful?. Ulrich Wallin. My answer to that will be a clear no because the overcapacity remains and correct me if. I'm wrong, JÃ¼rgen. But I would expect that the midterm renewals, they pretty much. follow what we have seen at 1/1/18.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Yes, I agree and disagree at the same time if I may Uli. I'm on the underwriting side. So my. hope is towards 2015 and that is still the internal steer. But the market dynamics of course. point towards what Uli said and we have to see what the outcome is.. Kamran Hossain. So I guess we'll wait and see.. Operator. The next question comes from Guilhem Horvath, Exane BNP Paribas.. Guilhem Horvath. First one is on casualty and it looks like you've been growing quite significantly your. casualty exposure. What do you see here in terms of claims inflation traits, can you discuss. what are the latest signals on that? Then the second question was on return on. investments. So you discusssed the fact that you would have quite lower realized gains. next year at least. You will not reproduce the listed equity areas gains, that's for sure. But. can you discuss the running yield evolution going forward? Are you already reinvesting. higher than running yield and do you see somehow an accretion there?. Ulrich Wallin. Well as far as the investments is concerned, on the U.S. dollar, many other currencies we. invest higher than we reinvest the funds. On euro, that's not the case because either it'd. be keeps the interest rates low and will most likely continue to do so. For the running. yield, it's stabilizing I would say.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. And as to your question on casualty and claims trends, first let me remark, we are not. really overly severely growing on casualty unless you describe motor as casualty. So the. key driver of our gross is rather motor than casualty. As far as the claims trends are. concerned, there cannot be a straight answer. We divide claims trends by line of business,. by country. And in the states even by state, i.e., that is a big metrics with lots of details. An. average figure in the U.S. would probably a claims trending off round about 4% for. casualty, however the question is not the claims trend. But is the price trend moving. ahead of the claims trend. So you have to compare the two. And what we're seeing is in. motor business in the U.S. that price is ahead of claims trend, whereas in casualty, it's a. very diverse figure and can only be answered state by state. Then the next aspect is of. course that claims trends have 2 components, one is the inflation and the other one is. what we call social inflation. Internally we separate these 2 trends and we have to realize. that there is a negative correlation between the claims trend and the social inflation. So. when one is high, the other one is lower and vice versa. Only experience tells us that we. are probably on the high side as far as our internal pricing models are concerned as far as. the claims trends in general, yes, are looked at. One last remark, in general, I would say. they are up around the world because we see developments towards higher wage. increases, we see, yes, a good economic development and both these aspects points. towards an increase in the claims trends.. Ulrich Wallin. So there's a -- the reason why we didn't write any of the large U.S. casualty quarter share. treaties, particular not if they include components of excess casualty.. Operator. The next question comes from Thomas Seidl, Bernstein.. Thomas Seidl. Question on pricing. And I'm puzzled by your comment very satisfactory. If I am not wrong. you include interest rate change. If you strip out that your price increase would be. probably 0.5% to 1% which on a nominal basis is much less than the average market. So it. seems like you have opted to grow and sacrifice a little bit of the average margin. (inaudible) January 1. So if you could comment on that. Secondly on retro session, you got. significantly hurt last year retro prices are up 5% -- 15% at January 1, yet you say you. improved the risk-return margins. How is that possible is my question? Are your retro. session was so happy about the last 10 years of profit that they -- happy with flat riskattractive pricing. And the third one on U.K. motor you say 60%, 70% price increase that is. based on an Ogden rate between 0 and 0.5 at midyear we have seen one U.K. company. reporting a 30% price increase. And so I wonder basically how much you have to cut back. on U.K. motor here?. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Well if I may answer first, I can understand your surprise so to say that we speak about a. very satisfactory renewal, whereas it appears that the increases don't seem to skyrocket. in a sense. But we work and that is correct on a discounted basis, i.e., we take into account. the -- what we call risk-free rate of return yield and we include that and have done so. And. all the comparisons we did comparing it to 2011, comparing it to 2015, 2016 cycles and the. attritional losses there seems to indicate that our technical prices are fairly solid. And. therefore we speak about a satisfactory renewal as a combination of prices and top line. growth and having said this, Ulrich highlighted in his presentation the fact that we believe. we earn our cost of capital, when you look at the respective page, you find lots of plus. minus, which means cost of capital, you find 4 plus signals, which is we're earning more. than cost of capital and only one minus in the aviation segment. So when you do the math. it seems to indicate a fairly reasonable and healthy pricing environment on an. underwriting year basis. That's why we speak about a very satisfactory renewal.. Ulrich Wallin. And if I may add there, I mean of course the nominal increases are larger than what we. show here because these are risk-adjusted figure. And normally, due to inflationary. trends, the underlying exposure increases from year-to-year, which means that the. nominal price, price changes are higher. I mean we even have treaties which we see. negative risk-adjusted price changing whether it's a premium growth in the session.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Then on the retro, yes, it looks as if we have accepted a squeeze say higher cost on the. retro side as against lower price increases on the primary or on our in-boundary insurance. side. This is right at the first glance ignoring how close you are to the risk and I mentioned. that one cover that we expanded is very close to the risk and on a risk-adjusted basis. we're doing no worse on the retros than we actually do on the inbound business. And. indeed our retro sessioners are not unhappy, if I call it like this, because neither did we. post unusually high losses to our retro sessioners in 2011 and 2017 will not be a completely. unpleasant experience either. So in a way, yes, they take into account the positive. balance, the credit balance they have on their dealings with Hannover Re and allowed us. on a risk-adjusted basis to find a fair balance in terms of the retro pricing. Talking about. U.K. motor, yes, of course there is a big variety of price increases, there were 100%. increases, there were the 30% you mentioned. And I cannot tell you exactly how much we. discontinued. But some we reduced significantly, some we discontinued completely. And if. someone would only have offered a 30% increase which would lead us having to earn at. least a rate of 2.5%, then we surely would have discontinued our participation. I would say. as a ballpark figure, we're probably off in terms of sizable accounts 15% to 20% of our U.K.. motor writings as far as the renewal business is concerned. But here I'm a bit uncertain, I. would have to check that more carefully.. Thomas Seidl. And do you -- just a quick follow-up on that one, do you see basically U.K. motor insurance. who buy nonproportional going for less purchase because of the higher prices?. Ulrich Wallin. Not really. I mean they buy unlimited. So on the top this thing, some move a little bit more. to pro rata, that's true. But also the retentions have not changed really.. Thomas Seidl. So not moving up from the EUR 1 million to the EUR 2 million-EUR 3 million or something?. Ulrich Wallin. Not to a larger extent.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. And there's also a reason for it because the increases are not homogeneous overall. these layers. Of course the middle and higher layers had to have more significant. increases, whereas to some extent the lower layers, say one over one did not require the. same increase like 15 over 10 for arguments sake.. Thomas Seidl. And should you not get a nice reserve release if the Ogden rate comes at 0.5 in April?. Ulrich Wallin. That would be the case. But I mean if you wait and see as and when it happens. We were. a little bit disappointed I must say. I mean we had a structure on the program where we. gave a price based on minus 0.75% with adjustments reducing the premium in case of. increase in the Ogden rate. But the market was prepared to give the client the benefit of. the doubt. So clearly according to our calculation did not quote on minus 0.75%. In some. cases actually according to our calculation well above 1% and of course we had no option. then to discontinue those programs.. Operator. The next question comes from Frank Kopfinger, Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. First question is also on the renewals and coming back to this 2015 level question. I think,. Ulrich, you mentioned that you do not expect the upcoming renewals in respect to price. improvements are better than what we saw now in January. Could you confirm this and. also whether why we shouldn't expect higher pricing? Is this for the impact of the U.K.. motor business, which we obviously have now as a supportive driver for January? What. are the reasons behind this? Then secondly also on the renewals, on the price. development for the North American business in the proportional business, they show a. negative of 0.8%. Can you dig a little bit more on what the drivers are there behind this. decline and proportional North America business?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, Frank, on your first question, there is still the imbalance of supply and demand. And I. mean that will persist most likely throughout the year. And therefore I would love to see. as going back to 2015 levels. But I have -- I'm quite cautious there. Of course it will be. extremely interesting to see what's happening on the Florida renewal at 1/6 because I. mean that has -- we have seen so many redactions on Florida and of course was a most. disappointing renewal last year. So it could be very interesting to see what happens there,. for us a little bit more observing rather than participating to a larger extent because we. are very low on our Florida exposure. And on North American property -- proportional, I. would leave that to JÃ¼rgen.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Yes. Well the minus as far as the premium volume is concerned is the result of many. things happening at the same time. We had a couple of new additions of new. proportional treaties. They are usually in the EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million to EUR 20. million ballpark figures. But we also had withdrawals of similar proportional treaties. They. are mostly quoted shares and not surplus treaties and the minus 0.8% is simply the result. of these movements. We don't have one very big contract pricing.. Ulrich Wallin. I mean, you said.... JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. You talk about pricing?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes.. JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Sorry, (inaudible) about pricing.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. It was about pricing, the.... JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. Okay. The -- the proportion of pricing. Yes. Well here I probably struggle to give you. correct details because we have so many lines of business in the U.S. Yes, I -- probably we. have to take that offline so to say and I have to contact the North American treaty. department, why exactly minus 0.8% I struggle here to have the details at hand.. Operator. The next question comes from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays.. Ivan Bokhmat. It's related to the structured reinsurance bit. It's now almost a quarter of total P&C. volume. I was just wondering if you did any estimates on the overall market size and. what's Hannover's share in it. And I'll have few follow-up questions on the same. I was. wondering whether the rate on those structured reinsurance, did it in any way benefit. from the harder or stabilizing market? And finally you mentioned that there are some. diversification benefit, how much more for that do you see considering the already high. share in the mix?. Ulrich Wallin. Well let me start with the market size and try to answer that. The market is not very. transparent. Many of these transactions get placed as private transactions and one. reinsurer takes 100%. So this is not always that transparent and only with a delay factor. you can assess that in the States where it is published in the (Yellow Books) and you find. out if you go company by company how much of these transactions were actually placed.. Having said that, Hannover has a history of more than 30 years and all the large players. are involved. And we of course hear from time to time who are the participants or the. competitors. They are usually 2 or 3, not more than this because these treaties don't get. offered around the market. And I dare to say with this kind of structure probably one. would have to say our shares should be north of 10%. But again this is guesswork since. there is no full transparency and the encoding is always different in various companies.. Some actually allocated to their traditional business and others carved it out like we do as. structured reinsurance. So my best take would be that we have a significantly above. Hannover Re worldwide average market share, yes. That is all I can say. Does it benefit. from a hard market? No, not really. These kind of structures are driven by other dynamics.. The demand gets created by capital models, it of course competes with the pricing of. traditional markets. But it also competes with other types of financing, i.e., the spread for. corporate bonds. So if the spreads for corporate bonds are high, say for argument's sake. 300 base points, 400 base points, 500 base points above risk-free, then the demand is. increasing. This though right now is not the driver. So I would dare to say it is optimization. of capital costs and it is uncorrelated to the market cycle in the hard or soft traditional. market.. Ivan Bokhmat. And on the diversification benefit?. Ulrich Wallin. On the diversification benefit, yes, it adds benefit. It is of course (inaudible) correlated to. P&C. But with a factor quite deviating from plus 1 closer to the 0. However -- and what is. the driver? The driver is that mostly these covers are net account quoted shares. They. have less volatility. But they still have the same volatility like the traditional P&C business.. So yes, it adds diversification. But it is not uncorrelated like life business or other types of. the business, nor is it negatively correlated. It only has softer positive correlation to the. other P&C segments.. Ivan Bokhmat. And maybe putting this in the broader context, does the growth of the structured. reinsurance means that your 96% combined ratio ambition may change?. Ulrich Wallin. Well the ambition definitely not, it becomes a little bit more difficult to achieve because it. means that on the traditional business we need to be at around 95%. And -- but we think. that that's achievable because I mean we continue to have significant amounts lawfully. unchanged or if we've done loss reserves. So we expect positive development always. from the back years. Taking that all to -- into account, I think we will stay with the goal to. be 96% or below.. Operator. As there are currently no further -- speakers, I'm sorry.. Ulrich Wallin. Any further questions?. Operator. As there are currently no further questions, I will hand back to the speakers now..

27,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on January 1, 2020 Property and Casualty Treaty Renewals. For your. information, this conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Jean-Jacques. Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Good morning everyone and thank you very much for joining this call. I'm joined by the. team here. Sven Althoff will comment in more details on the renewals for 1/1, but just to. get started a few comments on my side. First of all, on the general market conditions, on. the presentation on slide 4, a few comments. Generally I would say that demand for. reinsurance continue to be strong and we saw some good momentum in terms of global. market conditions, some improvement, which reflected the loss activity in the previous. years, but also some increased underwriting discipline in the allocation of capital from the. market players and some tightening of terms. At the same time one has to acknowledge. that global capacity remained sufficient to cover the needs of the reinsurance market.. There were some withdrawals which you are aware of at Lloyd's in Asia, in particular, and. alternative capital had some challenges to face, some trapped capital which affected the. retrocession market. But generally traditional capacity was available and they were even. increases in terms of available capacity. So I would say a balanced supply-demand. relationship with good underwriting discipline and some momentum on pricing.. On the primary side, we've seen as well some improved conditions and some. momentum across the world, particularly in North America. And as you know, we have a. large book of business on the proportional side. So this will lead to some positive impact. on the expected profitability of proportional treaties and our clients in America have. reported back that they are seeing substantial increase, sometimes double digit in some. of the long tail lines of business. Nat cat market remained stable to slightly improving from. our standpoint, this is a bit below our expectations. We had some large losses, of course,. '17 and '18. '19 was a bit milder in comparison, closer to the average, but still a loss burner,. which is higher than historic average in the last three years. So, the movement up is a bit. more moderate. Retro capacity was a bit tighter and led to some tightening on the. reinsurance side, but retro capacity was available. As far as we are concerned, we are. very happy with the outcome of the negotiations on our retrocession cover and we'll be. able to reflect the slightly increased terms in our reinsurance programs. In nat cat, of. course, as you know, on April 1, we have the Asian Japanese renewals in July 1. You have a. number of North American treaties being renewed. So we'll see over the next few. months how the nat cat business evolves, there might be some increased momentum,. but it's early days. Generally, I would say, my perception is that the industry proved its. resilience and was able to react on losses. And generally we see some positive. momentum, but certainly not as pronounced as for example in primary lines in North. America, but good movement of global market conditions. Let me maybe comment now. more specifically on our own results. And I move to page 6, of the slide deck. As you. know, the 1st of January is an important renewal date. This is roughly two-third of our P&C. business being renewed and I'd say that we're satisfied with the outcome of the renewal. season. We were very well positioned from the beginning in the market as many clients. were keen to continue to expand their relationship with us. And we were often a go-tomarket when it comes to new business. There were few withdrawals, as I mentioned and. we're able to attract some new business at satisfactory terms. We managed again to. have a strong increase in our premiums level at satisfactory terms and rate increased and. reduced commissions were more frequent this renewal than in the previous year. Having. maintained the underwriting discipline, we tried to focus on our key clients as far as. growth is concerned. We managed capacity diligently and had of course some. negotiations where the result was below our own benchmarks and risk appetite with the. client, some business as well. As mentioned, nat cat -- the nat cat market was stable to. slightly improving, and in economic terms, the proportion of our nat cat exposure is in line. with the recent situation, although we've grown a little bit there. Retrocession, I. mentioned already, we renewed our whole program in line with exposure growth and we. have slightly higher risk-adjusted prices, but as mentioned, we believe we can reflect this. change in pricing into our own pricing and we were able to do so on 1st of January and. expect to see the same in the next few deadlines for renewals. And last but not least, I. think the low-cost ratio, the cost leadership, which characterized Hannover Re for many. years, continues to be a key competitive factor and allows us to, to continue to grow our. book of business. So this is just one part of the mix, but continues to be important to be. competitive in the market. So, overall, I'd say satisfying outcome. Maybe nat cat a little bit. less movement than initially expected. But we should see in the coming months if this. gains a little bit traction. But overall, we were able to meet our profitability targets and at. the same time could grow and expand our market share I give the floor now to Sven to. give you a bit more detail on our own portfolio.. Sven Althoff. Very good. Thank you, Jean-Jacques, good morning from my side as well. I will start on. slide 8, where you can see that out of our almost EUR15 billion of P&C premium, EUR10.5. billion is what we would call traditional treaty reinsurance, i.e. the proportional and nonproportional covers for portfolios of our ceding companies. We are today not reporting. about the facultative or the structured and ILS activities we have. And out of the EUR10.5. billion of traditional premium, two-thirds, i.e., a little more than EUR7 billion came up for. renewal at January 1. As you can see the EUR7 billion portfolio has a broad diversified split. across all lines, all territories, and is therefore, a good indicator about the quality of our. overall business. The highest percentage of renewals from January 1 point of view we. have from our European scenes [ph] and out of some of our specialties like Credit and. Surety and Marine business where more than 90% of our business is renewing at 1/1. On. slide 9, we are showing you from a regional footprint what we will renew later in the year,. the EUR3.5 billion we are not reporting about today. As you can see, territories like the US,. Australia or the Japanese business, which is a significant part of the EUR726 million we are. showing for the region here are coming up for renewals later at 1/4, 1/6, 1/7. These are the. territories which experienced significant losses on the natural catastrophe side in 2019. So. just to name a few, Dorian, Faxai, Hagibis and the Australian bush fire, and we do expect. higher average increases from those loss impacted areas than we could observe on. average at January 1 renewal. But let me explain the January 1 renewal in a little more. detail now. On page 10 you can see that the bulk of our growth is actually coming from. our renewal book. We lost EUR744 million of business due to cancellations or due to. restructuring and we gained new business of EUR810 million on the new business, or out. of those restructures, but the bulk of the growth, i.e. EUR919 million is coming from our. renewal book. This of course is a book we know well. In many cases we had for many. years. And from that point of view, it is very, very pleasing that we could show the growth. from that solid base at January 1 renewals. In total, we are reporting EUR1 billion more in. premium, which translates into a currency adjusted increase of 14%. On slide 11 you can. see the various reporting lines, what's their premium development and the price changes.. The overall price change at January 1 renewal was 2.3%. This compares with 0.9% from. last year's report on the January renewals, so it's pointing in the right direction. Most. regions and product lines are now trending positive. In addition, we can observe increases. and sometimes very significant increases in many insurance markets, which of course. directly translates into more premium for our proportional business. And out of the. combination of the higher reinsurance pricing higher shares or some new shares, hence. the underlying price increases on the primary insurance business, we could grow our. premium by the 14%. I have already mentioned. On page 12, you can see the difference. between the increases on the proportional and on the non-proportional business. The. proportional business overall increased by 2.1%. This was 0.8% a year ago. And the nonproportional business increased by 2.9%. Again, a year ago, it was 1.1%. Overall, you see. much more pluses than a year ago. The reporting at the time was much more mixed. And. as you can see now, most of those lines are actually in the positive territory with only two. minus areas, but I will report on those in a little while. From a non-proportional. perspective, slide 13 shows you that we had now three consecutive years of increases.. We have regained some ground. So the pricing on the non-proportional side overall is. now at 2011 level again, which of course is a good development. But you can also see that. we are not quite at 2012 levels yet. As you will remember, 2011 was a particularly heavy. year from a natural catastrophe point of view and triggered some significant repricing at. the time, but at least we have managed to get to the 2000 level, pre-losses level again.. Let me now come to the details in the various reporting lines, starting on page 14. Our. North American portfolio showed some elements of growth. This is driven by mainly the. reinsurance price increases, but also from the underlying insurance pricing. We managed. to take the advantage of certain capacity withdrawing, which we saw particularly in the. long-tail class of business, where there was less supply than in previous years and we. could selectively write some more of the long-tail exposures, again mostly in areas which. we have supported historically. There were also some new business opportunities, as you. can see. The most significant came from Canada where we have supported client on their. motor business on a proportional basis, which we felt was attractive due to the underlying. strong rate increases on the insurance side. On the casualty reinsurance side, we saw. more restructuring of programs than in previous years. So the retentions were slightly up. at times, clients also introduced annual aggregate deductibles and that's the reason why. despite the rate increases and despite the increase in shares you see relatively impact on. the volume side, because clients decided, based on the new reinsurance pricing, to retain. some of the business net, which they had previous -- seen in previous years. In the. reporting category, Latin America, Iberian Peninsula and agricultural business, the overall. price increase was 2.1%, but we have seen a significant difference here on the agricultural. side at least in certain territories. As you may have observed yourself, there was a. significant swine fever influencer in China, which impacted the profitability on that class of. business in 2019. And due to a significant repricing of that portfolio, we managed to. increase our share substantially on what we felt are now attractive reinsurance terms and. conditions. That is a bulk of the increase we are showing under this reporting category.. But we also had some growth from the property and casualty side in Latin America. Here. the main drivers are the continued strong underlying insurance growth in those. developing markets and some increased premiums, particularly in Chile, following the. social unrests, which we had in the autumn and winter of this year. In Germany, Switzerland. and Austria and Italy, we had a satisfying renewal outcome. From a pricing perspective this. portfolio was very, very stable, as expected, I can say. But we have managed to maintain. our shares, despite original signs that cedings may keep a little more net than they did in. the previous years, but they kept our share stable. We managed to find from new clients,. which is a very remarkable development given that our market share, particularly in. Germany is already at such a high level. And what we could also see is some meaningful. price increases in Italy. Italy had some hail and flood events in 2019, which we will not see. on our major loss list, because it was more a frequency than a severity problem, but it. nonetheless led to a repricing of the business and we could take advantage from that. development. The UK and London markets portfolio showed a very significant increase in. reinsurance pricing. This had a number of drivers, some of which, of course, were result. driven, but we could also see some capacity-driven drivers with syndicates at least. partially closing down or closing down in their entirety. And so that's led to a situation. where there was less supply than in previous years, and pleasingly this translated into. increased reinsurance pricing. We have on the London market book written a relatively. stable portfolio. So we used the opportunity of the price increases to work on our. portfolio composition. On some of the casualty classes we de-emphasized some of the. lower, more frequency-driven layers, so therefore we didn't increase our shares. substantially. And the same goes for the UK motor business, which is the line that saw the. most consistent rate increases. The driver for those rate increases of course was the. second Ogden rate change within the last three years from minus 0.75% to minus 0.25%,. which was below the expected change in the Ogden rate for many market participants. and translated into increases on motor excess-of-loss programs of 20-plus percent on a. regular basis. Again, we more or less concentrated on our renewal book and did not write. significantly more layers or more programs, but stayed with our clients, which we have. supported in the last couple of years. The last very significant driver behind the strong. premium increase in this reporting category is our increased support behind our Lloyd's. platform. You know that we purchased Argenta in 2017. We had kept our capacity behind. the Argenta underwriting relatively stable in the initial years, but we now saw the. opportunity to increase our position on the organic business, which from a timing point of. view, given the very strong increases on the insurance side seemed the right moment in. time to do so, plus the fact that we have invited a new casualty team to join Argenta, and. they will come with a substantial renewal portfolio. The incumbent is no longer writing that. class of business. So we would expect that we can get this business at stable or improved. terms in line with the rest of the market development in long-tail classes. Continental. Europe and Africa is similarly stable as the rest of Europe with some mixed developments. country by country. Overall, the price development was one of the few areas which still. had a slight minus with minus 0.9%. We continue to write a stable portfolio, but also used. the opportunity to emphasize some countries, some clients a little more than in the past. and we also decided to discontinue with programs that had further price deterioration,. particularly in Eastern Europe. So therefore, you can see that when you look at the balance. of new versus cancelled business with EUR3 million, this is a very, very stable portfolio with. some element of cycle management, but the bulk of the growth is coming from our. renewal portfolio, where we could particularly benefit in the increased underlying volume,. which mainly results from the better insurance pricing that our clients can achieve on our. proportional book of business. In Asia, Australia and Middle East, we had mainly the. ASEAN countries and China renewing at January 1. Australia is more a July 1 renewal. season and Japan and Korea is more a April 1 renewal season. On the ASEAN countries,. the development was more positive than in previous years, we could actually experience. some slight rate increases. Here you may have followed that some reinsurers either had. to reduce their portfolios due to rating situations they have or discontinued their business. entirely. We were able to benefit from that development by picking up some of the. shares that became available on programs which are priced in line with our expectations. and tap the market in general, because this territory was softening last year, but has now. turned the corner into a slight hardening. In China, we could benefit mostly by -- from the. organic growth of our ceding companies. The Chinese insurance market is still growing. significantly. Our portfolio is very much concentrated on the top 5 companies in the. Chinese market. They are growing in line with the markets and therefore you can see that. the bulk of our growth is actually coming from volume, i.e. underlying organic business. But. in addition to that we could also broaden some of those relationships with the top 5. insurance companies in China. So, overall, a very pleasing outcome of the Asian renewal. season. This is all fully in line with what we told you about our APAC initiative during the. Investors Day in October. So we are in line with expectations on that side. And as I said. before, with particularly Japan and partly Australia, we will have renewals later in the year.. Given the losses, we do expect very positive pricing momentum on those future. renewals. Credit, surety and political risk, again a very stable renewal, the pricing was. more or less at last year's level. We did see some price increases on the non-proportional. book of business. This was partly Thomas Cook related. We also found some new clients,. 15 to be precise, which again is pleasing, given our significant market share also in this. portfolio and just demonstrating that our client relationship activities are bearing fruit. You. may wonder why this line has not seen more significant rate increases due to the Thomas. Cook situation, but here only a few market players were impacted. Those programs are. seeing increases and this reporting line, despite Thomas Cook, is making solids in the 90s. combined ratio for our portfolio in 2019, despite the loss. So it shows you the resilience of. the pricing, even in a situation where we have a slight loss like that. Aviation and marine,. some very mixed picture. Let me start with marine. Here the market is still very. competitive. We are now at a period of relatively benign losses on the marine and. offshore energy side. From a loss point of view, there was no reason, there is no technical. reason why prices should go up, and we could certainly see that this line still has. significant overcapacities for some market participants trying to increase their market. share. So on the marine and offshore energy side, we can report about a stable pricing, at. best, slightly down, and due to that we also Part 12 lost some business on the marine side,. because we felt that pricing came to a level which was no longer attractive to us. Aviation. is a completely different story. You will all have followed the losses on both the aviation,. the product liability and on the space side we had in 2019. This hit the market, which came. through a period, a very long period of rate reductions and we guided before that we felt. that the aviation pricing was at a pricing level which was not sustainable over the long. term. And in line with our expectations given those losses, we now had a significant. repricing exercise on both the insurance and on the reinsurance side. On the reinsurance. side, we managed to bring down ceding commission levels back to 2016 levels, and on. the excess of loss side, even on loss-free programs, the starting point for negotiations. was a double-digit rate increase. So in aviation, we took the opportunity to regain a little. bit of the market share which we had voluntarily lost over the last couple of years, So the. growth you are seeing in this reporting category is more or less exclusively coming from. our aviation practice. Last but not least, the natural catastrophe business. Jean-Jacques. already commented on that a little bit in his initial remarks. Overall nat cat was relatively. flat. There was relatively little business renewing that had losses in 2019. On the business. that came up for renewal with losses, price increases were 10% or higher. So, the market. was reacting on that, but the main bulk of the loss impacted business will come later in. the year. The only area where we can say that even on loss-free business, we had more. meaningful rate increases was the US nat cat business where on average on loss-free. business we saw increases between 3% and 8%. With that I would end my report and. hand over to you, Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much Sven for this overview. Let me come now to the guidance for 2020,. first showing the usual overview on our expected profitability. From a financial year point. of view, as mentioned Part 12 Part 13 there has been some momentum in the market and. the profitability level has slightly improved. So the overall picture looks a little bit better in. terms of volume. We have a number of markets and segment where we continue to be. able to grow, as we've seen. We're trying to be a little bit more diligent when we are at. the required profitability, but not exceeding that level when it comes to renewing the. book of business. But generally an overall picture which is satisfactory from our own point. of view. And in terms of guidance, I can simply confirm that the guidance communicated. already for 2020 is confirmed. Clearly, on the gross written premium, we seem to be able. to exceed what we set ourselves for 1/1. But I would want to see a little bit more into the. year, we have some important renewal. The structured reinsurance business has not been. included yet and we need to have full visibility on that. And last but not least, the life and. health business needs to be reviewed. So it's a little bit early to change. For me, the. guidance is confirmed and there is good confidence to reach these targets. Return on. investment is at 2.7%, as you know, taking into account the interest rate level and the. Group net income target is maintained at EUR1.2 billion. We continue to feel that the. dividend guidance for this year is -- can be met. So fully confirmed on all indicators And to. close this introductory part, just a few words on our preliminary figures for 2019. In terms. of gross written premium, we were able to exceed the previous guidance we had set at. 10%, as you remember, and we achieved 15%. This is predominantly due to the P&C. business. And we have had real momentum in 2019. The return on investment is expected. to reach 3.5%, which is in excess of the 3.2%, which we mentioned last time, benefiting of. course Part 13 from one-off effects, as you know, which allowed us to improve the. performance on investment managed by Hannover Re. And Group net income is a little. bit higher than the previous guidance at EUR1.28 billion. The combined ratio is higher than. anticipated, this is largely due to the frequency of large losses. In terms of nat cat, we. were more or less within budget, but a number of man-made losses occurred last year.. Thomas Cook was mentioned by Sven a few minutes ago. The credit and surety business. is not protected by our retrocession and that explains that it went a little bit above budget. for our large losses. So 98.2% is the KPI, slightly above our target. We will say more on. these numbers as soon as we're ready, and on March 11, we'll have our con call, where will. give you full details on the figures, but I wanted to share the preliminary key figures for. 2019 this morning. With that I close the presentation part and welcome your comments or. questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first. question is from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Your line is now open.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, morning everyone. Three questions from me. The first one is just on I guess how price. improvements flow through into profitability. I guess you talked about a 97% combined. ratio last year. Should we expect some improvement there or are there any kind of. business mix impacts that we should think about when we're thinking about our numbers?. And the second question is, I kind of understand the comments around growth and you. agree 14, you're still aiming for 5, and you've said that you want to see how the year. progresses. Could you maybe talk about the pipeline for structured business? Do you. think it's as strong as it was last year, or do you think actually there were some mitigating. things here that could offset what looks like a very strong start to the year? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Happy to take those. From the business mix point of view, we have no significant. developments. So the 1st of January renewals would certainly confirm our target of 97% or. lower combined ratio. So, no change from that point of view. Advanced solutions, we have. a good pipeline, also some successes already for the '20 year. This year the pipeline is. more full with smaller transactions. The drivers are still very much the same like in previous. years; those are solvency capital model-related drivers, but it's no significant single. transaction we would be able to support on, but a good flow of smaller transactions. So. also a reasonable start on the advanced solutions structured reinsurance practice, in line. with our expectations.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks for the color, Sven.. Operator. The next question is from Jonathan Urwin of UBS. Your line is now open.. Jonathan Urwin. Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please. So firstly, could you. please provide a bit more detail on how your retro renewal has gone, any key changes in. coverage terms and conditions and prices would be great? And then secondly, what level. of price improvement would you need to see on your books to offset the higher retro. costs and claims inflation as well? It feels like 205 [ph] bps is a good starting point for the. 2020. But based on our expectation it doesn't really lead to much margin improvement as. you're kind of highlighting with the consistent 97% combined or below [ph]. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Yes, thank you. On the retro slides, I'm happy to give you a little more detail on our three. main retro covers, on the property side, let me start with our K transaction. Our K. investors are a mix of ILS markets, but also traditional insurance or reinsurance companies.. supported from the ILS market as in previous years. Luckily, we were an outlier in that. trend. So in the end we managed to actually have more capital supporting our K [ph]. transaction than in 2019. This was also required due to the underlying exposure change.. So from that point of view, depending on how you look at it, we have more support from. the capital funding the K transaction. From a proportional session on our portfolio, this. translates into a slightly down transaction, but overall very pleasing. Why are we maybe an. outlier here whilst others did find it more difficult to replace their proportional retro. vehicles? One, we have done it for a very long time. Two, we were told that particularly on. the reporting side, given our long experience, we are seen as best in class. So even if our. loss picture -- result picture is also challenging for those investors, at least we give them. the news in a consistent way and in an early way, which is appreciated by them. So they. would see a very high level of professionalism on our side. And thirdly, they would feel. that given our well diversified K portfolio we are in a very good position to take advantage. of an improving market overall. So that was K. Our aggregate cover on the large loss. portfolio, we could fully place this year. We had a little bit of a shortfall in 2019. But in 2020. we could place what we wanted to place. Retention and pricing on the -- aggregate on. large loss increased in line with our exposure growth. So from a technical point of view, a. relatively stable situation. If you look at it from the absolute numbers, the retention and. the premium is higher. And thirdly, our whole account property protection which is. covering us on and each and every loss basis rather than in the aggregate, here we could. keep our retention stable. The pricing increased in line with the underlying exposure. increase and we did buy a little more cover than in previous years. So overall, one can say. we managed to renew our covers as in 2019, or on the limit side, even slightly up at prices. which were flattish from a technical exposure development point of view. Are those retro. covers earnings accretive? I mean if you've already summarized the situation, and I. mentioned a number of times that our covers front load in proportion the underlying. growth of our exposure. So the answer is no, they are not more earnings accretive than. they were in the last year. And from that point of view, our situation has not deteriorated. on a net basis, but it has also not improved compared to 2019.. Jonathan Urwin. That's great, thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Your line is now open.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes, good morning. Thank you very much. So just if I can follow up, is the commentary that. you have provided for the man-made losses. You mentioned Thomas Cook, but again. that was, I assume, already booked in the third quarter and it was actually booked. Is there. any commentary around the fourth quarter Jean-Jacques that would help us understand,. because if you see sort of a 97-ish combined ratio is one of the highest fourth quarter. numbers in recent history of Hannover. Does it indicate the reserve relief change of. approach, does it just indicate that fourth quarter was rather heavy on man-made that you. could flag, if not on nat cat? Just some color would be very, very helpful for us. And just. following up on the retrocession effect, so this 2.3% of pricing, how should we -- I mean is. retrocession going to eat up maybe a few basis points from here, and then the rest goes. 97% please? It could be structured as well, but just wanted to hear your thoughts again.. And thanks for that.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much. I'll take the first question. We had a large loss budget, a total of. EUR875 million, and we ended roughly at EUR950 million, and this was indeed driven by. man-made. The nat cat budget was close, but within budget, and we were above budget. on man-made. So we are approximately at 109% of the large loss budget. Indeed, you are. right, I mentioned Thomas Cook, but it was actually already booked at Q3. I think the main. driver, if I'm not mistaken, would be the riots in Chile, which contributed to the Q4 results.. We will comment a little bit more in detail when we are on the phone again on March 11,. but I believe this would be the main driver if I'm not mistaken. Sven, any other man-made.... Sven Althoff. We had two fire losses in addition to that, which made it over the EUR10 million large loss. hurdle. So from that point of view, the man-made losses were well over and above the. Q4 budget for man-made losses. And given Hagibis, which we of course had not booked. in Q3, yet there was nothing spare from the nat cat side either.. But leading over to the second part of your question, I mean there was no change in our. reserving practice. We continue to significantly -- I mean with our very prudent initial. reserving of younger underwriting years, so like in 2019, also in 2020, we will reserve our. 2020 underwriting year well above our pricing view -- from that point of view, the 2.3%, I. would say, you can see as giving us confidence that we will be able to achieve our 97%. target on the combined ratio side, but it's not a development that would be significant. enough for us that we would reassess whether the 97% combined is the right target for. us.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay, thank you very much.. Operator. James Shuck. Hi, good morning. Three questions from my side, please. So if you could just comment. interested in how things might have developed in Q4, both on proportional book and the. Secondly, in terms of coronavirus, could you just speak a little bit about the rate of. maximum losses in one and 250 year events, please.. And finally just on the SCR. So the 14% growth in the January renewals, what kind of. growth in SCR do you expect for 2020 please? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Let me start with the social inflation, mainly from a US casualty perspective where I guess. you are coming from. As we have already reported in our Q3 call, I mean, there are. number of loss situations which we are observing closely, starting with the opioid crisis,. but also topics like concussion in amateur or professional sports, or the lifting of the time. bar on sexual molestation [ph] losses in the United States. Here we don't have a changed. situation in Q4. So what I said in Q3 is still the case. We are still comfortable with our. ultimate loss ratio picks, but nonetheless we have decided to book some extra reserves. over in the back of what the ceding companies are reporting to us on those loss. situations. But we did not have to significantly reassess our older casualty years due to. social inflation aspects.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I'll take the question on the coronavirus, James. So generally, of course, it's early to say,. this is still an event which we're following very, very carefully. There are some pandemic. covers in force in the Asian region. We're not participating, or to a very limited extent in. such covers. So we don't have any significant exposure from that point of view. Obviously,. the mortality business in case of an extreme scenario would be hit, but it would be really. at extreme events, which would go beyond what we experienced with SARS27 years ago.. could lead to a net loss of up to EUR150 million based on risk management reporting, but. we are very far away from that. Maybe as a benchmark we had so far 361 cases of death. as of February 2, the last number I got. If you take the normal level of influenza season,. just in Germany, you have 20,000 people who die every year. So just to put things in. comparison. So there is some business which could be affected. I think the Chinese. business, when it comes to business interruption, particularly, infectious diseases are. excluded from the covers. So this would not lead to significant exposure. The exception. would be if some of the plants, which stopped production and will restart, if there would. be any property damage, then there would be some exposure. So it's very early to say.. Medical reimbursement business, we heard that the Chinese government said they would. take over the cost of treatment for people. So we would not expect a significant impact.. Critical illness, very small exposure for us. Personal accident covers, generally, have. exclusion clauses for infection diseases. So again a bit early to say -- to make a real. substantial statement, but at this stage we would feel that the coronavirus would not lead. to very significant losses, but of course we follow progress and hope this will be mitigated. in the coming weeks. On the SCR, I cannot give you the exact figure in terms of including. the growth for 2020, but the latest status I have for the SCR is 238%. That would be. where we stand today. If you need a bit more, we might need to talk offline or might. come back to it when we meet next.. James Shuck. I guess if the renewals were up EUR800 million or so in absolute terms, is a good rule of. thumb about 100% of underwriting risk to back that if I'm to try and forecast the increase. in the SCR through the year?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Difficult to say. We might need to come back to you offline on this.. James Shuck. Okay, all right, thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Your line is now open.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi there. Just a couple of clarifications. Could you just confirm that when you talk about. proportional price changes that is allowing for any lowering of ceding commission is. included in there, I shouldn't think about the lower ceding commission on top. I'm. guessing where you saw most of the reduction in ceding commissions was US casualty. exposures. A second question in relation to that your US casualty book you've always. talked about as being mostly regional, small ticket, regional carriers, smaller ticket type. exposures. You grew the book, you indicated at 1/1. Are you happy to go up the sort of. scale curve, are you seeing attractive pricing even allowing for the loss cost uncertainty in. higher, larger value casualty books now? Thanks.. Sven Althoff. Well, we have not gone up the scale, Andrew. We have written a very similar exposure. profile. If you want to pick one casualty class where we have grown the most significant, it. would be medical malpractice, which was always a strong component of our US casualty. portfolio. So this grew from roughly 115% to 140% -- million [ph] this year. So it's a little. more than 20%. But other than that the profile of our US casualty portfolio has not. changed in any meaningful way due to the improved terms and conditions on the. renewals.. Andrew Ritchie. And on the ceding commission?. Sven Althoff. On the ceding commission, what you are seeing in our reporting, those movements are. mostly movements in ceding commissions. So what we are not really doing, at least it's. very significantly diluted is translating the movements in the direct insurance pricing into a. technical risk-adjusted reinsurance pricing. So we are not trying to do that and therefore. the improved pricing which we are reporting this year on the proportional of business is. more or less exclusively the lower ceding commissions we are paying.. Andrew Ritchie. That's why we are understating the real improvement in profitability then?. Sven Althoff. good reasons. So in relative terms that's why we hesitate to do that translation. If you get. 10% rates more, then most likely not all the 10% will directly contribute to bottom line, but. profitability on the insurance side, and as we are one step too far removed from those. calculations, we are concentrating and measuring the ups and downs of commission level.. Andrew Ritchie. And just to go back on to the -- where you are happy to grow, I mean med mal is an. example where there does seem to be a very heightened level of discussion even. amongst the smaller carriers about loss cost trends and the outlook. Do you feel the. pricing is sufficiently compensating for those loss cost trends?. Sven Althoff. Yes, we do, and I mean we have always written a selected profile of med mal business.. We are not supporting the big hospitals in a meaningful way. We are going more for the. smaller practices and we are avoiding certain professions within the medical space, which. is giving the highest exposure to the topics you were just mentioning. So we are still. comfortable with our medical malpractice business mix, or indeed comfortable enough to. even grow that portfolio again by 20%.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay, thanks very much.. Operator. The next question is from Sami Taipalus of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.. Sami Taipalus. Yeah, morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. First one just staying on the. US casualty topic, I think your book traditionally has been quite focused on nonproportional business in US casualty. Is the pricing environment, or what you're seeing in. terms of changes in the pricing environment, I guess claims dynamics as well, is it. tempting you at all to change that more into a proportional book or is this more a, I guess,. fundamental positioning that you wish to keep? So that's number one. Number two on the. results, more broadly, it looks like you've got roughly to your guidance. P&C was pretty. much in line with guidance. Investment income was a bit stronger. So I guess it suggests. that the life reinsurance technical result might have been a bit weaker in Q4 on a. standalone basis. Is there anything to flag there that we should think about? And then. finally just on your specialty business, you talked already a little bit about Argenta and. increasing capacity there. Are you seeing opportunities to grow the JV you have with. Talanx a little bit more quickly now given the improving environment in specialty pricing?. Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Yeah, I am happy to take the US casualty and the HDI global specialty part. Our profile of. US casualty business as you rightly said is more heavily geared on the non-proportional. business, but to clarify we have always also written a proportional portfolio on the. business, which on an original basis is written on an excess basis. But we have historically. de-emphasized its quota share on ground-up casualty business in the United States. Our. risk appetite has not changed, at this year's renewal, I mean in order to have a more. substantial risk appetite on the pro rata basis, we would see -- need to see more. development in pricing, in terms and conditions on the insurance side. There is positive. momentum, but in our judgment it would be too early to change our overall US casualty. strategy yet. But as you can imagine, this of course is under review, but I have no. indication that we will change our mind any time soon as we would need to see more. substantial rate increases there.. On the specialty business, the joint venture with HDI, that company can report more. significant growth in 2019. And therefore they will also be able to grow a little more in. market, to take advantage of some players closing down or closing portfolios down. So. we were able to hire teams on that side. A little earlier than we originally expected on. good opportunities. So from that perspective, the most meaningful increase on the. specialty insurance side is definitely coming from Argenta, but also the HDI global. specialty side is performing slightly ahead of plan.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And on your question on guidance, Indeed, the main driver for Q4 has been a very. satisfactory investment performance. The P&C results were affected. As we discussed,. given the overall picture, we felt that that was the level which was in line with the reality of. the portfolio. The life business is fully on track and in line with expectations. So, no new. development. The mortality trends are in line with our expectations. The US book in force. is being managed very diligently. So we're quite optimistic that we will continue to see. profitability emerge and the in-force book on track so far. So, no significant development.. Life business should meet our guidance.. Sami Taipalus. Great, thank you very much.. Operator. The next question is from Michael Haid of Commerzbank. Your line is now open.. Michael Haid. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for my questions. Two of them. I'm. interested in the dynamics of your canceled and the newly written business. So the. EUR744 million which are canceled and EUR810 million newly written, are there any special. developments or concentrations by regions or type of business in these two items? I think. you mentioned already kind of expansion in Canadian motor or I think also credit. insurance, but anything special here? The motivations why some businesses were. canceled, is it only price?. Then the second question is on volume, the EUR22.6 billion gross premiums written in. 2019, that is a little bit higher than what I had expected. When I look into the fourth quarter. then the gross premiums IFRS grew by almost 25%. Anything special there or is there an. explanation why this growth, especially in the fourth quarter was so strong, also when I. compare it to the previous quarters?. Sven Althoff. So let me take the first question, the -- outside of what I had already mentioned on. Canadian motor business, for example, or the credit and surety. There was no particular. trend when it comes to the canceled and restructured or the newly written business.. Quite a bit of the churn between the two categories is actually coming from restructuring,. sometimes clients restructuring their sessions so significantly in structure that we are. rather canceling the old contracts in our systems and establish a new treaty. So we saw. that happening this year again. I mentioned the agricultural business in China where we. have written higher shares, but also some new shares, but at the same time we have also. reduced shares on the agricultural business in other parts of the world. So no,. unfortunately, no particular trend I can report, it is just the usual churn and restructuring we. would expect in any renewal On the second question, could you please repeat the. question, I don't think I fully did get what you asked?. Michael Haid. Hannover Re, in the full year 2019 achieved gross premiums written, if I read correctly, of. EUR22.6 billion, and that was a little bit higher than what I had expected. And when I look. at the fourth quarter, the gross premiums written were EUR5.2 billion if I calculated. correctly and that implies 25% increase versus the fourth quarter 2018. Normally, I don't. looked at much at growth of IFRS premiums because it's volatile anyway, but at this time,. it's struck me a little bit that this growth in the fourth quarter was so high. Maybe it comes. from life and health, or it could come from --. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. I don't have the exact figures in front of me, but my assessment would be that part of the. answer is that the life and health business experienced strong growth in the last quarter. of the year and there might be foreign exchange translation in the mix which might. change the number, but I don't see anything on the P&C side, which would be outside of. the (Multiple Speakers). But I think life and health and ForEx might be two big drivers for. this movement. I hope it helps.. Michael Haid. Perfect. Thanks so much.. Operator. The next question is from Vikram Gandhi of Societe Generale. Your line is now open.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi, thank you for the opportunity. Just one question from my side. I heard your comment. around the complication around pricing change versus expected loss change on the. proportional business. But overall, looking at the 2.3% figure, how should we think about. the net effect, i.e., should we think about it as a risk adjusted pricing or just a nominal. pricing change figure? Thank you.. Sven Althoff. Well, it's definitely a fully risk adjusted figure for the non-proportional business and on the. proportional side it comes with the limitations I have already described. It is just risk. adjusted from a pure reinsurance point of view with outgoing -- the extra step to ask. ourselves, how much of the original insurance rate increases we are seeing is technically. required, how much is bottom line accretive. This we would not be able to do across our. entire portfolio. So it's risk adjusted from just a reinsurance pricing point of view, mainly. concentrating on the movement of the ceding commission.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) As there are no further questions, I hand back to the speakers for. the closing remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much again for participating and for the active discussion. Hope this. provided you with a good overview on our P&C renewal season at 1/1. And as mentioned,. we will be able to give you a bit more detail and granularity on our 2019 figures next time. we are on the phone together on March 11. Thank you very much and have a good day.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect now.",20200205_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_M-A_Call_2020-2-5_DN000000002787035776.pdf,2020-02-05
28,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Interim Results Q1 2016. For your information, this conference is being. recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich. Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our. conference call presenting our result for the first quarter of 2016. As always, I'm joined by. our CFO, Roland Vogel. Given that we also today have our AGM, we have this call rather. early in the morning and we do hope that this would not cause any inconvenience to you.. Coming to slide number one, I'm pleased to report that we had a very good start to 2016. financial year. Group net income increased by 12.7% to €271.2 million. If you eliminate from. last year's results the special effect from the termination fee of the financial solutions. treaty, top line development is in line with expectation and gross premiums declined by. 3.1%, forex adjusted by 2.1%. However, the net premium earned, in fact, increased by 3.2%. due to a higher retentions on our life and health business and positive change in the. unearned premiums for our P&C business.. The pleasing business development in the first quarter is driven by strong underwriting. profit in property/casualty reinsurance as well as good and solid results of our life and. health reinsurance business and on the investments side. This is a specialty gratifying. against a well-known difficult business environment. This is a soft market, in particular, on. the P&C side and the challenging investment environment with ever lower interest rates.. At 13.2%, we were again able to achieve an attractive return on equity (02:38) by further. strategic target and this was achieved despite a further increase of the IFRS capital base. by about 4%.. The book value per share at the end of the first quarter stood at €69.42, and it's, as I said,. increased compared to year-end of last year. Following four consecutive years of low. major natural catastrophe losses and very good results, the property/casualty reinsurance. business continues to be fiercely competitive. As a result, we continue to write our. business highly selective in accordance with our profit-orientated underwriting policy,. which is also reflected in slightly reduced premium volume.. I should remind you, however, that last year, we had a special effect on our facultative. business where we accelerated the premium booking to the amount of around €100. million which, of course, is not recurring this year. The overall profitability of the business,. so far 2016, is still good and certainly above our margin requirements. In the first quarter,. we continue to see good business opportunities in particular in the U.S. but also in parts of. Asia.. On the other hand, we also saw some decline in the premium income. This particularly. refers to Chinese motor quota share business, which are bought for solvency relief. reasons and for the new solvency regime, C-ROSS, does not really help those treaties. because it reduced the capital necessary for motor business in China.. With the combined ratio of 94.7%, we achieved an increased underwriting result as. compared to last year. This also then resulted in healthy growth of our EBIT to €300. million which, in fact, is a growth of 17%. You should, however, remember that the first. quarter of 2015, the property/casualty result was a little bit below average. On the other. hand, the life and health result in the first quarter of 2015 was extraordinary good.. We feel that the result is strong and this is particularly due to the fact that we didn't. change our loss reserving policy, particularly regarding the large losses. And we did not do. any active reserve releases. So, on the reserve development side, all you saw is the. normally expected positive development.. In life and health reinsurance, we recorded a solid first quarter result. Gross written. premium increased slightly by 0.3% on a forex adjusted basis. This is on the back of. attractive opportunities, particularly, in Asia and also in our longevity business. At the same. time, also here we have some lost transactions, which did not renew and in particular,. refers to enhanced annuity business in the UK, some Australian group business and also. some business that we have written in our Shanghai branch, which was single premium. business and therefore the business is on the books. But of course the single premiums. were booked last year.. Nevertheless, the favorable underwriting results resulted in an operating results of €106. million, which is a little bit higher than the average run rate of our quarterly EBIT. And we. believe that signals that the underlying profitability of our life and health business. continues to develop favorably. The drop compared to last year is, of course, due to the. fact that we have the positive one-off effect last year, which I already mentioned.. Also our investment income developed entirely in line with expectations. ROI stood at. 2.9%, in line with our target. And on that positive note, I would hand to Roland who is. actually looking after our investments.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Thank you, Ulrich. Good morning to all of you. As usual, I will try to keep my. comments as brief as possible, which, on the one hand should be rather easy this time as. the Q1 2016 results are fairly straight forward and do not include any material one-off. effects. On the other hand, we this time have included some information about our. solvency ratio at year-end which we have added to my part of the presentation.. As already mentioned, the slight decrease on the top line is within the range we are. expecting for the full year. Net premium increased favorably. Ulrich mentioned that this is. mostly due to the change in unwritten premium and not an increase in retention. Also, I. would like to remind you that the very positive premium development in 2015 was. significantly ahead of our expectations and therefore, the basis for growth for this year is. actually very high.. Investment income is in line with expectation excluding the €39 million positive one-off in. life and health reinsurance in 2015. It is almost stable compared to the previous year,. which I feel – can be seen as a success of the current year's environment. Other income. expenses decreased mainly due to less positive currency effects in life and health, and. just for the sake of completeness, the tax rate is back down on an expected level.. If we look at the capital side on the next slide, the level of hybrid is unchanged compared. to the yearend. This is a level we feel comfortable with also as it gives us significant. flexibility to issue more. We will come back to such potentials when discussing the. composition of our economic capital later on.. Shareholders' equity increased by almost 4%. On the right hand side of this slide, you can. see that the change is driven by asset valuations and the currency translation largely. offset each other, therefore the increase is mainly driven by our positive earnings.. The cash flow, on the next slide, continues to be very positive mainly driven by good. results on the underwriting as well as on the investment side. You might remember that. we had shown an adjusted number for the cash flow in Q4 2015 when we received money. from the Chinese financial solutions deal which was due to be forwarded only in Q1 2016.. As expected, we have now paid out roughly €300 million to (11:43), depressing the. reported number for operating cash flow in 2016. Adjusting for that, we had a favorable. cash flow of €584 million. The remaining €200 million difference between the two effects. will be paid out over the remainder of the year.. Assets under own management were rather stable at a level close to €40 billion. The. negative impact from FX effects was around €900 million, offsetting rising valuation. reserves of around €400 million plus the positive cash flow. In addition, the cash outflow. that I just mentioned for the financial solutions treaty, of course, led to a reduction in cash. and short-term assets.. P&C gross premium decreased by 3.7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This is the result of our. strict margin-oriented underwriting approach and is fully aligned with our expectations. following the extraordinary growth I already mentioned we had in 2015. Additionally, the. previous year's premium was influenced by a non-recurring effect associated with the. accounting of our facultative business where we booked almost €100 million in additional. premium last year.. Moreover, we did not renew some Chinese motor quota shares as well as a specialty. business from specialty lines, namely, aviation, where rates did not justify to continue.. Nevertheless, net earned premium increased by 5.2% adjusted for currency effects. As. mentioned, this is not the result of the higher retention, which actually decreased from. 89% to 88%, but it's due to the change in unearned premium. This development is driven. by the strong growth in 2015 which, as you will remember, was supported also by the. strong U.S. dollar.. At 2.8% of net premiums, major losses were again well below the budget in the first. quarter. The underwriting result is again on a very good level with a combined ratio of. 94.7%, which as you might know is well below the target of 96%.. As in the previous years, we stuck to our practice and did not release the unused loss. budget but kept it as IBNR for the remainder of the year. The run-off results in the first. three months was unremarkable. And as in the first quarter of last year, we did not benefit. from any extraordinary positive developments. The confidence level of the loss reserves. should at least remain stable.. Ordinary investment income was in line with expectations. Realized gains were also within. the normal range. These were mainly the result of structural changes within our private. equity portfolio in the first quarter, which means that as in the past, we did not actively. harvest unrealized gains from our fixed income portfolio.. Other income expenses improvement by €9 million mainly driven by currency effects.. Altogether, net income for P&C business stands at €204 million, up by almost 20%. compared to an already good first quarter in the previous year.. On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed good underwriting. profitability. The main profit contributors in the first quarter were the target markets, as. well as our worldwide treaty book and not surprisingly, our global cat business was an. outstanding combined ratio.. Also, marine is significantly below the maximum tolerable combined ratio with – also. benign loss experience shows good profitability. The good combined ratio of our aviation. business was affected by a plane crash in Russia, which was around €10 million for our. account. Additionally, we have been notified that the Chennai floods in India in the fourth. quarter of 2015 resulted in a damage to a number of helicopters and aircrafts, which. combined with a remarkable decrease in premiums, results in this unusual high combined. ratio for the first quarter.. Our facultative business was particularly impacted by a few single large losses and that. already leads us immediately to the large loss slide here on the next page. We can go. through that next slide rather quickly because, as already mentioned, major losses were. well below average on budget. Overall, the bulk of the €134 million in unused budget is to. be carried forward for the remainder of the year. Still, we should bear in mind that the. year has only just begun and we have already had two earthquakes; one in Japan and one. in Ecuador in the second quarter. And those may show up on the large loss lists for the. first half year then. And we will have to wait and see what the impact from the fires in. Alberta will be. Still, these losses should be comfortably covered by the unused part of. our Q1 large loss budget in addition to the budget for the second quarter.. Next slide, four losses made it onto the large loss list, all between €10 million and €20. million. Net cat losses, significantly below the expected level. Man-made losses, more or. less in line with expectations.. With currency adjusted growth of 0.3%, the premium development is in line with our. expectations for the full year in life and health. Adjusted for the already mentioned oneoff effect and the extra ordinary positive currency gains within the other income, the result. of our L&H business group is at the same good level as last year. Additionally driven by a. favorable underwriting result, the overall strong EBIT of €106 million is a little bit above the. normal quarterly run rate. What we have seen in the recent past that earnings here can be. volatile from quarter to quarter and therefore, our expectations for the full year today. remain unchanged.. Other income is back to normal or to more or less a normal level, which represents a. swing of minus €24 million compared to the previous year's, almost entirely driven by. lower currency gains. The overall result is also reflected in the EBIT margin for our four. categories with financial solutions and longevity outperforming their respective targets.. Mortality and morbidity came in only slightly below the 6% target which is nevertheless a. significant improvement as compared to 2015.. Net investment income was in line with our expectations and just for the sake of. completeness, the effect from our ModCo derivatives was minus €1.4 million in the first. quarter.. So now looking at the investment, the development is satisfactory despite considerable. volatility seen on the capital markets in the first three months, investment income is in line. with expectations. The decrease in ordinary investment income is largely due to the last. year's one-off effect from the termination fee in life and health. Low interest rates had the. expected impact on the return from our fixed income book as we did not change our. overall risk position here.. Realizations, at the same level as last year, with the majority driven by a structural changes. within our private equity portfolio. Despite the high volatility in the first quarter,. impairments are again on a very low level, mainly consisting of regular depreciation on. real estate. Overall, the return on investment was 2.9%, which is exactly the figure we are. targeting for the full year and as a result of decreasing yields, valuation reserves. increased from year-end to reach €2 billion at the end of the first quarter. Credit spreads. remained rather stable, at least when you compare the two balance sheet dates, as we. all know, we have seen significant volatility in between.. The next slide shows an overview of how our different asset classes contributed to the. ordinary investment income. The slide on the right hand side demonstrate that we've. kept our asset allocation more or less stable. In the first quarter listed equities are now at. 2% as we acted on the volatility in the first quarter to buy another tranche of around €400. million continuing the moderate reentry into this asset class.. At 42%, corporates have the highest share in our investment income. The contribution. from government bonds is not surprisingly a lot lower than their share in our portfolio. On. the other hand, 12% income from – 4% real estate investment is a remarkable. performance even adjusted for real estate specific costs, which are excluded here. The. contribution from private equity is a little bit below our expected run rate, also because. the development is somewhat seasonal depending on the distributions from our funds.. So now, as usually or usually Uli is the one to comment on the target metrics, but this time. the honor falls to me as I will also be presenting a few slides on our capitalization. according to Solvency II afterwards. So excluding the one-off effect in the first quarter. 2015, earnings per share increased by 12.7%, meaning that we were successful in. achieving all Group targets in the first quarter of 2016. I'm not at all concerned about the. premium development of our two business groups as these targets are to be achieved. over the cycle and for furthermore a year with less growth is absolutely in line with our. strategic target, especially in light of the strong growth of the previous year. Profitability is. favorable in those business groups.. So before going into more detail on our capitalization, I would like to make a few general. remarks on our Solvency II reporting. The figures we provide on the following slides are. for the Hannover Re Group. As a former subgroup of Talanx, the Hannover Re Group. legally is not subject to group regulation. Still, we did apply form and we received. approval for a full internal group model in addition to the Hannover Re SE model. This. group model will also be audited in line with the legally required audit for the Hannover Re. SE. We do that to give all stakeholders and clients the information they need and they are. used too in our industry.. To a large extent, the risk profile and the capital position for the Hannover Re SE can be. seen as an equivalent to the Hannover Re Group. From an economic point of view, it is. equivalent to the group excluding minority interest.. The Solvency II ratio, as the of 2015, for the Hannover Re SE stood at 231% compared to. the 221% for the group. And this is unchanged from the figure we reported for the end of. the third quarter 2015.. So on this slide, you can see the different metrics we use to calculate the capital. adequacy of the group. Firstly, we – or first, we distinguish between the internal view. based on our full internal model, which is a framework for our actual risk management. within the group.. We also show such numbers on the basis of the Solvency II confidence level of 99.5%. And. the number below, they're having (26:11) solvency do consider two former Solvency II. requirements, and insofar, lead to the approved capital solvency ratio of 221%. On the. following slide, I will explain where the differences come from.. Here, beginning with our internal model at 99.97% Value at Risk, we start with a translation. to the 99.5% quantile as required by Solvency II, leading to a reduction in the capital. requirement of €4.6 billion. We have already discussed the next two steps last year. Firstly,. the haircut for minorities reduces the available capital due to the limited transferability of. the minority's interest under Solvency II rules. Secondly, the required capital increases due. to the calculation of the capital requirements for the operational risk according to the. standard formula as against our own internal approach to measure operational risk.. As you can see, each of the two effects accounts for roughly half of the difference. between the capital adequacy ratio derived from our full internal model relative to the. regulatory view.. The next slide should not be new to you, since we have merely adjusted it to the Solvency. II regulatory view as of December 2015. As one of the large global reinsurers, we do. benefit from a significant diversification between the different risk categories. The market. risk and the underwriting risk continue to be the main risk factors for Hannover Re.. On the next slide, we show the bridge from the IFRS shareholders' equity to the basic. own funds. The adjustments for assets under own management largely reflect the other. comprehensive income, the OCI. The adjustment for technical provision give rise to the. biggest difference between the accounting and the economic view. They mainly consist of. the effect from the discounting of technical provisions for P&C and reserve redundancies,. as well as the value in-force from our Life & Health business minus the risk margin.. We then have to consider deferred tax on these items. And in the next step, also deduct. foreseeable dividends, not only those paid to Hannover Re shareholders, but also, to the. minority shareholders of E+S Rück. Finally, we already discussed haircut on minorities has. to be deducted and all-in-all resulting in the unrestricted Tier 1 capital.. On top of this, we add our subordinated debt, the two-dated hybrids are classified as. Tier 2, the perpetual reissued in 2014 as restricted Tier 1 capital. As you can see and I've. pointed out this earlier, we have substantial headroom for further Tier 2 issuances under. Solvency II, leaving us with a high degree of flexibility to improve our overall capital. position or to act on upcoming business opportunities in the future. Overall, the. composition of our own funds as defined by Solvency II is of a very high quality with 87%. being unrestricted Tier 1.. As you know, we have stopped the full reporting on MCEV this year, because of the. reporting – because the reporting will be full substituted by the Solvency II for the three. reporting going forward. Therefore, we have also no longer applied the 4.5% cost of. capital as suggested by the CFO. But we have instead changed it to the 6% cost of capital. as required by the Solvency II calculations.. On this slide, you can see the development of the MCEV based on those metrics, also. with a view to providing a transition from one reporting basis to the other. Based on the. 4.5% cost of capital we have applied in the past, the MCEV is up by 3%, mainly driven. again by the very favorable development of the new business value in 2015 and reflecting. a further increase in the off balance sheet value that we carried.. Next slide. If we now go one step further in the reconciliation from MCEV methodology to. Solvency II, you can see that there is actually only rather small differences in the result. from the valuation of our life and health technical provision. This is also one reason why. we have discontinued with the MCV reporting and switch directly to Solvency II. The main. difference between two methodologies is based on minor differences in the capital. allocation and a few assumptions regarding the diversification.. Other differences are (32:00). And this should be – so our entry I'm sure there are also. into the Solvency II reporting. This concludes my remarks, and I'll leave the outlook to you,. Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. This slide really shows you the renewal at first week of April, with which. we are quite satisfied and if renewals for our traditional (32:33) reinsurance business from. Japan and also to some extent from Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and North America.. Despite the prevailing competitive market conditions, we managed to increase our. volume by 9%. And if you look at the sources of their increase, you can see that the price. and volume changes were rather minimal, which also shows you that the rating level. maintained quite well with the exception of some of the natural catastrophe business. where the rate reductions were in line with what we have seen at 1/1, but largely less. pronounced than a year ago. The growth came especially from the Asia-Pacific region.. And here, in particular, also, from Japan that we managed to grow our non-cap (33:50). business. Also, in North America, based on our very broad portfolio with more than 600. insurance companies we are doing business with, we were able to increase our business. from existing clients.. I would say that when you look into the new and cancelled and restructured business, new. business of €77 million, you can see that we have not written any very large new treaty. (34:33), but the growth is mainly the result of a number of new treaties from various. regions. We have, in particular, been – continue to be very cautious when it comes to. proportional treaties on U.S. excess and umbrella business, mainly because of our. experience from the last soft market where these treaties, which are very long tail in. nature, eventually resulted in some undesirable results.. We also had some growth on our credit and surety business, which again is with existing. large clients where there were some additional proportional reinsurance being purchased.. And with our market position, we were able to grow our shares there.. Also, our natural catastrophe business, we wrote some new business, which is a. diversifying business. And that actually resulted in – also an increase in our cat business,. but only very small increase.. I should probably mention, again, that we haven't changed our overall risk appetite for. cat, where our market share continues to be below our market share on the non-cat. business. We have continued to see significant pressure on aviation and also the marine. business. We managed to defend our good position on the marine excess of loss. business, where we could keep the volume at acceptable rate. This is not true on aviation. where we further reduced our volumes.. Lastly, also from proportional business, where the underlying rates at our view (36:45). rather low, and you have a better chance to lose money with those rates than make. money. And at the same time, our clients wanted to increase the commissions, we. actually reduced our involvement.. So if you look at the renewals so far here, we had 1.5% reduction in the first quarter and a. 9% increase in the smaller AAA for renewals. Overall, that means that our premium. volume on a currency-adjusted basis on the renewed season so far, on the traditional. property and casualty treaty business has been flat. And this is much in line with our. guidance for the entire year.. remember that when we reported on the full year results 2015, we changed the group. net income target from – in the region of €950 million to at least €950 million. And I think. the result of the first quarter fully supports this change.. As far as the dividend payout ratio goes, you can see here our strategic payout of 35% to. 40%, which allows us to self-finance our growth ambitions. However, with the current. situation being much like it were the last two years, if we are not seeing any new business. opportunities of a large scale, if we are not seeing the large losses being well above our. large loss budget, and if the capital markets behave, we would most likely again consider. an extraordinary dividend for 2016, even though I have to say it's early days, and a lot can. happen between now and year-end.. If you look at our non-life business, you can see that we continue to seek good. opportunities in North America. We already have seen that so far this year. And we also. believe that we will earn the cost of capital.. In Continental Europe, first quarter was pretty good. We saw increased volume at good. profitability. Overall for the year, we continue to believe a slight decrease in volume for. this business, particular outside (40:09) Germany is fairly competitive. But we still, with our. selective underwriting approach, would expect that we earn the cost of capital.. On the specialty line, overall declining premiums, because specialty lines are particularly. competitive on the marine side. We believe that we have rather high-quality (40:44). portfolio. Therefore, we believe that the profitability will be well above the cost of capital.. However, this profitability we will only achieve if we forego some of the premium volume.. Aviation, is a class I originally started my career. And it's fair to see that it's in a rather. dismal situation at this point in time. I won't spend much time on it. Credit and surety, we. now believe that maybe we even can see a slight increase in the volume and continued. profitability. And the same is true for the UK and Ireland where we particularly see some. growth in our rather modest primary insurance business. And on the facultative side, of. course, the one-off effect that we mentioned will not be there again this year. Therefore,. we see some reduced growth. But for the full year, we still believe that profitability will be. good.. On the global reinsurance overall, situation is reasonably favorable, particularly on the. worldwide treaty, where we see good development, particularly in Asia and Latin America.. There's good profitability. You can see here that on the property tax we say that we're. not earning the cost of capital fully. That's, of course, only the case if we have major. losses to the tune of the expected losses.. Of course, if we have situation like in the first quarter and the previous years, even at the. very slim rate that we are currently getting, we will see good profitability. However, at the. expense of significant volatility and therefore we curtail our exposure to property. catastrophe, structured reinsurance and ILS, that is where we have the Chinese (42:55). shares and therefore we expect reduced premium volumes there, but earnings and cost. of capital.. If I come to the life and health side, we continue to see good business opportunities on. our financial solution segment. And also, expect the profitability here to be very attractive.. Also, on the longevity business, we see further growth opportunities, despite the fact that. this business, particular on the pension blocks has become increasingly competitive.. transactions not to be renewed. However, I would say that this will mainly affect the. growth premium and to a much lesser extent the net premium, because we have. relatively high retrocession on these large transactions, which are subject to non-renewal.. When we look at the overall business, we believe that we will continue to see increased. underlying profitability, of course, in particular, on the, our U.S. mortality business due to. our measures to reduce collateral costs and even due to some successful initiatives to. increase rate on some underperforming YRT business.. I will then come to our rationale for the profit guidance for 2016 and beyond. We continue,. as we explained to believe that the underlying profitability of our Life & Health business is. increasing, of course, in 2015 due to the termination fee, with a little bit of spikes here.. But if you exclude that, the underlying increase in profitability should prevail.. On our P&C business, we entered 2016 on a very strong position with even increased. confidence levels of our loss reserves, which gives us very good and comfortable buffers,. so that we are quite confident that we will be able to keep the combined ratios below. 96%, maybe even quite a bit below 96% as long as the large losses stays in the large loss. budget. Also, on our retrocession side, we bought little bit more retrocession, but. conditions also have improved for us.. On the investment income, in absolute terms, again, outside one-off effects, we expect. rather stable development. I would say if you look at the last – at the five-year average. from the last year, in absolute terms, we should be able to continue at those levels. And. this is despite the continued low interest rate or in some cases, even a no interest rate. environment.. And on the admin expenses, it's (46:46) that we maintain our competitive advantage.. Indeed, in the first quarter in absolute terms, our admin expenses actually declined, but. we not necessarily think that this is a trend for the whole year.. With that, this ends the presentation we are giving you today. And, of course, we are now. more than happy to answer your questions.. Operator. Thank you. The first question is from In-Yong Hwang, Goldman Sachs. Hello. I'm In-Yong Hwang here from Goldman Sachs. I've got two questions. Firstly, on the. budget is still booked and full, and the one-offs doesn't seem to be anything special. percentage point, we are seeing quite strongly given the pricing pressure that's still going. into the market. So just a comment on how we should see this underlying combined ratio. improvement would be helpful?. And secondly on the April renewals, could you give us some idea what you're seeing on. pricing. I think one of the competitors today is saying that pricing decline is slowing down.. Obviously, it splits out of volume and the pricing development for your newer data. (48:07), but just some idea what you're seeing in the market would be helpful? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. I mean, if I come to the improvement in the combined ratio, I would say that we. continued to benefit from relative favorable development on the attritional losses. And I. mean, we've largely kept our policy to not release the unused budget profit, and that for. – I mean, if we keep the loss ratio (48:57) stable for the newest accident here and (49:04). are not happening, our IBNR reserve has actually increased in the first quarter quite. significantly.. I mean, you may be a little bit puzzled by the very low combined ratio of our Bermuda. subsidiary, but bear in mind that Bermuda largely writes property catastrophe business,. meaning, it's a very short-tail business. And, therefore, I mean, we tried to be very. conservative on (49:44) loss reserving. But of course, as it is a short-tail business, there. are always some relief (49:55) from previous years, because the limited time you can. keep those reserves.. We also had an extraordinary effect on Bermuda, because we had treaties that had been. the treaty has commuted and we had – I mean, we have no liability, and the loss hasn't. been recognized, because it was rather remote. And, therefore this is (50:32), of course,. immediately €10 million positive development in previous year loss ratio, which was. entirely unavoidable.. In-Yong Hwang. Okay.. Ulrich Wallin. If you then come to the pricing at April 1, mixed picture, I would say. I mean, still, on a nonproportional side, this is easier to comment on. We saw a slowing down in the declines,. but still, declines in most of the property catastrophe business. But overall, I would say,. the property catastrophe business is maybe down 4% to 5%.. On the non-cat business, situation was more stable. This also have to do with the fact that. there are risk losses in the market, and they have an effect on the business. So I mean as. shown in our slide, if you take it all together, I would say great quality decline is low-single. digit. So not dramatic.. If you look at the demand side for reinsurance the first quarter, quite a lot on the. proportionate side, where clients also from the U.S. were seeking pro rata cover. We are. happy to involved in that as long as there is reasonably short-tail business, meaning. property classes or claims made casualty classes.. As I already mentioned on the excess and umbrella business, where a lot of reinsurance is. being sought. We have been trying our ways overall (52:30).. In-Yong Hwang. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. The next question is from Xinmei Wang, Morgan Stanley.. Xinmei Wang. Hi. Good morning. I've got two questions. So the first is on the solvency ratio. Could you. give us an update on your conversations with the regulator? I know in the past you talked. about getting approval for the modeling of operational risk under the approved internal. model. So just an update on your conversations there.. And then, the second is on reserve development. Given some comments from your. peers over the last couple of weeks, I was wondering if you also had any impact from. premiums – reinstatement premiums or commissions given the low to benign (53:24) loss. environment of that being less than expected and whether that's affected your run-off. results in the quarter or in the last year. Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Well, I mean, if you look at the Solvency II internal partial model that's just excluding. operational risk, as far as model changes are concerned, that has been rather stable in. the first quarter. On the operational risk, we have projects to improve our operational risk. model to an extent that our regulators are able to approve that as well, and that is on a. good way. I mean, we expect at the latest in the first quarter 2017, at least that's the goal.. Of course, it depends on our regulator in the end. But that's a goal that at that time, we'll. also get our operational risk model – modified operational risk model being approved.. That should then hopefully also further improve the Solvency II ratios.. On the reserve development, I would say, I mean, 2015 reserve development was quite. positive, because the redundant reserves actually increased quite remarkably, and the. confidence level increased.. On the first quarter, uneventful, no particular changes there I would say. Of course, we are. not having done, I mean, first quarter full actuarial calculation here. As far as reinstatement. premiums are concerned, well, I would say, of course, due to the lack of natural. catastrophe losses, we haven't got any reinstatement premiums on the NatCat business.. On the risk business, I would say the risk losses are at or even slightly above the expected. levels, and therefore the reinstatement premiums there, at least on our books, are pretty. much in line with expectations. I mean, it's nothing extraordinary there.. Commissions. Of course, commissions increased on pro rata treaties as the results are. good, because you have to pay out profit commissions and, yes, it has an effect also on. our results. So the commission level is higher compensating in part for the low loss ratios.. But this is what you always have on pro rata business.. The profit and losses are not attributed on the metric basis, but rather there is a profit. commissions that is mitigating for the client. The effects are very good, you see that. Xinmei Wang. Okay. Thanks a lot.. Thank you. The next question is from William Hawkins, KBW.. William Hawkins. Hello. Thank you. The Hannover Re SE Solvency II ratio of 231%, could you tell me what the. numerator and denominator are for that ratio? Apologies if it's disclosed to someone.. And could you also tell me, would you apply the same 180% to 200% threshold range for. that entity or would it be different from the Group level?. And then secondly, on quarterly earnings, you made some comment about 2Q events,. but could you just be clearer, there've always been a number of headlines. Do you think. those – from your early plans, still are within the 2Q budget or would be enough to slip in. to the carried over first quarter P&L (57:46)? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Unfortunately, we haven't got those number on the SE Solvency II ratio. But I can tell you. that the difference is mainly the haircut which we haven't got on the SE. And otherwise, I. mean, the compile (58:04) the SE Solvency ratio based on so-called look-through. approach, which means that, therefore, it is very similar to the Group ratio and the. difference as I said is the haircut on the minorities.. William Hawkins. So, can I infer from that, that 180% to 200% is also a fair.... Ulrich Wallin. Yeah.. William Hawkins. ... target range? Right.. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. There's a target range that we have said (58:32) as well. (58:35) large losses in Q2.. I would say, from what I see now, of course, very early days, I mean, they could slip into. the carried over unused large loss budget. It's still early days. I mean, if I look at the. Japanese quake, early reports are more – are quite encouraging that the losses might not. be that large for our book. (59:07) on Ecuador that we have the largest market share of all. the reinsurers, which of course, means that we might have an over proportionally large. loss there. But, I mean, nothing too concerning. And as the McMurray fire, slightly different. Canada on the cat business like in all our cat business we're a little bit underway. However,. it's really early days there. I mean, today's report are a little bit more encouraging, but we. really have to wait there.. William Hawkins. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. The next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC.. Kamran Hossain. Hi. I've got – I guess, just one question from the life and health business. Clearly, that. financial solutions business is exceeding target enormously. So 18% EBIT margin versus. your expectation of your target of 3%. Can you talk a bit about why we're seeing such. fantastic margins in financial solutions?. And then the second part of the question is, overall in life and health, you're seeing. premium growth of pretty much flat. But obviously, that's somewhat down to reduced. longevity from the UK and from Australian product. Can you talk about kind of the. trajectory of kind of how much you're seeing financial solutions business grow? Any color. on that would be really helpful. Thank you.. Well, I mean, first of all, why do we have 2% target that we achieved the double-digit EBIT. margins? The 2% target is a little bit more from what we traditionally used to write in the. financial solutions business, which has been cash financing business. And on cash financing. business, of course, you financed through, I mean, commissions on quota share treaties. and in some cases, you have to write the fee – the seeding company has to seek quite a. lot of premiums in order to generate enough embedded value that the pre-financing is. being expected to be paid back to see necessary certainty.. In recent years, however, particular in the U.S., some of our business has changed from. cash financing basically to covering tail end exposures on largely mortality and to some. extent less exposures on policyholder behavior exposures.. These treaties are partly not booked as premiums under IFRS. And even if they are, the. premium is normally the same as the profitability because the loss expectancy to these. treaties on actual method is close to zero, but they are still capitalization efficient on a. statutory basis. That's the reason why the margins are so high then compared to the IFRS. premium.. When we look at the development of the IFRS premium, if that growth – I think it will grow. this year mainly because there are re-emergence of relatively attractive cash financing. opportunities, which will, of course, boost the premiums a bit, will also lower the EBIT. margin on an IFRS basis.. And your second question, you were wondering on the.... Kamran Hossain. It's just a different – the growth of the two businesses, so growth of financial solutions. business underlying because (01:03:28) all the moving parts.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I think – I mean, the business is still growing. You may not necessarily see that in the. premiums only if it's cash financing because some of them may be deposit accounted.. But I would say if you measure at a covered value enforced, you will probably see a pretty. good growth on that business. And the underlying profitability, more importantly, is. growing as well. So that business continues to be very favorable for us.. As far as the longevity business is concerned, yes, on the enhanced annuities in the UK,. for the reasons that have (1:04:09) we see a reduced premium volume and we also had, I. think, some last single premium treaties in China where we also see a reduced volume. after – I think if you exclude those, I think, the underlying growth is still there. You may not. see much of this, this year but I think if you look on a five-year time horizon, we will – I'm. very confident that we will achieve our growth objectives.. Kamran Hossain. Fantastic. Thanks very much. I appreciate the color. Thank you.. Operator. Thank you. The next question is from Frank Kopfinger, Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions on your Solvency II reporting. First of. all, could you walk us down from your 253% from last year to the 221% as of the end of. 2015? What were the drivers? Obviously, it's higher volumes but also, could you comment. on the diversification benefit that you're applying?. And secondly, could you provide some figures in respect to sensitivities? And especially. I'm looking for your credit spread sensitivity for Solvency II. I appreciate you have some. sensitivity for the P&L and the shareholders' equity, but as this is based on a relative basis,. it says it's 50%. Could you also provide some sensitivities with respect to absolute. numbers, so let's say, if credit spreads widens by 100 basis points.. Ulrich Wallin. I think Roland, if you want to take the second one.. Roland Vogel. Yes. I would do that.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes.. Roland Vogel. Should I start with it or.... Ulrich Wallin. Well, then I may give the reasoning from the 253%. Of course, it's the increased business. volume and on the reserves, of course, the increased volume of reserves had increased. the cap requirement. Also, we saw in that period a significant strengthening of the U.S.. dollar. And still, I mean, we are a little bit overweighed on our capital on euros that also. have an effect. It had mainly an effect in boosting the volumes that create the SCR in euro. terms. Those were the main drivers there. Diversification is slightly unchanged, I would. say, because the increases in the SCR drivers developed relatively homogenously.. Roland Vogel. Yeah, so, I will – I must admit I don't have an actual sensitivity based on an absolute basis. points increase or decrease in credit spends available. We may take that up. The question. here is, of course, if we would do that on a non-relative basis and you say, let's assume. 50 basis points or 100 basis points, so of course, for German bonds, 100 basis points will. be a very drastic increase.. And if you look at that (1:07:35), might not make that much sense. If you then look at 100. basis points on our high-yield portfolio that may be something which occurs a few times a. year. And in that regard, I'm a little bit skeptical with these absolute terms sensitivities.. Well, if you, for instance, look at the numbers we give you for the 50% range and I would. also say that this develops rather proportionally. So, if you then say, if a 100% increase in. credit spreads would, in rough terms, result in double the number of the sensitivity and. you apply that then to the approximately €5 billion in required capital, that then should. give you a little bit of an indication. Still, we feel very comfortable and even such a. sensitivity of potentially 100 basis points would not result in a sensitivity, which would. immediately give alter to our solvency ratio.. Frank Kopfinger. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. Thank you. The next question is from Michael Haid, Commerzbank.. Michael Haid. Morning. Two questions. So just one clarification. You've mentioned the reserving. movements that we have seen no particular effect in the first quarter. Does that mean. zero reserve releases or does it mean the expected level of reserve releases, something. like €50 million or so?. Second question, on the April renewals, can you give us an explanation why you were able. to increase the volume to such an extent in a very competitive environment? Is it because. the underlying market growth or do you have better access to the market, i.e., is it. Hannover Re specific, or why does this business show up in the reinsurance market?. Ulrich Wallin. Would you take the first one, Roland?. Roland Vogel. Yes, of course. So I think if we say there were no extraordinary developments to our loss. reserves that means that we have the normal run rate, so it should be around the positive. effect of the number which I have mentioned.. Michael Haid. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. If I then come to the why we could increase on April 1. I think overall, we have seen a slight. increase in demand for reinsurance at the April 1 renewal, particular also from proportional. treaties. I don't think that this growth of the business is evenly spread among the. reinsurers. It appears that the larger reinsurers benefit from that a little bit more maybe. than the smaller reinsurers.. For us, I mean, we had quite good opportunities to grow the business at 1/4, actually to a. larger extent than we actually did because we recognize that the market is still soft and. reinsurance pricing overall is certainly a lot lower than it was like three years ago. And,. therefore, I mean, we have to be very careful because some of that additional. reinsurance buying might also be a little bit defensive.. So, from that point of view, we looked at a broad-based growth rather than very. concentrated growth out of that, and we were able to achieve that. I think it's also fair to. say that the overall volume renewed at 1/4, of course, is significantly less than what you. see at 1/1.. Michael Haid. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. The final question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. Hi there. Morning. So most of my questions have been addressed. Thank you. But just. one, if I can ask. In the MtCR on the European side, there is a rather low or a nice 88.9%.. And I'm just wondering because one of the larger peers have mentioned German motor. needed some longevity adjustment in their case. Have you noticed anything that should. be highlighted here from (01:12:42) perspective below 90%. This level usually indicates a. good level, but I'm just curious. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. You don't think about the 88.9% (01:13:00) on Continental Europe. Well, I mean, this. is certainly not for the German motor business where it's close to 100%. I mean, this. refers to a large extent to the motor access of loss business that we have in that class. because that is a very lucrative business. It is quite heavily exposed to volatility. And there,. really the MtCR has dropped very significantly this year, decreasing interest rates because. the value of money is coming down so much. And the other is, of course, on the pro rata. and (01:13:55) business that is quite a bit of natural catastrophe exposure within that book.. And this is the reason why we see this little bit surprisingly low MtCR.. Operator. Thank you. We currently have no further questions.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. If there are no further questions, I would then thank you very much for listening, and. thanks for your questions.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending. This call has been included. You may now. disconnect.",20160510_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2016-5-10_FS000000002275763746.pdf,2016-05-10
29,"Good morning, to all of you. Welcome to Hannover Re's Investors' Day 2016. My name is. Karl Steinle. And I'm really delighted that so many of you were able to take up our. invitation for our 19th edition of this event.. Since we are keeping the annual rotating schedule of this event, it's my pleasure to see. you all here in London today. I was also very pleased that so many of you managed to. attend yesterday's dinner at the Museum of London Docklands. Purely by coincidence, of. course, there was a certain connection to our own business. Last year, our focus was in. motor business. Some of you, doubtless, still remember those wonderful classic cars.. This year we put the emphasis and the spotlight on marine. Yesterday evening was truly. unforgettable and a great atmosphere in a marvelous location. Once again, it was. Kathleen who devoted so much energy and care in putting everything together.. Despite being sick at home, I know she is with us today via webcast. So Kathleen, many. thanks and get well soon.. I hope you enjoyed the dinner as well and were able to engage in some stimulating and. inspiring conversation. If so, we have already achieved one of our major goals of this. Investors' Day, namely, promoting the dialogue between you and management. In stark. contrast to last night's program, there is no policeman, no pub lady or drunken sailor to. deliver a performance today. Nevertheless, the program that we have assembled is no. less attractive. In doing so, we have been guided by your comments and feedback from. past Investors' Day, analyst conferences and by the questions that you have raised. throughout the year.. With this in mind, I would like to draw your attention to the feedback questionnaire on. your table. It takes just a couple of minutes to increase your ROI, your return on Investors'. Day, for next year. I really cannot emphasize enough how highly we value your feedback. and appreciate your remarks. Feel free either to leave the feedback form on the table or. hand it over to Julia and her team.. I would like to just make a few organizational remarks. Please note that we are webcasting. all the presentations and the Q&A today. Some colleagues have already logged in to. follow the day's events online. And for the convenience of all, the stream will be available. on the Hannover Re's website so that you can review it in the future.. With this mind, during the Q&A session, please wait for the microphone before asking. questions. During the breaks, feel free to use the entire space outside of this room. We. have also free WiFi for you. The access key is on your desk.. What you will also find on your desk is a small gift. I do hope it will be useful for you. But. please do not underestimate the high-tech manipulation that we have put into it. Although. it looks entirely normal, we have, in fact, programmed it to write only positive notes about. Hannover Re and buy recommendations, of course. Please consider this as a token of our. appreciation for your participation today and the support that you have shown to. Hannover Re and to our investor relations team.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to our CEO, Ulrich Wallin.. Ulrich, the floor is yours.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, Karl.. I'm going to time it today. So I brought my HandyCall; mobile, as you say in English. Yes.. Good morning. Welcome to our Investor Day 2016. I will tell you a little bit about our. strategic position and what I think everybody regards as a competitive business being the. reinsurance business that has been well-commented about.. As I already alluded to yesterday, 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of Hannover Re.. Therefore, we put a 50 on all our slides these days. We will not put a 51 next year, I can. tell you that. For the time being, we have as the 50. And therefore, I would start my. presentation with some remarks on the development of Hannover Re during the first 50. years. And this is, of course, a little bit of history. But it's also relevant for our current. positioning because being a reinsurer in business for 50 years, I think it's fair to say that. we stood the test of time.. And so, our clients regard us as one of the established larger reinsurers. And this position. is actually quite helpful in order to be a preferred partner. Thus, if you remember, we had. the casualty crisis in the mid 1980s, which a number of reinsurers fell by the wayside. We. were still relatively small at that time. But we managed to come through. And I think,. therefore, the first time Hannover Re was able to benefit from a hardening market in a. fairly big way, because we increased our US casualty business in 1986 by four times.. And this is a little bit internally, I would say, selection of cycle management. And since. then, we believe in cycle management as an important tool to be successful in the. reinsurance side. Of course, other major events were of course 9/11, which was initially -of course, it was a human tragedy. But from a reinsurance point of view, initially it was a. huge loss. It was coinciding with some negative reserve development of the market in. and large. And also to some extent at Hannover Re. But again, we came through to that. relatively well. Then I will not dwell on the more recent events.. So if you can see, Hannover Re started from rather humble beginnings as an in-house. reinsurer of; a German mutual insurance company. And initially, the first CEO, Claus. Bingemer, he is still alive, actually; when he wanted to have a whole town hall company. staff meeting he only needed to meet his accountants and all the other personnel of. Hannover Re met.. That over time changed. Today, we employ more than 2,500 people. 50%, half of them,. actually in our location in our home office in Hannover and the other half around the world.. What may be remarkable for Hannover Re in 1994, Hannover Re had its IPO. and since. then we are publicly traded. And you can see that the development since then has been. quite remarkable. Premium income continues to grow. And so it is a growing company. from all accounts.. Coming to the next slide; this is just the development over the last 50 years of the mix, of. geographical mix, of our business. And you can see that we were growing since 2009. quite substantially again. And you will also see that a particular growth driver has been the. emerging markets. And here, very remarkably, Asia. So you can see that one of the. growth engines of the reinsurance business have actually been the growing insurance. market, in particular Asia and also Latin America. And towards a lesser extent, Africa.. Africa may be the next emerging market from an insurance point of view.. You can also see that our German domestic business is very important. But is less than. 10% of our overall volume. And that is despite the fact that on the P&C side, we are the. market leader in Germany. So you can -- that would mean, being a local German reinsurer. like we started on, you would never be able to be among the major reinsurers.. What we also managed over the years, to accumulate assets. And that, of course, this. shows the development of our assets under management and we also had some assets. prior to 1980. But of course, the scale doesn't show them very well. If you would have had. the same graph in 1980, you would still have relatively long bars. But we have gone on; we. are 2016 now.. Accumulation of assets is not the only parameter of success. But it is an important one. because it shows the increasing financial strength of the company. And of course, it's also. the base of our investment income and the growth of our capital.. So summing up the current success factors of Hannover Re. We are having two business. groups. P&C and Life & Health, which gives us a good diversification, because they have a. different risk profile, while as the P&C is driven by the new and renewal business. And so,. therefore show some volatility in the results, depending on the -- on the market. conditions as they prevail. On the other hand, Life & Health is driven by the in-force. business and as such is less -- the results are less reliant on the current development of. the business because the in-force written in previous years is dominating the results.. Active cycle management, I told you a little bit about that. It was mid '80s was the US. casualty crisis. We continue with that. And we have been relatively successful also in. general soft markets finding pockets of hard market like in 2009, the credit and surety. business, more lately with the development of PPO's, UK motor insurance on an excess. of loss basis or the Australian group business in 2013.. Risk management, our formal risk management department we introduced in 2006, we. had risk management before that. But with our 2005 hurricane losses, we felt we should. take it a little bit more serious. Meanwhile, we have our internal model being approved by. our regulator. So we have gone quite a long way there. Financial strength, we were the. first reinsurer in Europe to get an S&P rating.. At that point in time, S&P was so excited about the whole thing that they gave us an AAA. rating based on very little capital. And some of our competitors were not very happy with. it. But first at that the time it was very important and we never fell below AA; where we. currently are as well.. Well the other thing at Hannover Re we always price ourselves to have the lowest. expense ratio in the industry, that continues to be true. It's the competitive advantage we. feel. And we have been pioneering new business. We were the first company using the. capital market to place insurance risks. And there are many other examples, which I won't. mention now that would underline that.. So having been 50 years in the reinsurance market, the question, of course, is reinsurance. the right business to be in? Is it an attractive business or not? Because at least as long as. I'm in the reinsurance business, it was always said that the reinsurance market gradually. will demise due to higher retentions of the primary insurance companies which get ever. more financially strong. And therefore there will be less reinsurance being needed over. time.. We don't believe that's the case. And now, they're trying to demonstrate it in this section. of my presentation, we believe that reinsurance is and will continue an attractive business.. If you look at the P&C market, you can see first of all that the market has been growing,. particular in this timeframe from 2010 to 2012 and to some extent 2013 where the market. conditions on the P&C side were quite favorable. And you can see that in the growth of. the business. From 2012 onwards, it has been a little bit more flattish. And the reason for. that is pretty much the soft market that we have since.. The increase that you see here in 2015 has largely to do that we show this chart in our. balance sheet currency euro. And of course, increase in 2015 to a large extent is driven by. exchange rates. But you also can see that the larger reinsurers grow faster than the. smaller reinsurers. So while the market overall grew a little bit more than 3%, the top 10. reinsurers grew by 6.1%.. So there is a little bit of a flight to the larger insurers emerging. And as we as Hannover Re. grew even a little bit more during the timeframe being 8.1%, that also meant that we able. to increase our market share from 4% to 5% . And we believe that in the long run, we. should be able to continue to grow our market shares based on growth when market. conditions are more favorable.. And the reason for that is that the market is extremely fragmented. So you can see that. there are quite a lot of players. And it's a little bit of mergers and acquisition activity. But at. the same time as the entrance hurdle into the P&C reinsurance is not very high, there are. also new reinsurers being set up almost on a monthly basis. Part of them, of course, the. ILS backed investment funds. So we feel that there is plenty of room for us to gain market. share from the many small to medium-sized players as we have done in the past.. If I then come to the Life & Health reinsurance business, it is a different picture. But it's. growing as well. Now, you can also see that the market is significantly smaller than the. P&C market. But it's growing here, of course, again, 2015 is largely driven by currencies. because the global premium income on the Life & Health business is driven by US dollardenominated business, particularly from the US, which makes up for more than half of the. Life & Health reinsurance business.. But you can also see that the market is very, very concentrated. And the top players being. the top 10 basically control the entire market. And you could even say the top seven have. the majority of the market. So it is a very concentrated market. So growing by acquisition. in this market is becoming increasingly difficult. And it's also contrary to the P&C market, if. you want to gain market share, you can only take it from the established large. competitors.. At the same time, it's the market where the hurdle to entrance is a lot higher than P&C.. So we are not seeing a lot of new reinsurers coming to market that are actually successful.. So it is a little bit a closed shop.. And the reason for that is that for new a reinsurer in the Life & Health business, he would. have no in-force business. Of course, you can buy in-force business through a transaction.. But that normally shows significantly smaller margins than if you write new business.. On the new business, however, in order to get a meaningful portfolio together, it will take. you like 5 to 10 years and most investors haven't got that patience, therefore we haven't. seen new entrants in this market in the last 10 years to speak of. Quite to the contrary, we. have seen quite a lot of M&A activity.. The competition in Life & Health in the reinsurance side is mostly surrounding solutions. that we can bring to our clients. And we compete with our competitors, who is able to. have the better solution for the client because that will win us the business.. It's closer relationship with the insurance industry, the clients, it is mostly traded on a direct. basis rather than through brokers. And in addition there is more of services that we. provide our client with to help them in their distribution and underwriting.. But it is still an attractive market to be in if you are one of the established reinsurers. because then you have the benefit of the in-force and that is really what, we are one of. those reinsurers. So it is a strong position for us to be in.. Then, of course, the next question is, will there be a continued need for reinsurance, or. would the value-added that the reinsurance product provides actually vanish. I don't. believe that this is the case. And I think there are some underlying drivers of the insurance. business that will continue to create reinsurance demand and maybe even increased. reinsurance demand. First of all, we have the trends to value concentration, the protection. gap as well as the demographic aging of the population.. And all these trends have one thing in common, that they have no diversification within. themselves because even the protection gap, if you go to the P&C side, is mostly. property catastrophe driven like as the value concentration and also the demographic. development is going into the same direction. Therefore, individually on these trends,. they are not providing the inherent principle of insurance of the law of large numbers. So. they lead to concentrated exposures within the insurance companies and therefore the. need to manage those.. And for that, the reinsurance market provides very valuable service because the. reinsurance business is a global business. And so, we, as the reinsurer, are able to provide. for the exposures from these trends the global diversification that the reinsurance can do,. therefore, reinsurers can provide value added here. And that means that the trends are. actually playing in the hands of the reinsurance market.. The next thing is new products, like cyber digitalization and emerging risks. Of, course,. these products are largely pioneered by the direct insurers first and foremost. But. reinsurers with their global relationships and their global reach can provide insight and. assistance for the insurance industry in that respect.. And the other important subject here is that on the new risk, of course, quantifying the. exposure is always difficult. And, therefore, if you reinsure that risk, it helps you to have a. more stable run-up of the business and, therefore, again, the reinsurance can add value. here. And again, it can do that mainly on the basis of the global diversification which is,. again, as a basis for reinsurance.. Then third, we have, of course, capital requirements, capital management and. management of volatility of earnings, very traditional reasons to buy reinsurance. And they. continue to prevail, in particular when it comes to capital management with the new. capital models that are used like Solvency II, that's a risk-based or the BCAR ratio in the. US, all of that actually creates opportunities for reinsurance, because we can help our. clients to optimize their capital structures and, therefore, write more profits on the same. capital. So use their capital much more efficient and the reason is that when we take. concentrated risk from our clients, we reduce their cost of capital. And if we take the risk,. the cost capital that it creates for us is less than the cost of capital that we alleviate our. client from and this is because we have a different mix of business.. And lastly. But probably the most prominent reason to buy reinsurance, is to manage the. volatility of earnings, in particular for companies that are publicly quoted, volatile earnings. are not good because it's not good for the share price if you have highly volatile earnings.. And of course, reinsurance gives you a much more stable earnings stream. As you can. see on the next slide that just demonstrates kind of the reinsurance protection on an. aggregate basis where you can see that it really smoothens out the earnings so that the. ceeding company can report a rather smooth development of its earnings, which is. actually quite helpful.. So what that all means, that we believe that reinsurance creates value for the insurance. companies and we will, of course, only be able to sustainably sell reinsurance if we create. value with our clients or if it's value adding to our client, or at least that it provides a. perceived value added. Of course, the former is better than the latter. And I think the -which I demonstrated that's actually the case.. So moving on to the question, will the market always be soft like it currently is or can we. expect to see better market conditions in future and this is particular, of course, geared to. the P&C, it's not driven so much to the Life & Health business.. What you can see here on the light blue line is the average return on equity of the 10. largest insurance companies that drive at least 50% of their premiums in reinsurance ion. those years which are depicted here. So you can see that the ROE of the reinsurance. market has been quite volatile, right? We had 2005 due to the hurricanes where the ROE. was very low, then it increased enormously only to come back down with the financial. crisis, going back up again and then being down again in 2011.. Since 2012, you can see no volatility. You can see a gradual slide of the ROE. And that has. more to do with the increased capital of the market than with the reduced earnings. But. you can also see on the dark blue line which is the Guy Carpenter rate on line index for. property catastrophe business as a proxy for the market.. So you can see that each time that the ROE of the market dropped below 5%, they was a. reaction of the market. And the reaction that you can see that, of course, after the. hurricanes in 2005, of course, this is cap business, the reaction is rather drastic. If you. would have the overall market, it would have been less drastic but you would have the. same reaction also on other lines of business.. And even the financial crisis which did not result in any underwriting losses, it still resulted. in negative earnings quality of the reinsurance market and it responded with a rather. broad-based hardening in 2009. And of course, 2009 results were, again, pretty good. So. it started to slide again until the earthquakes in Asia and the Thai floods in 2011. And. again, you could see the reaction of the market.. And we believe that if we have a similar situation for whatever reasons that the average. ROE of the market falls below acceptable levels, that will, again spur a reaction in the. market and a positive reaction. And why do we believe that? We believe that because in. reinsurance it's actually quite a rational competition that we have, because almost all of. the major participants in that market are publicly quoted. And so, they need to make. money.. The same is true for the ILS market that has come into our market that's basically. investment firms that need to make money for their clients so for their investors as well.. And that, of course, means that if your earnings drop below an acceptable level, you. need to do something about it as the management of the insurer because you're publicly. quoted. And if you are not doing, you will have another management trying instead of. you. And therefore in that case then we have to look at your business, what did hurt you,. where you see opportunities. But you will have a more risk averse posture at that time. and that will create a hardening of the market.. I must admit we quite like hardenings like we have seen in 2009 and 2012 because they. provide us with good profitability opportunities but there is no dislocation, therefore,. those kinds of hardenings are not driving business out of the market into retention. We. have seen that in the more drastic situations like the mid '80s on the US casualty business. where the market fiercely reacted and drove a lot of business into retention and we have. seen a little bit of that following the World Trade Center disaster in 2001, which also was. more a dislocated market.. So of course, you never get what you want. But definitely hardening markets without this. dislocation are certainly the best thing for the industry, therefore, the reinsurance industry. did quite well I would say since 2002 because, yes, we had volatility. But the volatility led. to on average pretty good pricing in the reinsurance market without resulting in. dislocations.. So now hopefully having established that the reinsurance business continues to be. attractive albeit very competitive, the question, how can we position or how we believe. that we have positioned Hannover Re that we should be able to continue to outperform. the market.. First of all, a cornerstone of our business model is that we have two business groups. And. those business groups are diversifying well. And, again, the main reason for this rather. good diversification is also that one of the business is renewal-driven and the other is. more driven by the in-force.. As such, I would say between life reinsurance which is largely biometric and not. investment risk. So it also diversifies to the asset side of the balance sheet because it's. biometric risk-driven and not investment-driven and P&C, we get a better diversification. than you would have between P&C reinsurance and P&C primary insurance, in particular if. your P&C primary insurance is large commercial and specialty lines because there the. cycles follow each quite closely I would say.. So we have a good diversification from that point of view. And that helps us to write a. larger profit stream on our capital base than we would have been able to do if we would. only be monoline with one or the other and that, of course, you can see that I guess in. somewhat more attractive ROEs. I have, of course, to accept that our large peers like. Munich Re, Swiss Re, SCOR they have a similar advantage because they, too, have life. and non-life business.. If I then come to another important part of our business, as you can see in the first part of. this slide, we have a rather positive cash flow. You can see this on the light blue line. And. our cash flow is also a little bit more positive as a percentage of premium income than our. competitors.. And we feel that this improves our market condition quite significantly. And it also gives. you a hint that the underlying result, in particular on the P&C business that we are able to. produce, is a little bit better than the result that we actually show in our profit and loss. account because the cash flow from operations has always been significantly in excess of. the EBIT of the company.. So from that point of view on an otherwise relatively stable book of business, I think it. shows you that the underlying quality of the business is pretty good. Of course, this. positive cash flow also helps the buildup of the assets under management. Of, course,. there are other influences on the assets under management like interest rates and credit. spread shifts that have an influence on the valuation which, of course, has nothing to do. with the cash flow.. You also have acquisitions where you buy basically a company with a lot of assets and that. is also, of course, non-organic and has nothing to do with the underlying cash flow of your. business. And also how much capital you repatriate to your shareholders also, of course,. reduces your assets under management. But you can see that at Hannover Re we are. this timeframe and, of course, that is a basis for increased investment returns even in a. low-yield environment or reducing yield environment.. Then, of course, the next question is, with a low yield environment, of course, we have. the opportunity to create investment income quite easily by just selling some of the. bonds that have appreciated due to the low interest rates and hence, we create profits.. However, if it's on the bond business, you create profits, if you take profits that otherwise. you would have in future years, you bring that forward.. So if you do a lot of that, it should basically reduce your ability to show attractive returns in. future. And you can see of the larger reinsurers we have all done that because we've. continued to be in an environment of reducing interest rates rather than low interest. rates, even though at times we couldn't believe that interest rates can even drop further.. But reality told us they can.. But you can see in comparison to our peers, we have done less than them and that we. feel gives us also -- holds us in a good competitive positioning. And the result of all of this. is that we are able actually to keep our ROI in absolute terms at quite stable and also. comparatively are able to continue to benefit from our increasing assets under. management. So that's one of the -- which we feel well-positioning of Hannover Re in. relation to the peers and, of course, relation to the peers in a competitive business is. always very, very important.. The other thing is where we think we are strongly positioned is on our loss reserves. And. of course, I'm stealing a little bit of Andreas' thunder here because I give you the. numbers already early on. But what I basically want to show that the fact that we had a. positive development of the run-off of our loss reserves does not mean that we have. released loss reserves to the detriment of the quality of the overall loss reserves. Quite. on the contrary, you can see that the redundancy being the difference between to tell us. what's according to our best estimate and our actual reserves, that has actually increased. consistently and in particular you saw a sharp increase in 2015.. And if you look at the graph on the lower right side, we had the highest growth of the. redundant loss reserves when we had also the highest positive run-off results from our. previous loss reserves. And the reason for that is that with our initial loss reserves for the. new underwriting years, we apparently are very conservative because we reserve our. new business, the newest underwriting years to a combined ratio close to 100. And that is. the reason why we see this positive development of the loss reserves. It's not the reason. that we actively released loss reserves in order to create profitability, quite to the. contrary.. If you go to the individual years, the chart on the upper right side shows you the. underwriting year development of the loss reserves from 2009 to 2015. And you can see. that even in the older years, we still see a positive development of our loss reserves,. that's more from the long-tail lines, of course. The early years that you see a positive. development, that is, of course, the short-tail lines really, therefore the 30 up to 36. months, a lot of these short-tail loss reserves have to be released and, therefore, 2012. has shown such a high reserve release in this timeframe.. You can also see the here were some negative developments like 2010 as the. development has been a lot less positive. That's due to the fact that the 2010 New. there we had actually negative development of our loss reserves but still overall it was. positive.. So again, what this slide should tell you, if you see a positive development on our loss. reserves that does not meant that the redundancies are being taken down, quite to the. contrary. So it would not be right to say, okay, fine, there was a 6% release of loss. reserves, the combined ratio was 95. So the corrected combined ratio would be 101.. That's actually not quite the case as you can see with the development of the. redundancies.. Again, as the expenses, as you can see our expense ratio has come down on the admin. expense ratio. The overall expense ratio including the brokerages and commissions have. actually slightly increased. We're still a bit below the market average on that front as well.. But for us, the reason for the increase is a shift in the portfolio which is following the. demand of our clients.. We have seen a larger portion of our business being proportional reinsurance and, of. course, on proportional reinsurance you pay higher commissions than you pay on nonproportional reinsurance. That's the reason for that increase. But overall, we continue and. we will do everything to defend that competitive advantage, we continue to see. attractively low expenses, both admin expenses as well as total expenses.. So we feel that we have a clear competitive advantage here. And all that results in. significantly more positive ROEs than our peers show here, you have seen that at the. beginning of the graph this is the average ROE of the peer group, the 10 largest. reinsurers compared with the ROEs that we were able to achieve. And we were quite. happy this development and, of course, we are striving to keep the difference to the. extent we can.. So now that I have tried to demonstrate that reinsurance is an attractive business and we. are well-positioned in it, now, I'll try to also to tell you that like in the past where we were. able to increase our earnings, we believe that we can continue with that trend into the. future. So we believe that also in the medium and long term, we will be in the position to. Let's look at the P&C business first. Yes. We are having a soft market and, of course,. whilst we have been able up to now to grow the earnings in the soft market as well, that,. which is only just maybe finding the bottom. But it will probably continue to be a more a. But we believe in particular due to our very conservative position on our loss reserves that. see in the immediate future a drop in the underwriting profitability of our business and I. think what we have seen in the first six months of this year have borne that out.. So from that point of view in the soft market we believe that we are able to keep the. profitability of our business constant. And like we have shown in the past, when the. market changes and I think as I have demonstrated, it's not if the market changes, more. like when the market changes, we believe that we can grow our market share again and. that we will also see increased earnings again.. Second, on the Life & Health business, we have an underlying trend of growing. profitability from our Life & Health business. And one of the aspects is that we have an. extremely positive value of new business in recent years, significantly almost EUR2 billion. of value of new business since 2011 and that's gradually and I hasten to emphasize,. gradually, filter through into IFRS earnings.. So the underlying trend is positive. We have continued to have problems with our ING. block that we bought from Scottish Re in 2008. That masks this development to some. extent in the immediate future but with the underlying trend of growing our earnings, this. doesn't mean that our earnings reduce on a normalized level taking out one-off effects.. So in the immediate future we would see our EBIT of Life & Health to be around EUR300. million to EUR350 million and then it will increase once we have soft and we are in the. process of solving the problem is our ING portfolio, also with growing what we call the. organic mortality business which is a business that we write new based on the platform. we bought from Scottish Re since 2009.. about EUR300 million annual premium on that with a double digit EBIT margin and that will. grow in the next three years to about EUR500 million. So you can see it is growing quite. nicely.. And lastly on the investment returns, we believe that we could safeguard in the short,. medium and long term, kind of stable, absolute returns on our investments, even. assuming that the low interest rate environment is here to stay for a while. And that if you. put it all together, we think in the short term we will be able to defend the current. earnings power which we see around EUR1 billion after tax. And that in the medium and. long term we will be able to move forward from that.. This shows you the development of our capital and the development of our earnings. And. you can see that from 2011 onward, the average capital increased every year. But the. earnings, after-tax earnings increased every year as well. So the ROE we were able to. keep quite constant. Of course, if I just take the actual number from 2011, the earnings. have grown a little bit faster than the capital. However, 2011, of course, was a year where. we had very high major losses. So we did not reach our planned result. If I adjust it and put. the planned result of EUR650 million in 2011 then the earnings and the capital grew in. tandem.. So that has been a very good development, in the immediate future for the reasons I just. mentioned on the previous slide, that will be more difficult to come by but we still believe. that we can keep the ROE well above our minimum requirement of 900 basis points in. excess of risk-free, therefore we see no reason to lower this target. So we keep it stable. we increased it like two years ago, with the earnings power of our business and the. expected development of the capital, there's no reason to believe that we should see a. negative development here.. That, of course, leads to the question of capital management. Capital management for. Hannover Re so far has been paying extra dividends. And that will continue to be the case.. So the basic parameters that as long as the earnings goes sideways, we will pay extra. dividend to keep the growth of the capital in line and, therefore, to defend the ROE to. the extent we can. If we are able to grow the earnings again, of course, we would stop to. pay extra dividends. But then, of course, the regular dividend should gradually increase. with the increase of the underlying earnings power.. There are a few other considerations that we have to take into account here, with our. 35% to 40% threshold of the IFRS earnings, that continues to determine our regular. dividend and that will continue to be the case. We also have, of course, your return on. equity which means that we have to balance and have to keep the increase of capital. somehow in check. We will not decrease our capital. We don't think there's any need for. that.. Then we have the capitalization. Of course, we can only reduce the growth of our capital if. we are not running into problems with our capital ratios, in particular also with the rating. agencies but as Andreas will present to you, we are at good state there.. And lastly, we also want to have a consistent dividend payout rather than a volatile. dividend payout where there are years where we pay low dividend, therefore we have to. keep some of our powder dry, that goes to the detriment of the dividend in a given year. for the benefit of the consistency of the dividend because you also want to be in the. position to pay an attractive dividend even if you have a year, say, like 2005 when due to. major catastrophes, the overall earnings are not allowing us on a standalone basis to pay. such a dividend. Therefore, we have to keep some of our powder dry. And that's what we. are doing.. So summing it up, as a top tier reinsurer we are well-positioned in what we feel in an. attractive market and whilst reinsurance is a competitive business, it's rational-competitive. and market-driven competitive, earnings-driven competition which we feel is good and. therefore we feel that we will be able to grow our earnings in the medium and long term.. That concludes my presentation. Thank you very much for listening. Of course, I'm more. than happy to answer your questions and I will join Karl for that.. Questions And Answers. Karl Steinle. Okay. Well thank you very much.. For the Q&A session, I like to remind you to wait for the microphone before asking a. question. I already see the first question at Kamran and we follow by Vinit.. Good morning. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. A couple of questions and one of the two. might actually be for a little bit later on this morning. But the first one is just about the; I. reinsurance. Given where interest rates were I guess the last few times we've seen the. market turn, do you think we're going to have to see the top 10 reinsurers produce an. absolute loss for a year to change the markets? That's the first question.. And the second question is on the loss reserves, I know we're going to cover this later on.. What do you think the optimal range is above actuarial best estimate? So clearly you're. over 8% right now. But I imagine that 0% above actuarial best estimate isn't your optimal. range. So if you could give some color around that, that'd be really helpful. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. On the first question, what the ROE will do when the market is changing, I think we will. see an increased ROE. We may not see 20% again and the reason for that is that the. capital base of the industry is a lot higher than it was in previous hard cycles. And also I. guess the reinsurance market is less leveraged than it was in previous cycles.. But I think that the ROEs will, of course, increase. And what will change the market to. where do the ROEs need to drop. I think as they drop below 5%, that should be sufficient. to change the market. A lot will depend on; for the development of the market is, of. course, major events will have an effect like they had in the past. But also the quality of. reserving will have an effect because you obviously have the highest effect if you have. major, major loss. And at the same time, you realize that your reserves are deficient. And. the combination of the two that we had seen in 2001 normally makes a hard market.. And of course, the longer the market stays soft, you would see that the overall sufficiency. in the loss reserve in the market will drop because there's pressure on the marketplace to. report acceptable results. And if rates are low and acceptable results are not. automatically following from the underlying business, of course you resort to loss. reserves. That has been the case in the past and that probably still will be the case. So if. with combination of those, you see the ROEs drop below 5%, I think you will see a. reaction in the market. Of course, the longer the market remains soft the more drastic the. reaction will be.. And the second, what is the optimal loss reserves that we want to have, the optimal. sufficiency. Of course, I would say we do not want to go negative. But I would say we. always want to have some buffers in our loss reserves. We also have that in our limit and. threshold system, we have a threshold of I think it's 2% or 3%. Yes. It's 2.5%. So the. threshold is 2.5%. So if our loss reserve redundancy falls below 2.5% of the loss reserves,. we enter the end of that territory in our limit and threshold system. So that's basically the. answer to that.. Vinit Malhotra. Yes. Good morning. Vinit Malhotra. So Ulrich, thanks for the clarity around the ordinary. payouts and how you think of the dividends in a flat earnings, et cetera. And do you think. of the total payout growth as a variable as well also given the context that the Hannover. Re share price total yield is a little below their peer. So the growth should be faster? Do. you actually think about the growth aspect as well? So that's my key question on the. capital.. I do have questions on the life comment. I can put the question of life and like the answer. later in the presentation. But in the life you seem to indicate the EUR300 to EUR350. It. seems to suggest that this was sort of the annualized of the Second Quarter level. I knew. it was meant to continue one or two quarters. But if you're suggesting it's meant to. continue one or two years, then is there something new that has happened in the last few. months that has changed your mind on this a little bit? Or maybe just a clarification would. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, on the growth of the dividend, I think we have seen some growth in the dividend.. Even with our extra dividends in '14 and '15, we have grown that a little bit. I would say. based on the current situation, the current dividend of EUR 4.75 is quite an acceptable. dividend. And it's a little bit too early because there are almost two and a half months to. go to talk about that.. But the regular dividend, that we have an aim to grow that with the growing profitability as. I expected. In the short term, it really depends a little bit on the opportunities that we. have to grow the business in the short term. And it's not impossible that that will happen,. of course. And we need more capital and so the extra dividend may continue to stay.. Whereas if there's really nothing changing and the business is gradually reducing a little. bit including the exposure with the soft market, of course, a little bit more drastic. reduction of the growth of the capital base could lead to an increased dividend.. But we have no particular growth target for our dividend. It's not that we say we want to. grow the dividend for, say, 5% or 10% every year. We have a growth target for the profit. and we feel that the growth targets for the profit there should also be a growing. dividend. But we are not saying that would have to be every year. I would say if you look at. the five-year timeframe we, of course, expect our dividend to increase in the five-year. timeframe but not every year.. Unidentified Participant. The life?. Ulrich Wallin. Oh, on the life, yes. Well on the Life & Health business we have seen that the negative. development on the ING portfolio has been a little bit more pronounced than I would say. we have thought a year ago and we continue to work on that. But it seems to take us little. bit longer than we have expected, therefore it subdues the earnings for longer than we. would have liked. But I guess when Klaus gives his presentation, he can give you a little bit. more color on it.. Karl Steinle. Okay. I've seen quite some more hands up for questions. We continue here with Andrew. Ritchie, Thomas Fossard and then Vikram.. Andrew Ritchie. Is it working? Yes. Uli, in the past you've talked about one thing to exceed your 900 basis. points over risk-free target ROE. You even mentioned; I can't remember when it last was,. it probably would have been in full year results, loosely and sort of you'd really like to. keep it above 12. Is that still a kind of loose unofficial target?. Ulrich Wallin. Well it's still an internal target I would say. Of course, it's getting more difficult to achieve. that with the increased capital. But we still believe that this is a target which we will strive. to achieve. We may not achieve it every year. But I think it's still within our underlying. business model.. Thomas Fossard. Thomas Fossard from HSBC. I've got two questions, first one is on the cash flow metrics.. Could you come back on why kind of Hannover Re cash flows are superior to EBIT and. what is specificity of the Hannover Re business compared to peers in this respect?. And the second question would be related to the first question is on the mix of your. business growth, should we expect any synergies which potentially could have some. implication on the AUM growth, strong growth that you posted over the previous years?. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well I guess the more positive cash flow comes back to the reason that we had a higher. percentage of non-proportional business than our peers had to some extent. And the. non-proportional business normally gives you better cash flows and the proportional. business where of course you pay higher commissions and if things go well you also pay a. profit commission on those. That's one of the reasons and we continue to emphasize the. non-proportional business.. I would say we have a fair amount of our business in the long-tail line which is more cash. flow accretive as well. But that, of course, once the long-tail business is going flat in. absolute premiums, then, of course, the cash flow would go flat also on the long-tail. business. And our growth in recent years has been more on the short-tail than the long;. tail business. So I guess it's more the former, higher amount of excess of loss.. Where will the business grow? We continue to defend our non-proportional accounts, in. particular in areas like property per risk where we are one of the market leaders. Marine. excess of loss, non-proportional, credit and surety in the US, casualty clash and nonproportional casualty business in the US. So that will stay and that will, we believe,. continue to provide us with positive cash flows.. On the other hand, the demand is more driving towards proportional business and also a. little bit towards Financial Solutions business which on the P&C side we call advanced. solutions because we like that name. We have that for quite a while.. And of course, that would mean that those premiums provide you with very stable and. secure earnings. But, of course, with less cash flows. So the premium; the cash flow to. premium ratio may actually come down a bit in the short term. It should then increase. again when the market turns.. Karl Steinle. Okay. The next question is from Vikram.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi. It's Vikram Gandhi from SocGen. The first question is on P&C. So at an industry level,. what would you say should be the biggest worry for the investors? Is it reserving. deficiency, inflation shock, maybe an interest rate shock or just the amount of excess. capacity or the number of players?. And the second question is on the Life & Health and I'm referring to slide six. It shows the. Hannover Re's market share has been pretty much flat over the past six years at 11%. But. surely this is on a premium basis I believe where Hannover Re has actually grown a lot on. the deposit accounted business which is not reflected here. So any thoughts around that. would be helpful.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. First of all, on the P&C business, what should be the worry? Of course, if you see a. re-emergence of inflation, you will see that the redundancies in the loss reserve will. evaporate rather quickly. There, of course, it's still helpful to have more rather than less. because it takes a longer time until you get in negative territory. So that would be a. concern on the P&C side.. We have looked into that for Hannover Re and continue to protect against that we are. inflation linkers. So what we did, we looked at the scenario that you have an increased. inflation of 4% for four consecutive years. We calculated our exposure from that. And then. we said we would protect half of that by redundant loss reserves and half of that by. inflation linkers and we continue with that.. You might remember that we used to have these inflation slots which also make some. interesting appearance in the P&L account. With the inflation linkers we are less visible into. P&L account because it goes through the OCI because we are able to hedge accounting. then.. So this, I think inflation is probably is the biggest problem. The other in the current market. where we currently are, there's always the danger of getting things wrong, that you. underwrite poisoned opportunities so to say. And of course, that can happen for us as. well and it happened to us in the past, probably happens as we speak. But we try to have. as little of those mistakes as we can, ideally having some less than our competition.. On the Life & Health side, our premium; the Life & Health premium is quite bulky. And so. the main growth that we want to achieve on the Life & Health is the bottom line because. our most profitable Life & Health business; and Klaus will give you a presentation of that;. is the Financial Solutions business and on that, we are not booking at lot of premium.. If I give you an example, last year admittedly we had some one-off effects. Our US. Financial Solutions, the premium was exactly the same as EBIT. And this year even without. one-off effects, on that block of business, it's still pretty much the same. So we are not. that concerned if we don't grow our market share based on premium. Then, of course,. we want to grow our market share is the profit pool that the business presents.. Karl Steinle. Okay. I see we have already stretched the Q&A a little bit. There's two more questions,. one is from Jon Urwin and from Thomas Seidl.. Jonny Urwin. Hi there. It's Jonny Urwin from UBS. Just thinking about your combined ratio a bit. You. mentioned that you'd like to keep the combined ratio down at sort of 96%. If you were to. defend at those levels, would you need to relax from, say, conservatism, i.e., lower initial. loss base, because I guess given the pricing reductions that we're seeing, if you're. keeping them flat then that is a source of relaxation anyway. But do you need to go. further than that?. Ulrich Wallin. Well the answer to your first question is yes, because this is soft market, the quality of the. business and the underlying earning parts of business has reduced. That is not so. surprising because we are reducing rates for four consecutive years. The entire portfolio. probably not that dramatically. But certainly this has an effect.. What it basically means that we will probably not add to the loss reserve redundancies if. we take out of the redundancies, it's really a factor of the major losses, all the major. losses creeping up to the large loss budget or not? Of course, I'd say below the large. loss budget, that helps so you don't need to reduce the sufficiency of the loss reserves.. It also will have a little bit to do with the emergence of inflation because then, of course,. the redundancies will automatically reduce regardless of the quality of the business. But. it's very clear and we said that all along. We build up those buffers because we had a very. comfortable situation with our earnings. So we didn't have the pressure to show more. earnings than the underlying business actually created. And therefore we had the luxury of. being able to put up buffers on the loss reserves.. But we also stand ready to use the buffers if it's necessary. I think, of course, you know our. threshold at 2.5% which would mean that with our risk management limit and threshold. systems, then we wouldn't be able to continue any further with that.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Next question please? Please continue.. Thomas Seidl. This is Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Two questions, first on this reserve. So I think like you. and your peers are at the peak reserve level. Doesn't that mean we are in a soft market. for a couple of years because basically your primary insurers know about that and hence. can continue to demand price reductions? First question.. Second question, you showed us that you outperformed in terms of growth not only the. market but also the top five peers of your group particularly in short-tail lines where the. price softening was stronger. So how does it fit to your statement about cycle. management?. Ulrich Wallin. Well on the first one I agree that the industry is well reserved and that, of course, would. prolong the softening market. There's no question because it allows the reinsurers to. report acceptable results even if the underlying earnings may not fully be supportive of. those results.. But I think in the industry, the level of sufficiency on the loss reserves is probably gradually. coming down. So I would still say that a major loss event would create a change in the. market like in 2011. But it would be measured hardening of the market, as I said, it would. not be a dislocation and one year of good result would basically then create a trend. downwards again.. So second question was on the growth on the P&C side which was quite pronounced,. particularly in 2015. How does that go together with cycle management? I think we have. improved our position with many of our major clients, therefore we have opportunities. also on some larger transactions. And in 2015 we just have been quite successful that a. few of those did actually, or a comparatively large number of those did actually come to. fruition. And we were able to get our necessary margins and our necessary pricing on. those.. That masks the underlying reduction in volume on what I would call the flow business. For. next year and this year to some extent we are working, we always work large transactions.. But you have years where in the end nothing transpires and that's absolutely fine because. the basic business is a flow business.. But as we are asked to work on them by our clients, there's, of course, also the. opportunity that they may come to fruition and therefore that means that the volume is. increasing rather than decreasing than it should. But as long as on those larger. transactions we get our rates and our margins, we are happy to entertain those.. What we are not having entertained so far to any large extent is to writing large US. casualty treaties on a proportional basis where there is a lot of demand from the. reinsurance; from the insurance market in the US.. We are a little bit shying away from those, mainly because of the experience that we had. on our US casualty business in the last soft market at the end of the '90s, where we found. that despite the fact that the rates were a lot lower than now, that all the many small. treaties that we have with a large number of our clients did not hurt us.. What hurt us were the few large proportional treaties that we rolled and therefore our. special underwriting guidelines for our US casualty business has a provision in that a single. treaty is limited in size as compared to the overall portfolio and we continue to adhere to. that.. Karl Steinle. Okay. Well thank you for your questions. We have scheduled now a short break. So you will. find coffee, tea and biscuits out of this room. We will resume in around 15 minutes. So 10. minutes later than scheduled at 10:40. Thank you.. Okay. Well thanks for taking your seats again. These days anything that happens more. than twice can already be described as a tradition. By that yardstick it has become a. longstanding tradition at Hannover Re that we take a close look at the desk of our CFO. from quite a few different angles.. Today we are going to compare the measurement approaches on the IFRS and Solvency. II and consider the reconciliation from one perspective to the other. Needless to say, we. cannot get away without an update on investments either. Given how many important or. newsworthy matters pass over Roland's desk, I think we can carry on with that title for the. presentation for the years to come.. Don't you agree, Roland?. Roland Vogel. Yes. Thank you, Karl. Yes, I was going to say the same thing. It is a little bit a tradition every. time you think about preparing for the presentation, you look what is on the desk and you. ask yourself as to whether it makes more sense for you to go deep into one thing or to. cope with one or two different topics.. For this presentation, I have prepared two and a half, I would say, although the half is. more a housekeeping issue and I still hope I can enlighten you on something. So we found. out that during the speech of the CEO, the share price had outperformed the market by a. % so maybe we'll now find out what I can do on top of that all as to whether it disappears. in the area and so this is how we measure ourselves.. So Karl has already mentioned and I mentioned there are two and a half topics. First of all,. of course, you cannot hide before the low interest rate environment. And I have prepared. a little bit deeper look into the most concerning area which would be the euro. And I will. be giving you the regular update I could say on reinvestment deals, what does that mean,. how do we look into the future.. Then the housekeeping issue would be how do we at Hannover Re calculate the ROIs. which are used for all these guidances and reportings we are given or we do give. Then I. have this comparison between the two reporting regimes for Solvency II and IFRS. And so. we gave a translation for the day one accounting at the beginning of the year. We will do. that also for the half year numbers.. This time I will concentrate, as I'm the bookkeeper, only on the owned funds and Andreas. will come after me with all the fancy actuarial stuff and ratios and all that and we will also, I. will try to give you a little bit of flavor of which were the drivers between the numbers and. the comparisons between IFRS and Solvency II. And we can even have a philosophic. discussion with that which I will not go too much into detail.. So let's potentially start with the investment update. Of course, the most frequently asked. question, FAQ, I'll be getting, how do you cope with the low interest yield environment. and in some cases, this is not even a low interest rate environment, it is a negative. interest rate environment. On this page, I think there are a lots of ways to display all that.. You see the areas of the world, all the currencies, or the countries where we -- with. regards to sovereign risk, we still are in positive range and where we are already in. negative range. So for instance in Switzerland and Japan up to the 10-year range, you. cannot find any positive yielding risk-free securities.. That changes a little bit with Germany. You see that this was as of June, 2016 and we had. been in negative range with longer dated maturities as well, as we all know. You can also. go down the route a little bit here to other countries like Italy and Spain. And in the shortterm durations, we are in negative territory here as well. Which means for the business. which generates money for only shorter term durations, we in negative territory. And how. do we cope with that and how is this reflected in our internal measures.. We cannot escape that reality. And we have to reflect it in our internal measures. And I. had been asked at occasions before, how much are you invested into securities with",20161020_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Guidance_Call_2016-10-20_SD000000002902464788.pdf,2016-10-20
30,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re Conference. Call on the Q1 2021 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At. this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Jean-Jacques Henchoz,. Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. presenting our results for the first quarter of 2021. Sorry to those of you particularly who. are London-based, for the inconvenience due to the unusual early time of this call. The. reason is as per last year that the Annual Shareholders Meeting is taking place later this. morning at 11:00 AM CET.. As usual, I'll start with an overview before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the. financial details -- financials in detail. I'll then comment on the outlook. And for the Q&A I'm. additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller on the Life side and Sven Althoff. for P&C.. I'm pleased to report that Hannover Re had a good start into 2021. In the first quarter of. the year, we continued to successfully grow our business. And Group net income of. EUR306 million is very much in line with our full-year guidance. Additionally, at 11.1% the. return on equity is well above our minimum target. And gross premium increased by. 16.8% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by our property and casualty. business group, where we recorded remarkable topline growth of 20% on the back of. improving market conditions.. In the first quarter, technical profitability in P&C returned to a normal level. There was. some loss activity during the quarter where large losses stayed within the budget. In. addition, our net estimate for COVID-19 related losses remained unchanged compared to. year-end 2020 at EUR950 million. Hence, the combined ratio of 96.2% is not only in line. with our planning, but also a good reflection of the improving underlying profitability in the. first quarter.. As expected, the results of our Life and Health Reinsurance business group continues to. be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the high number of deaths in. January and February in the United States also led to losses in our in-force portfolio.. Overall losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR151 million, slightly higher than. initially expected.. As indicated in March the, restructuring within our US mortality portfolio led to a positive. one-off effect of EUR129 million, offsetting a large part of the COVID impact in Life and. Health. To be clear, this restructuring for our ING portfolio does not affect the business. reinsured by Hannover Re. However, a change in the ownership of the ceding company. allowed for some other changes, in particular with regards to the collateral structure.. Finally, we recorded pleasing premium growth of 8.6% adjusted for currency effects. At. 2.5%, the return on investment is fairly well in line with expectations overall, and the. capitalization according to Solvency II continued to be excellent confirmed by the very. strong solvency ratio of 252% at the end of the first quarter, well above our threshold of. 200%.. The operating cash flow in the first quarter was a particularly strong EUR1.7 billion, mainly. driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very solid results on the investment. side. On top of that, the restructuring within our US mortality portfolio led to a positive. operating cash flow of around EUR640 million. Driven by this positive cash flow, total. assets under own management increased to a record high of EUR52.5 billion. This growth. was additionally supported by ForEx effect and the issuance of the EUR750 million in. hybrid capital in March.. This new bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total hybrid capital to. EUR3 billion. We still have flexibility in regards to our total hybrid capacity, and. shareholders' equity was rather stable in the first quarter of 2021. Market movements. again had a strong impact in the first quarter and the negative change in unrealized gains. due to increased interest rates was stronger than the positive impact from currency. translation. Altogether, the net income was enough to bring the balance back into positive. territory.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens who will explain the figures in more detail.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Good morning, everyone. Moving on directly to the. segmental reporting, I will start with the development of our Property and Casualty. business group. Gross written premium grew by a remarkable 20% adjusted for currency. effects. Based on the January renewals, the growth in our traditional reinsurance portfolio. is stemming mainly from Europe although premium volume also increased in the US and in. Asia. On top of this, we were also able to successfully conclude a number of (inaudible 14:58) in our structured reinsurance. This shouldn't come as a surprise as we had. mentioned our healthy pipeline in this area several times. Furthermore, the recognition of. premium from the underwriting year 2020 was material and also supported the growth in. the first quarter. This effect is generally most pronounced in the first quarter and should. therefore not repeat itself in the coming quarters. The two latter effects are also the main. reasons for the more pronounced growth in the first quarter compared to the premium. growth reported for the 1-1 renewal.. Major losses came in at EUR193 million, slightly below our quarterly budget of EUR215. million. And just as a reminder, in line with our usual practice, as you know we have kept. the unused part of the budget within our IBNR as a buffer for the remainder of the year.. Even more importantly, we did not have any reasons to adjust our net loss estimate for. COVID-19 in the first quarter while the gross loss estimated actually increased slightly. This. was offset by our retro protection.. The runoff of our reserves was slightly negative in the first quarter, but this development. is more a one-off in nature and does not reflect any general negative trend in our. portfolio. However, as we've not changed our conservative reserving approach, I would. expect the confidence level of our reserves to be stable compared to year-end 2020.. Altogether, the 96.2% combined ratio is in line with our expectation.. Ordinary investment income was stable while realized gains were lower than in previous. years, explaining the decrease in our net investment income. Nevertheless, the first. quarter 2021 also benefited from realized gains because we sold some of our listed. equities. Other income and expenses amounted to minus EUR91 million, mainly driven by. negative currency effect of EUR82 million. Altogether, the EBIT increased to EUR324. million, thanks to the improved underwriting results. Finally, the tax ratio was below the. normal level due to a favorable earnings contribution from lower tax subsidiaries.. On the next slide, total net large losses accounted for EUR193 million in the first quarter,. again EUR221 million below the budget. There -- I think there's not a lot more to say on. this slide, so I will directly move on to our detailed large loss overview.. As you can see on the next slide, the largest individual event was the Texas freeze with a. total net loss of EUR75 million, adding to storm in Spain since the Australian flood. The net. impact from nat cat was EUR105 million, hardly a severely impacted quarter for Hannover. Re. On the man-man -- on the man-made side though the quarter was more active with. one satellite loss and four property claims, leading to a net loss burden of EUR88 million.. The next slide shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting line. The. picture for the first quarter is a mixed one. As is usual for an individual quarter, the. combined ratio is slightly above the target in some line or region, mainly due to large. losses and slightly better than the target in other areas. I see this as a confirmation of the. benefit of our highly diversified portfolio.. One comment just on credit and surety, which looks part -- particularly good. The. government programs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are still in place and have. certainly had a positive impact on the reported numbers. Therefore, the good 83. combined ratio is the result of the actual loss development in the first quarter and not. driven by any reserve releases related to COVID-19. Overall, again the 96.2% combined. ratio was very close to our target.. So, let's move on to Life and Health; the pleasing premium growth highlights the fact that. our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit, given that it's mainly driven by the APAC region. and by longevity. The technical result is affected by losses in connection with COVID-19. As. in previous quarters, the main impact is coming from our US portfolio. Apart from the US,. the bulk of the losses are from South Africa and to a lesser extent from other countries.. As indicated in March, the restructuring part of the ING portfolio in our US mortality book. led to a positive one-off effect of EUR129 million. So when you look at this effect of. EUR129 million, it might sound a bit complicated now, so I will try -- because this one-off. shows up in three different lines in the P&L. First, the transfer of some assets as part of. the funds withheld led to a positive valuation gain of EUR86 million. The restructuring of. the collateral agreements had a positive impact of EUR58 million in the other income and. expenses, and the valuation effect of the ModCo derivative was minus EUR14 million. So,. as mentioned by Jean-Jacques, this adds up to the EUR129 million offsetting therefore a. large part of our COVID-19 losses in the first quarter.. The ordinary investment income was in line with our expectations while the fair value of. financial instruments was significantly negative in the first quarter. This is driven by the. valuation of the derivatives embedded in the Life Reinsurance contract. Unfortunately, this. derivative creates some volatility because the corresponding positive effect of the. liabilities is not visible in our IFRS accounts due to IFRS accounting regime. Taking an. economic view, the negative impact is to some extent offset.. Other income and expenses are mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution. from our Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which was recognized according. to the deposit accounting method. Currency effects this quarter was slightly positive. All in. all, the EBIT of EUR80 million is affected by a number of larger individual effects. Adjusted. for COVID losses, the positive one-off from US mortality and the negative derivative. valuation, the result would have been in line with our expectations. At 37.9%, the tax ratio. is above normal level driven by the taxation business but I'd caution you not to read too. much into quarterly tax rate.. On the next slide, for Life and Health premium development, it's just one way to measure. growth. But what is probably even more important is the value of new business. On the. next slide, you can see that we were quite active in our reporting categories and also the. pipeline for new business remains very healthy. By region, North America, APAC and the. UK for longevity are currently the most promising. But European markets like Germany. and France may also bring some new opportunities.. Looking at the indicator for the new business value at the bottom, the first quarter was. particularly strong. As you know, actions in life and health are rather bumpy and the value. of new business also closely linked to the duration of the business written. In any case, I. see our Life and Health business group is being well on track in terms of new business. production.. The next slide, development of our investments, in the first quarter I think it was very. satisfactory. The ordinary investment income is in line with our expectations. On the one. hand, our portfolio of inflation-linked bond, as you know, is to some extent still affected by. lower inflation. On the other hand, the return from alternative investment is back to higher. levels compared to the previous year. Around EUR50 million of the realized gains are. linked to the partial disposal of listed equities. The remainder is the result of normal. portfolio maintenance in a low yield environment.. Listed equities are not really a strategically important asset class for us. Therefore, the. realization was rather opportunistic following the strong performance of equity markets.. Additionally, we still have our desired exposure to private equity, as you know.. Impairments and depreciations are comparable to last year but still on a really moderate. level.. As explained in my comments on Life and Health, the derivative valuation was negative. explaining the majority of the decrease in investment income compared to the previous. year. The overall return on investment was 2.5%, meaning that we are well on track to. achieve our full-year target of roughly 2.4%.. Unrealized gains decreased by almost EUR1 billion due to the increase in interest rate, but. are still on a very high level at about EUR2 billion. More importantly, the rising interest. rates are of course positive for the new money yield even if the overall interest rate levels. are very low.. On the next slide, the asset allocation, as you can see, remained rather stable in the first. quarter 2021. The only notable change I'd mention is that we slightly increased the share. of profit to 32%. Here, we invested according to a broad-based approach with a focus on. developed market. The mentioned disposal of listed equities is not really visible here in. this overview and the rounded number is still at 1%. The contribution to ordinary. investment income is diversified, as usual. It's particularly pleasing to see that the. contribution from private equity recovered to the strong levels that we had seen before. the market volatility caused by the pandemic in 2020.. To conclude my remarks, the overall result for the first quarter 2021 does include few. larger extraordinary effects as you can see, but both the reported net income and the. underlying business development support our guidance for the full year. And I hereby. hand back to you, Jean-Jacques, for the target metrics and the outlook.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much, Clemens. On the next slide, you see the target metrics, which. confirms that we had a good start to 2021. Growth, as mentioned earlier, is significantly. ahead of the strategic targets and our main profitability target for the Group, the ROE is. well above the minimum target and the industry average.. The treaty renewals as at 1st of April, 2021 we're also successful for Hannover Re. Both. the premium development and the price improvements are very much in line with the. trends we saw in the January renewals. In the US, we particularly benefited from the. underlying improvement in primary markets and we're able to generate a double-digit. growth. In Japan, growth was slightly lower but overall in line with our expectations.. And for the cat business, the reinsurance rate improved further on the back of the heavy. loss burden in 2018 and 2019. Continued positive trends could also be observed in our. aviation and marine portfolios. Overall, our premium in the April renewals increased by. 7.4%. The risk adjusted price change was about 5% positive. Looking at -- only at the nonproportional business, the price increase was even higher at 9%.. Based on the favorable renewals in January and April, we see further opportunity to grow. our highly diversified portfolio in an attractive market environment. And I would expect the. general pricing trends affecting the reinsurance industry to persist in 2021 and to carry on. into 2022. Influencing factors will be the amplitude of further COVID-19 impact for the. industry and also the large loss situation as usual. We still feel comfortable with our P&C. reserving for COVID-19 related losses and currently, we do not expect a material impact. in 2021.. In Life and Health Reinsurance, growth is expected to be well supported by our strategic. initiatives and most pronounced in longevity and financial solutions. In the latter case, this. volume indication also includes business which is booked according to the deposit. accounting method and is therefore not visible in the premium income. In mortality, further. losses from the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to decrease significantly compared to. the first quarter, mainly driven by the progress of vaccination programs around the world. but particularly in the US. The premium is expected to be slightly lower, mainly due to the. natural decrease in our in-force book and our limited appetite for new business in the. most competitive, traditional life segments, particularly in the US and the UK markets. In. morbidity, the overall development is more stable.. As mentioned by Clemens, the business development in the first quarter of the year. supports our guidance for the full year. On the premium guidance, it even supports a. slightly higher growth rate and we have increased our expectation to a high single-digit. growth rate. We have kept guidance for Group net income unchanged. On the one hand,. of course the slightly higher assumptions for growth will filter through the bottom line. On. the other hand, the impact from COVID-19 was a little higher than expected in the first. quarter. Finally, I can reconfirm our positive view of the dividend policy and the potential to. pay a special dividend if profit targets are reached and the capitalization remains strong.. This concludes my remarks and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you. very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions) And the first question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now. open. Please go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Good morning. Thank you, and hope everything is okay with everybody. So my two. questions please, one is the -- Jean-Jacques, you mentioned the pricing effect and you. mentioned an optimistic outlook for 2022. And you mentioned some factors including. COVID. Could you just elaborate a bit? Is it because you think COVID discussions haven't. actually had the opportunity to take place this year and that's why some of these effects. could roll over into next year's pricing? So, that's my first question. Or any other factors. you would like to highlight for next year would be helpful as well.. And second question is the mortality COVID effect, the EUR151 million total, but only. EUR105 million in the US. But -- so the ex-US, you mentioned South Africa, could you just. elaborate, is there some other risks because so far at the marketplace we've mostly. been focused on US mortality, partly UK. And also -- I mean in that context, does. something like the Indian situation bother you at all in terms of loss risks? So just any. comment on ex-US COVID mortality which seemed a bit higher than what I would have. imagined. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you for that. Just on the first question, you have several drivers for pricing of. course. You have the large loss activity in the past few years. The interest rate. environment of course puts some additional pressure. On COVID, as mentioned, I think. we were -- we're of the view that we are well reserved conservatively across the lines of. business affected, but there are some uncertainty on client-by-client basis. And in some. instances, this will still be a point on the agenda as we renew some of the businesses in. January.. So, I think you still will see the -- some impact and some further price pressure on the. cadence [ph] given the burden of COVID. As of end of last year of course, we had a much. better view on the overall exposure. But this is work in progress and this will be very much. on a client by client basis.. Maybe on the Life and Health ex-US, UK, Klaus can address that.. Klaus Miller. Yes. And then, the COVID claims, excluding the US, in our portfolio are mainly from Latin. America and South Africa. The worst country in Latin America is probably right now Brazil,. but not in our portfolio. We have hardly any business in Brazil. But Chile, Colombia, even. Mexico to some extent, have caused losses in our portfolio. It's just in the double digits. and I don't know how long this will continue. It's nothing what we are really worried about. in terms of our bottom line result.. South Africa, the team [ph] -- vaccination has not really started there and we have a lot of. financing business as well in South Africa, which can absorb a lot of COVID claims. But. including the mortality covers we provide, this is also I guess single digit, maybe doubledigit loss in the first quarter.. India is of not much importance for our bottom line against the total premium. Premium is. in the single-digit millions and that has absolutely no impact on the bottom line for us.. These are the largest markets outside the US and UK. Europe as such is not really a. problem so far. Please keep in mind that we have shifted our portfolio to financial. solutions and longevity in the last 10 years, to a large extent. This definitely helps in this. situation.. Vinit Malhotra. Thanks, Klaus.. Klaus Miller. I hope that answers the question.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you.. Operator. The next question is from Michael Haid, Commerzbank. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much and good morning to everyone. Two questions, both on the P&C Re.. You mentioned the COVID-19 related losses, the estimate is unchanged at EUR950. million. It appears that new COVID-19 related losses are fully covered by retro, which is. somewhat counter-intuitive. Can you explain why this is the case and how the mechanics. works here?. Second question, the strong growth in P&C Re 20.1%, you mentioned that some of this. comes from structured reinsurance. However, I thought that premiums from structured. reinsurance are generally deposit accounted. So, can you elaborate a little bit how. structured reinsurance plays into this strong growth and whether this strong growth was. affected by some large order share transactions or anything like that?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. I guess so Sven will address both points.. Sven Althoff. On the COVID side, as Clemens explained, our gross position has only increased a little. bit. So, the gross claim grew by approximately 3%. This was coming out of mainly. property-related, so business interruption related new loss advisors from our ceding. companies, and we saw a little bit of movement on the contingency side. So, the property. is covered by our retrocessional protection and the small increase from non-propertyrelated lines. We have eliminated by adjusting other lines very gradually downwards in. order to keep with the overall EUR950 million, which is an overall conservative number. So,. we wanted to have stability on that side in the first quarter.. When it comes to the growth, the ramp up of the 2020 business comes both from the. traditional business and from the advanced solutions business, which we have written at. the 1/4 renewals and later last year. The reason why Advanced Solutions is also. significantly contributing in that aspect is that the amount of business we write on a. deposit accounted basis in our P&C structured reinsurance practice is very, very small. indeed. So we -- it would be more the exception than the norm that we have deposit. accounted business in our structured P&C business. So, they contribute exactly like -- any. traditional quota share, for example, would contribute. And given that we are talking. about business that was written up, that 1-1 last year, as Clemens said, this impact will. phase out over the next couple of quarters.. But to give you a more detail, when we reported about our growth in Q1 2020, 25% of. that number at the time came from underwriting years 2019 and prior. And we are now. reporting about our growth in the first quarter of 2021. A remarkable 50% of that growth. is coming from the previous underwriting years. So if you put the growth into the. categories, the underwriting year 2020 and prior, it's more than we expected. When we. look at underwriting year 2021, the growth we are seeing is very much in line with the. premium growth we reported in early February when we talked about our January. renewals.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Very helpful.. The next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi, there. I joined the call a bit late, so apologies if you've addressed these topics. The. first question was, could you just give us a color as to the FX noise in the other income in. non-life? Why it is so large? How can I forecast or how can I -- what are the main. sensitivities and what was driving it? I think the fact that -- EUR82 million inside.. Second question, so could you just give us a bit more color on your outlook for mid-year. renewals -- but definitely, a bit more discussion with the weather, there is an accelerating. softening trend or still decent rate correction, maybe give us a sense how much of your. mid-year renewal is on sort of loss affected business?. And the final question, could you just give us a bit color behind your decision to raise. more debt in the quarter? It doesn't seem like from the outside that you particularly. needed it given your strong solvency and no imminent refinancing. So what was the. thinking? Is it purely opportunistic? Do you feel the need to run at a particularly high capital. coverage in anticipation of growth or some other metric that would be useful, just some. color on that would be great. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Andrew, and I'll give the question on ForEx to Clemens and also probably the. hybrid capital and then mid-year renewal for Sven.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes, good morning, Andrew. Colleagues are looking [ph] at me with respect to the FX. effect in P&C because it's actually an accounting question, so that goes to the CFO,. because again it's an accounting one, it's not an economic effect. The reason is, the. stronger -- mainly the stronger US dollar in the first quarter development of the US dollar,. that's the underlying reason for it. And as we re-evaluate our balance sheet, both on the. liability and asset side or the liability effect flows through the P&L, that's the currency. effect where it's on the asset side. Only so called liquid assets, monetary assets that are. classified under IFRS flows through the P&L and the other in fact goes straight into the. currency OCI for particularly our non-monetary US product assets, for example, our huge. US sort of private equity portfolio.. You will have seen an opposite effect last year where we reported a gain on the P&C. side. So, it add a certain volatility of course to our results. But the movements were quite. significant to the last year, as you know, in the US dollar and this year as well. So, that sort. of flows through the P&L. However, again there is a fully offsetting effect in our P&L.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Would you want to address the debt or shall we go first to the mid-year -- mid-year. renewals, outlook?. Sven Althoff. Yes, on what we have seen at 1/4 is that the momentum on the rate side is -- was. relatively unchanged to what we saw at the 1st of January renewal, both on the insurance. and on the reinsurance side. When you ask about 1st of June, 1st of July renewals, we. expect that positive trend to continue. There is some first sign of slowing down in the. momentum but the direction of travel is still up, I mean we're not talking about an SP4. Where we are particularly seeing more pressure is on proportional treaties where ceding. companies are arguing that in their business they have achieved two, very often three. round of rate increases. So, they are not really prepared to decrease their Ceding. Commissions further due to the fact that the underlying profitability of the business. should be significantly better. So, that's what we are seeing.. The bulk of the business we will renew at 1st of June and 1st of July is coming from the US. and Australia. US was a heavy loss year. As you know, last year was Hurricane Laura and. various tornadoes, and so from that point of view we see little reason why that business. should see a lesser rate momentum compared to the one business we have written in. the US.. Australia on the other hand had difficult years in 2019. 2020 a lot of that was already taken. into account when we last renewed that business. The last 12 months were not loss free,. but didn't experience the same sort of loss good [ph] in Australia. So here, I would expect. that we still see rate increases but maybe not as high as we could report a year ago. So. overall, the trend is still very much intact. But maybe the rate increases we will be able to. report when we talk about Q2 will come a little below what we could now report at 1st of. April and 1st of January.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yeah, and just briefly on the hybrid, I mean it does give us -- as you've seen in our. Solvency II rate as well, it does give us some buffer -- provide some buffer both in. Solvency II, but also in our rating capital models. So there is some headroom for us, not. necessarily been in the first quarter of course. But we thought the market environment. was very good, so we took the chance and it was an opportunistic move in March, again. to provide us with some buffers to take advantage of the good pricing environment and. the market environment and the opportunities in the market.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. And just to respond to also a part of your question, Andrew, there is no different. fairly high solvency ratio. But combined with the opportunistic nature of that death rising,. that gives us a photography of the situation as of end of March. But there is no change in. Andrew Ritchie. Operator. ahead.. Jochen Schmitt. Thank you. Good morning. I have one question on your ordinary investment income from. private equity in Q1 2021. Does this include any specialty within or any valuation effect?. That's my question.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. Clemens will address that.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes -- no, it's really just ordinary distributions from our private equity funds. It's a variety of. private equity funds. There is no special effect in there, and no evaluation effects. We. don't evaluate our private equity investments through P&L. It all goes through the OCI.. There are positive effects in the OCI actually, but I think it's very pleasing what we saw. compared to last year in terms of ordinary investments, the results from private equity. (Technical Difficulty) in excess of first part of 2020.. Jochen Schmitt. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question is from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead.. Kamran Hossain. Hi, good morning. Just one question from me, and apologies if I missed this detail. I. of helps out in situations, kind of pandemic situations. Just wanted to ask, how close are. you to triggering this and how much cover does it provide? I guess given the situation. elsewhere in the world, the US, the UK seems to be getting a bit better. Does it also. include non-US deaths, any color on that would be really helpful. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes, Klaus?. Klaus Miller. Yes. The cover we have bought is currently at $255 million capacity and the trigger is. defined as the weighted average of the population mortality of three countries, the US,. the UK and Australia. We picked these three because they have the higher sums of risk in. our portfolio. The weights are about 60% US, about 22% UK and about 18% Australia.. Currently the trigger starts at 100% of this weighted population mortality and it ends at. 100%, so it's 10 percentage point. And the $255 million mean that each percentage point. in excess of 110 is worth $25.5 million. Currently, we are pretty close at -- or to the trigger. point of $110 million. Not much is expected from Australia in the rest of the year, just. normal mortality. So, it will not increase the cost of Australia. It will probably also not. increase further due to UK because COVID claims are significantly reduced. And the US,. we have to wait what happens there. Currently, there are still about 500 claims a day. I. don't expect a large payout from that. And hopefully, this is not the case because that. would mean that we have the COVID pandemic under control. So, this is only linked to. population mortality in these three countries.. Kamran Hossain. Okay, that's clear. Thanks very much.. Operator. And the next question is from Vikram Gandhi, Societe Generale. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hi, good morning everybody. It's Vikram, Soc Gen. I've got a couple of questions. First is. on the deposit accounted treaties contribution which ended EUR90 million for this quarter. versus EUR85 million Q1 2020. Can you give us a bit more color if there is a slowdown in. the growth that we have been used to in the past or is it more of -- because it's a lumpy. business Q1 was a slightly lower growth quarter and you might expect the growth to pick. up in the coming quarters? So any comments there would be really useful.. And second was on the cyber insurance, can you just explain how the book is shaping up?. What were the premiums for the full-year 2020 and how the things are looking for the. current year? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Sven, Financial Solutions business?. Sven Althoff. The Financial Solutions business is pretty stable, not impacted by the COVID pandemic. right now. And in -- we have two countries where most of the Financial Solutions business. is coming from, one is the US, the other is China. The US is up to 20 years, so this is more. long-term. China is significantly small-term but at least for the next 2 years or 3 years we. don't expect significant shift here. And we hope that we can write more business in the. near future. So, this is something what we see as a stable contributor to our bottom line. result.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. (inaudible - 54:48) and on the other question?. Sven Althoff. On the cyber portfolio, this continues to be a growing class for Hannover Re. So in 2020,. we wrote approximately EUR300 million of cyber reinsurance premium. As you know, we. were able at 1st of July renewals onwards from last year to reduce the silent cyber. exposure on non-affirmative cyber business, which created some further headroom for us. in order to keep growing our affirmative cyber portfolio. And for 2021, we had a successful. start to the year where we could either increase shares on existing contracts or even write. a few more. So, we are going to approach a premium volume here EUR400 million for the. full underwriting year 2021.. Our loss experience continues to be favorable in this class. We have seen an uptick in the. loss frequency in the last 18 months. But the business we write is still well within the. were writing it. So from that point of view, we see this as a good contribution to further. increase the earnings capability of our P&C practice.. Okay, thank you very much.. Operator. And there are currently no further questions. (Operator Instructions) And the next. question is from Emanuele Musio, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go. ahead. Emanuele Musio, your line is now open. Please go ahead. We can't hear you at the. moment.. Emanuele Musio. Hello, hi, sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on the. combined ratio. Can you please give us an indication of where the line profitability stands. compared to last year, or maybe you can otherwise give me an indication of what the. contribution from prior-year development was this year? Is it comparable to 2020? Is it. more -- just some color about that, please.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Emanuele. Sven?. Sven Althoff. Yes, to the prior year development, as Clemens has said, that came in a little less good. compared to where we were a year ago due to some impact on our short-take classes. [ph]. For example, the winter storm in Texas was mostly resulting from business which we. wrote in underwriting year 2020. So, this showed some negative run off therefore for our. 2020 property business. The run-off result for our long-take classes, casualty in particular,. was good, was positive, so no concerns from that side.. And as to your first question, I mean of course we are satisfied with the start to the year. with our 96.2% combined ratio. So, this makes us more confident that we will achieve our. target of 96% or better at the end of the year. But of course the, year has only just. started. So, there is a lot of exposure on the wind side waiting for us in the next couple of. quarters. So at this stage, I would say it's a good start. It seems to reconfirm our guidance. on that side. But we would not be more bullish than that at this stage.. Emanuele Musio. Thank you.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And we haven't received any further questions at this point. So, I. hand back to the speakers for closing remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you very much for joining this early call. So, I think we handled the key topics. We. wanted to show that we had a solid starting to the year with these quarterly results on the. back of successful P&C renewals and good momentum in pricing and conditions with. strong growth that you've seen and the net Corona loss estimate, which is unchanged.. In Life and Health of course some uncertainties remain, but we believe that with the. vaccination programs, particularly in the US, things will improve in the coming quarters, but. of course still some uncertainties. Strong capitalization, we addressed that at the. beginning of the year. And this is reflecting of course the hybrid bond and the outlook is. positive.. We're quite confident about the guidance. We changed of course the topline guidance. reflecting the P&C business. But as Sven mentioned, it's a bit early in the year to look at it. in more detail. There is still some uncertainty. There is still some nat cat activity which. might be coming later in the next few quarters. But all in all, we're very positive about the. outlook for 2021 and feel very comfortable with the guidance.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. So,. you may disconnect now.",20210505_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2021-5-5_DN000000002956339792.pdf,2021-05-05
31,"Operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on 1st of January 2019 P&C Treaty Renewals. For your information, this. conference is being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you very much. And good morning to our -- today's renewals conference call. I'm. joined by Sven Althoff, who is responsible for our P&C business, in particular, the speciality. lines. And he will help me to give you the details of the renewal fees net 1/1. And I will also. give you updated guidances for 2019. And also, one for 2018, which is, of course, a little. bit more concrete because book closing activities have been going on for some while.. If we look at market situation and the market condition, the 1/1 renewal -- first, just to say,. of course, that we have had significant cap losses in 2017, which resulted in slight rate. increases for 2018. But certainly below expectations of many observers. Then in 2018, we. had, actually, quite a lot more cap losses to, again, a year, which is above, say, the 10-year. average on cap losses. In addition, we had a number of rather significant man-made. losses.. So from a large-loss point of view, 2018 was better than 2017. But it was certainly a lot. worse than the years 2012 to 2016. That had resulted in some further slight hardening of. the market. But not a lot. I mean, it's, again, only a very slight drift up in the overall quality. of the premiums of the reinsurance market.. The capacity in the market has remained very resilient to those losses, both on the. traditional capacity as well as on the ILS capacity, the reductions were rather small. So. there was still more capacity offered than there was a demand from the reinsurance. buyer, which meant -- which means, that, largely, still continues to be a buyer's market. rather than a seller's market.. The -- if I said -- I mean, there's a -- say, if the capital remains stable, however, I would also. say that the demand for reinsurance had also increased a little bit, driven to quite some. extent by primary insurance company involved in large commercial business had. experienced quite a lot of volatility to their results in 2017 and 2018. And it has the. ambition to manage those volatilities and reinsurance, of course, is a very good tool to. manage such volatilities of the primary insurer, their result. And therefore, we have seen. additional demand. We also had seen additional demand from capital-management point. of view, they are particularly based on risk-based regulation like Solvency II, also like. reinsurance can help ceding companies to reduce their cost of capital and, therefore, run. their capital more efficiently. And we have also seen increased demand on that front.. Then, also, cyber insurance continued to see some growth and new kind of opportunity to. grow the business by, derivatively, small at this time is reinsurance that is developed in. collaboration with the newly arrived InsurTech market.. On the ILS market, the retro capacity that was available was reduced to some extent, just. to be said that more than 60% of the retro capacity provided worldwide is actually. provided by the ILS markets. And due to heavy losses, they were a little bit more cautious. in providing that capacity, however, it did not have any effects on the pricing of the. reinsurance business at the 1/1 renewal. So all in all, I mean, continued soft market, I would. say.. If you look at our outcome for Hannover Re, overall, we were not too unhappy with the. outcome of our renewals. We managed to improve the rating quality of our book a little. bit, after having being able to improve it also a little bit in 2018. So from that point of view,. if I look at the overall renewed book of business, the pricing should be sufficient to cover. the cost of capital. We, also, managed to grow our book of business double digits -premium grew by 15.4%. And Sven will elaborate on that in more detail. But it is driven, in. particular, by relationship management with some of our larger clients. And territorial wise,. China, North America and Germany have seen the most pronounced growth.. We have seen continued good showing on -- at the renewal season. So we could continue. to underwrite our business selectively. And concentrate on the business that fulfills our. margin requirement.. We, also, were able to place our retros pretty much in line with expectation. So we could. keep the net risk on NatCat in line or inside our -- somewhat our slightly increased risk. appetite for natural catastrophe risk. We still are underweight on cat. And we will continue. to be underweight on cat because part of the cat renewals were still somewhat. disappointing, on last 3 programs we still saw some decreases. And one thing that's for. sure, if you believe that the trend of cat losses is increasing due to global warming, this is. definitely not included in the current pricing of the natural catastrophe business.. This slide should be quite familiar for you, which shows you that there's a time lag on the. financial year of development that you see on the rating quality on the underwriting year,. meaning that half of the premium and earnings that you have in any given financial year. stems from previous years. That means that in 2019, of course, we still have half of the. business that stemmed from 2017 and '18. But the rating quality was even less than we. have seen in 2019.. Therefore, if you look at it, I mean, '16, '17, '18 and '19 are only marginally different when it. comes to the rating quality. This is probably of those for year '16, still most favorable,. because it still benefited from the '15. And '14 year, which were a lot better. And I mean,. '17 is the bottom of the cycle. And then, '18 and '19 slightly better. But all four years, pricing. quality still significantly below, say, the five years, 2012 to 2016. So we are in a, kind of, a. soft market, their margins being under pressure. So it's very important to have a. competitive advantages to outperform the average market player and, of course, at. Hannover Re, the point to our long-standing business relationship and our lower expense. ratio.. With that, I would hand over to Sven on the details of the 1/1 renewals season.. Sven Althoff. Thank you, Ulrich. A very good morning, also, from my side. I apologize in advance, I do. have a cold, just -- but I hope you can hear me well, nonetheless. We are reporting about. our traditional 1/1 renewals today. As you can see, this is approximately 46% of our overall. P&C business. And when we just deduct the structured reinsurance and facultative. reinsurance, 66% of our traditional P&C business. There is no special report on the. structured side this year. You will remember, we had a special report last year. But there. was no special situation for the -- a '19 renewal and the portfolio is mostly stable on the. structured side.. But let me talk a little about the traditional business. You can see that the 1st of January. renewals is the time of year when we are renewing most of our European business, well,. approximately 50% of our U.S. business and 2/3s of our Asian business. When we will. report on our Q1 and Q2 figures, we will also give you an update on the later renewals in. the year. 8% is going to renew until the 1st of April, another 16% then until 1st of July. And. when it comes to the April renewals, of course, we are observing or we will report on the. price increases after the various losses we had in Japan, most notably the Typhoon Jebi.. And in July, we will able to report the impact of the California wildfires, because wildfires. happen relatively late of the year. So the impact on the 1/1 renewals was still relatively. limited. Some programs were already placed, when the full extent of the wildfires. became clear. So the 1st of July renewals will be a better indicator how the market is. repricing the market after those effects.. As Ulrich already said, we were able to show a significant growth with our traditional. business at 1/1. But let me walk you through the slides here in more detail. I mean, as a. start it's worthwhile noting that already in the existing business. So the renewals business,. due to price increase or us increasing our shares a little bit and ceding companies having. more underlying growth themselves, we were able to renew a little more than we have. actually lost through the cancellation and restructuring of treaties, where we had lost EUR. 639 million. But the renewal book alone, leads to a renewal of EUR 665 million. And in. addition to that, we were able to produce additional new business, which were at the bulk. of the underlying growth of 15.4% at this year's renewal and at constant exchange rates.. From a pricing environment point of view, Ulrich already mentioned that, overall, the. market was relatively flat to slightly up. The rate increases we have seen were mostly. coming from the areas that actually had losses in the calendar year 2018. You could also. observe that the trend from the previous years, the higher demand for proportional. reinsurance certainly continued. Very often this additional demand is still driven out of the. internal solvency models, our clients are using for their risk management. And due to our. strong position in the market, i.e., the long-standing and stable client relationships and,. also, our strong financial strength rating, we were very well positioned to take advantage. and write business out of this additional demands from our clients.. Also very notable is the increased volume on the non-proportional business, where we. have managed to write 8.4% more than in the previous years, here the supports through. the rates' change is a little higher than on the proportional side. So here, we can report. 1.1%, as a rate change on our renewal book of business. But also, here as you can see, we. have found additional areas of new business. And I will report on that in a little more detail. when we go through the February's portfolios of our P&C business.. So Slide 14 is summarizing the renewal by line of business. You can see that we, overall,. have an improved pricing environment of positive 0.9%. And also, see that we had. particularly strong growth in North America, Europe and in Asia.. And the worldwide treaty line, where we could grow by 29%, a significant part of that. actually is resulting from China. And while there was pressure on the rating environment. for the entire region was minus 0.4%, on the business where we actually did grow, the. underlying rate development was slightly more positive. The rates development here was. a positive 0.1%. So more or less stable. And this meant that we could write this additional. business taking into account our minimum margin requirements in order to earn our cost. of capital.. The next slide, you can see that those areas where we did see losses in the calendar year. 2019 (sic) (2018), reacted the most when it comes to the price changes. So for example,. you see strong rates development in marine and in credit, surety and political risks, much. more meaningful than in the more benign areas. And I already mentioned that for the rest. of the year, we can expect other areas to also show a little stronger rate development,. notably, Japan and part of the U.S. American portfolio, which is impacted, as I already. mentioned, by the California wildfires. So overall, a relatively flat picture. But was good. reactions in those areas, where we did see more than the average loss situation.. Ulrich already commented on the rate quality for the financial year 2019. On this slide, we. are talking about the price level development from an underwriting-year perspective.. Here, you can see that after the 2019 renewal, we are approaching a pricing level which is. relatively close to the years 2011 and 2015, which were underwriting years, that's from a. rate quality point of view were rather acceptable. So the trend is certainly is showing on a. -- in a positive direction. But with some overspill from a financial-year perspective from the. previous and softer underwriting years into 2019.. Now let me go into the individual portfolios, where I will start with North America. For. North America, we could observe a growth of almost 22%. And this is supported by a -- at. least slightly improved rating environment there's a positive 0.3%. The growth is mainly. coming from existing client relationships on the property side, where there was additional. demand and we could utilize our very strong position with those clients, in order to take. advantage on this side. But we could also broaden our client base, which we have been. able to do over the last couple of years, already. So this is certainly, also, a very pleasing. development.. On the casualty side, we still only see limited growth opportunities. Some did actually. exist. So we grew our casualty portfolio a little bit. But we are still deemphasizing our large. -- the large commercial excess casualty exposure in our writings on the reinsurance side.. Last but not least, we continue to see a strong demand on the cyber side. And like. already in the last couple of years, we were able to add some new business into our. portfolio, also from a cyber perspective.. Continental Europe was another strong area of growth. Here we can report 15% growth,. the main contributor was our subsidiary E+ S Re, which as you know, is writing our German. business. So E+ S Re could maintain and build its leading position in the German. reinsurance market. There were particular growth opportunities in Germany coming from. the property side. Here, we can certainly observe that after the last couple of difficult. years for the German commercial fire business, the market is starting to re-underwrite. and in part significant re-underwrite their portfolios. So we would be able to take. advantage of this under -- re-underwriting activity with some selected clients.. Another driver for the growth in Continental Europe was, again, Solvency II driven. And. most notably, we could see this development in Italy, where Italy standalone we could. grow our portfolio by 50%. But we also had other spots in Europe, like, for example,. Netherlands, where we did see some additional demand. So overall, a strong picture in. Continental Europe, with certainly the bulk of the growth coming from Germany. And. overall, a 15% growth year-on-year.. The Marine renewals was very mixed. On the Marine side, we had a couple of significant. losses, most notably, a major fire in a German shipyard. And also a Marine loss is coming. out of Japan, following Typhoon Jebi. And -- so the market was repricing the business. after those losses. But it did not so in a very consistent manner. This led us to. deemphasize some programs and grow with other clients, where the price increases. were a little more meaningful. And in addition, we have to report a slightly shrinking client. base. You may have followed that particularly in the loan market, there were quite a. number of Marine portfolios, either on the (haul) or on the cargo side were closed down. or significantly re-underwritten by our ceding companies. This is, of course, leading to a. lesser demand for reinsurance and at times, even no demand for reinsurance any longer. because those clients do no longer write Marine portfolios. And what we could also see. was, clients that have come through merger and acquisition activity had an increased risk. appetite for their Marine exposure so, therefore, also slightly reduced demand for Marine. reinsurance, particularly, from an appetite of loss point of view. So overall, a very mixed. renewal with strong rate increase but at the same time, a slightly falling volume with minus. 7.7%.. On the aviation side, we are seeing strong signals that the market on the original side is. stabilizing. In parts, we even see significant rate increases, particularly, in the field of. general aviation. And -- but we all have to remember that the rates are coming from a. relatively low level with the years falling for many, many years. And even decades coming. from the high in 2002 after World Trade Center. So whilst, we are positive that now with. the rates improvement of 1.8%, the market is slightly stronger from a technical point of. view. We do still not see as an opportunity to start building our aviation portfolio in a. meaningful manner again. And that is the reason why the volume is more or less stable. with only EUR 1 million of additional premium yet to report.. Credit, surety and political risk, another area where, in 2018, we have seen a frequency of. loss activity. As you can see here, this was taken into account when pricing the renewals.. So the price development with a positive 3.5% was stronger than on average. This. certainly helped us to renew our existing portfolio, which we have done very successfully,. sometimes even with increased shares with some of our clients. And we have also been. able to develop a few new opportunities so, overall, good repricing and solid underlying. growth with almost 7% to now almost EUR 800 million of premium in this basket.. On the U.K. loan market and direct portfolio, we had a more stable renewal, most lines of. business renewed basically flat or only slight improvements in case of clients having. losses. We saw a little bit of pricing pressure on individual Motor XL of lost programs. You. will remember that this part of our portfolio was significantly repriced at last year's. renewal, following the sharp reduction in the ogden rate in 2017. So therefore, the. pressure on some of the programs was coming from a strong base, from a rateenvironment point of view. Nonetheless, we managed to renew most of the portfolio on. an as before basis, also on the motor side and the pressure created a little bit from the. anticipation that there will be, at least, a limited swing back in the ogden rate table in the. calendar year 2019, where the current assumption is that we will see the ogden rates. table move again, either in Q2 or Q3 in the calendar year 2019. The extent of that,. certainly, is not known by us. But the market consensus is that the ogden rate will be at. least 0% rather than the minus 0.75%. And maybe even swinging a little bit into the. positive territory, which, of course, will mean that we would have a significant reevaluation. of our motor XL of loss claims reserves. And we have not taken that into account at yearend because this was only an anticipation, this is not a done deal yet.. Otherwise, there was no particular opportunities in the U.K., in loan market portfolio. So. we, basically, renewed our existing book of business. And as you can see, the growth in. the volume is more or less in parallel in the -- with the growth in the pricing of 1.5%. So this. is one of the more stable portfolio.. Worldwide treaty, on the other hand, saw a very significant growth almost 29%. Here, we. have a variety of factors supporting this growth. First and foremost, we see a lot of. positive underlying growth trends in almost all countries in our clients' portfolios, which, of. course, means that even if we only keep our existing shares, our portfolio is growing. organically with our clients. But the bulk of the growth actually came from individual. opportunities we had in a few territories. The most prominent for China, where we could,. again, see more Solvency-driven demand coming out of China. But we've also managed. to improve our positioning with a limited number of selected clients so they were willing. to offer us more significant shares on their existing programs, which by far was the most. prominent driver behind our growth in China.. We could, also, see some positive rate increases in some of the territories. For example,. in Australia and New Zealand, despite the fact that the bulk of the renewal in Australia will. -- only happen at 1st of July, some businesses already renewing at 1st of January. And we. had -- certainly had support from rate increases on that side.. We also had selected opportunities in countries like Japan and in Korea, all on the non-cat. driven side. So from that perspective, there was no Jebi effect in the Japanese. opportunities. I'm talking about, they were more coming from the non-cat property or. from the motor side.. And last but not least, I also wanted to mention that our Caribbean business has been. flat, which certainly was a good development following the significant repricing of the. Caribbean business in the 2018 renewals. And the lack of losses in the Caribbean in 2018.. There certainly was pressure from clients to reduce rates. But the market on the. reinsurance side, overall, resisted that pressure and was able to renew the business flat.. Overall, a very pleasing development in our worldwide portfolio. Strong additional. demand and 29%, despite a more or less flat rating environment.. Last but not least, I will talk about our catastrophe XL of loss portfolio. Here, you can see. another area of significant growth with 32%. The price developments was positive with. 3% increases. We have seen growth both in the U.S. but also outside of the U.S.. And the. main driver really was our support with those clients where we have seen growth on the. non-catastrophe business over the last couple of years. And with our slightly increased. NatCat risk appetite, some of those non-cat growth opportunities we have realized over. time, now needed support from the catastrophe side as well. As Ulrich said, we are still. significantly underweight on the cat side but, of course, many clients are also in a position. where they want to balance their cat and non-cat sessions with the reinsurer. So we saw. opportunities on that side and in combination with our slightly increased risk appetite, this. lead to a significant growth of 32%.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, Sven. And I will continue with the overview, basically summing up what. Sven just said, You can see that on the premium side, most arrows are upwards, none of. them is downwards, there are few sideways. So that calls for an increased premium. income. Also, the profitability overall acceptable. So we expect to generate sufficient. profitability to cover the cost of capital. And maybe even a little bit more, that's of course,. on the basis as the large losses remain in the budget.. You can also see that the areas that we are nonreporting on like facultative and structured. reinsurance and ILS, are rather flat, that's particularly, also true from ILS. But of course,. there's always the opportunity to write some more business throughout the year.. Certainly, all major renewals net 1/1 have been renewed. And there's not really a loss in. income from that point of view. Actually ILS is, of course, much smaller than the structured. reinsurance from a premium point of view. But that has actually grown quite significantly in. -- at 1/1. So overall, I mean, rather acceptable picture, I would say.. That leads me to the 2019 guidance. We're expecting single-digit premium growth. I think,. the renewal season at 1/1 is a good basis for that. We also expect some growth on the life. and health side. But that would also be single digit rather than double digit. Of course, we. will lose some of premium income due to the recaptures of some of our U.S. mortality. business. But there's also new business opportunities that will make up for that and a little. bit more.. Return on investment from asset under management, we expect at least 2.8%. Here it. has to be said that due to the increased interest rates in the U.S. dollar territories as well. as some increased spreads on the corporate bonds, certainly on the fixed income sides,. the valuation reserve have decreased. Therefore, realized gains from fixed income are. somewhat less slightly. And therefore, the 2.8% is a little bit less than what I will report to. you on 2018.. But still, I mean, it is in line with the absolute return that we have seen in the last five years.. And is fully supportive of our group net income guidance of -- in the region of EUR 1.1. billion. Here, on the P&C side, we assume rather flat development of the profitability. compared to last year. This higher profit-- significantly higher profitability on the life and. health side that, overall, should allow us to, hopefully, comfortably achieve the EUR 1.1. billion, of course, on the basis that the large losses are not significantly above the large. loss budget and the -- there's no dislocation in the capital market.. Dividend policy will be rather stable. I mean, the solvency ratio is still well above our. limited threshold. Therefore, I mean, all things being equal and, I mean, if the result. actually transpire as guided, we will probably be able to pay a special dividend again. And. I -- that mean that we will be able to support our growth even with dividend somewhat. higher than 45% of the net profit of the group.. We also changed a little bit, the target metrics. I mean, of course, return on investment is. pretty much housekeeping because that's based on a bottom-up plan and, therefore, it. really depends on the capital market environment. I mean, we have reduced our exposure. to credit a little bit. And have gone to better qualities because to some extent, we could. because of high interest rates in the U.S.. The remainder is largely unchanged. We have also changed, which is probably quite. remarkable on the combined ratio, we increased that from equal or better than 96% to. equal or better than 97%. The reason is twofold, certainly, the proportion of the structured. reinsurance, which have higher combined ratios will be more notable, particularly, on an. earned-premium basis in 2019. It takes that into account, also what we call the maximum. tolerable combined ratio, which is a combined ratio where we earn our cost of capital.. And have also increased a bit due to, I mean, increased interest-rates' risk. So-called risk. for interest rates in the U.S. dollars and some other territories. And therefore, also, we. increased the target combined ratio in line with that. I mean, this target combined ratio, all. things being equal, should still allow us to generate, for the entire group, a return on. equity well above our minimum target, say, in the region, say, 11% to 13%.. That's for the target metrics. And then I would come to the 2018 year, in line with the. based on the current book closing activities, which of course, are still ongoing, particularly. with regards to our auditors that are still looking at the books. And of course, the. supervisory board has not been involved as yet. But nonetheless, these figures are, I. mean, have certainly a higher stability than the figures mentioned, say, at the end of 2017.. So we expect the premium to grow by 11% currency adjusted, 7.7% in real figures due to. currency movements. And that is in line with our previous guidance and even slightly. better than our previous guidance to EUR 19 billion.. Asset under management rather satisfying 3.2%., in particular ordinary investment income. as compared to last year, partly to do with, I mean, continued a very positive returns from. our real estate book as well as our book of alternative investments.. Group net income, we expect around EUR 1.050 billion, which is above EUR 1 billion as you. can, see. And I will also be giving you the split: 38% -- sorry, 83%, property, casualty; 17%,. Life &; Health reinsurance. Of course, if you add the business group numbers, they will be. a little bit higher than EUR 1.050 billion. But then you have a negative number from the. column of consolidation. And that has been distributed to the business groups in the split.. Overall, I mean, a little bit better on the life and health side, maybe, than expected. Yes.. We have the significant burden of recaptures in excess of $300 million. Otherwise, we. had good underlying performance of our life and health business. And we also had some. relief of some expense reserves, which we could no longer hold, they were in respect of. collateral costs for our U.S. XXX business. But following the restructuring and the. aftermath of the U.S. tax reforms, there are simply no collateral cost on the business in. question. And therefore, the reserve on future collateral cost had to be released, which. means that the overall extraordinary burden on the life and health side was just over USD. 200 million.. P&C, we had pretty heavy large loss burden in the Fourth Quarter. So overall, the large. losses came in just slightly above the large loss budget of EUR 825 million. And taking that. into account, we are not that unhappy with the overall performance of our large -- of our. property, casualty business.. I mean, large losses, the 2 largest single losses that we have was the typhoon Jibe with. about EUR 135 million. And the campfire is around EUR 130 million, that's all net after a. concession. If you take all the wildfires together in the U.S., that includes then the Woolsey. fire. And we also have the car fire earlier in the year, if you put it all together, it's around. EUR 200 million from wildfires. So quite significant burden from those events.. Dividend payout, at least EUR 5, we will report more in detail, I think on the 7th of March,. where we will give you all the insights and all the figures. This is just the first update of the. guidance for 2018.. With that, we look forward to your questions, ending the presentation. Thank you.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of James Shuck from. Citigroup.. James Austin Shuck. I had 3 questions from my side, please. Firstly, just on the raised guidance for the. combined ratio from 96% to 97 %, I think you mentioned that the max tolerable combined. structured and tailored transactions. So I guess, if I look at the guidance you gave last year. that was 96% that was stable year-on-year, I would've thought that both of the -- those. influencing factors would have be much bigger last year. You grew 53% in structured. products and interest rates were actually higher at year-end, year-on-year. And yet you're. able to keep it stable. If you can just shed a bit more light on why you're not able to keep. that stable, despite the 1-point-or-so increase in pricing? Why is it this year that you're. seeing that upward pressure earned through?. Secondly, could you just spent a little bit more time on the retro point, I think you. mentioned that there's reduced availability of retro, had none impact on your pricing, not. too sure why that would be, where in the -- retro pricing is up 20% to 40% or so. So just. keen to know why that has no impact on for you?. Then, finally, the 2018 profit number EUR 1.0 billion, obviously is a number of moving parts. and that, you mentioned the release of the collateralized cost is also the recaptured. charges, large losses, et cetera, what's the normalized level of that EUR 1.0 billion for. 2018, please? It's just interesting to see that in a context of what you're expecting for the. EUR 1.1 billion for 2019?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you for those questions. I mean, on the combined ratio, of course, I mean, the. interest rates were increasing throughout 2018. So I mean, there were a little bit lower at. the end of 2017. But I mean, we just tried to align the combined ratio targets really with. the CRE target. And as we could tolerate a higher combined ratio, coupled with the fact. that there's some pressure from the structured reinsurance, we thought we should. increase it. Also, I mean, to give us some flexibility regarding our loss reserving,. considering that even with 97%, we would expect to have a very acceptable -- I mean, a. very acceptable ROE. Of course, I mean, if this business develops more favorable, we. would not hesitate to also show an improved combined ratio to the target of 97%.. Retro pricing, yes, you -- lastly, if you -- our main retro vehicles is our K transactions, which. Fourth Quarter losses. Our vertical hold account still shows a very positive credit balance. to our retrocessionaires. And that means that we could keep the price quite stable. And. But we were able to just to bring it home at more or less the same prices. Then, we have. that had 2 total losses in a row. And of course, I mean, there is a reaction to losses on. losses just in -- our cat exposure within the risk appetite.. I mean, normalized 2018, if you take out the special effect from the life and health, to the. tune of a little bit more than $200 million. Also, take into account that we, definitely, did. not increase the confidence level of our loss reserves in 2018, which we normally like to. do a little bit. I would say, the normalized figure would be, probably, a little bit more than. EUR 1.050 billion, probably, a little bit closer to the EUR 1.1 billion. But not much more than. that so in line with our policy of book closing, I mean, I would say, around EUR 1.1 billion, it. would be something without special effects, we would comfortably expect to achieve. and, hence, that's also the basis for the guidance into 2019.. James Austin Shuck. That's very helpful. Just a quick one on the retro side of things, again. So you mentioned. you renewed in October so, I mean, when it comes to thinking about the outlook for the. combined ratio, 97%, in 2019, if we were to think about pressures on that going into 2020,. then presumably, your retro costs will be much higher and there'll be a negative margin. impact on 2020, is that right?. Ulrich Wallin. Well we wouldn't mind if our retro costs are increasing because we would assume that we. would, then, also see increases in our reinsurance business. And that would, of course,. then allow us to keep a larger part of our cat writings on a net basis. So the only thing that. would be a difficulty for us, if you see a dislocation or -- I mean, these retro costs are not. moving in turn with this reinsurance cost. But I mean, we haven't seen it really at 1/1 this. that we can react accordingly.. But we always, of course, can either scale back our writings a bit, or alternatively give a. higher net on the cap should be rate warrant that. So that does not mean that we will not. yet give enough of our continuity to our retro partners, we will always do that.. Sven Althoff. But if I may add on the early October renewal Ulrich was talking about. There is no price. pressure going into 2020 because there's collateralized quarter share. So the pricing of. this is following our pricing. And we see it on a quarter-share basis, there's no time delay. in our retrocessionaires as repricing that transaction.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of about Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. So my main question was on the 97%. But just if can follow-up. So the -- I mean, the fact. that the structure business is growing -- is not new. And we've discussed about the 60. bps to 1 point of effect on the combined ratio. So how should we interpret this 97%?. Should we interpret that the structured book is going to stay longer in your portfolio? And. keep growing more than you imagined in the past? Or how would you -- how should we. interpret this guidance in the light of that? And I ask because the premium guidance, sort. of, for 2019 is not really changed on that basis. So that is really my main question. I mean,. also, I would like to understand this guidance being conservative also on combined ratio.. Is it that we are building in a lot of conservatism now in that 2019? Because it was -- EUR 1.1. billion already could have had some upside, consensus as looking EUR 1.2 billion. But now. even the 97%, you said, you wouldn't hesitate to deliver better than that. So if you could. just comment a bit more about the conservative nature of the guidance, it will be very. helpful for us.. Ulrich Wallin. You -- thank you, Vinat, for that. Of course, I mean, the 97% on the overall book including. structures means still below 96% on the traditional P&C reinsurance. And of course, we. could have already increased the combined ratio guidance last year when structured was. actually growing quite remarkable. But we only did it this year. We looked at it really. And. really were asking ourselves, do we really need 96% in order to achieve our other profit. targets? And the answer to that was, not really. I mean, 97% would be more than sufficient. to do that. Also, takes into account that we are expecting, of course, a more -significantly, improved results from our life and health business, which we said, of course,. then would mean that there was a pressure on the technical result on the P&C business. would, of course, be not quite as high. And taking all that into account, we thought that we. should do the adjustment on the combined ratio now, that is not saying that we are. compromising on our Re target. So I mean, we are little bit -- I would say, overall situation. for 2019 is a little bit more comfortable, I would say, than 2018 because 2018 we had, of. course, all the recaptured charges. We were quite fortunate that we had a better-thanexpected loss experience from our U.S. life and health business, which alleviated the. problem. And for the future years, we are of course, quite fortunate that the problem is a. lot smaller anyhow because of all the recapture. So there's less pressure in 2019 than. there is in 2017. But the guidance basically takes into account that we would like to deliver. the message that 2019 may be better than 2018. And that we expect for 2019 to achieve. our targets particularly when it comes to the Re.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Paris Hadjiantonis from CrÃ©dit Suisse.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Two questions. The first one would be on the reserve buffers. I think, earlier you have. alluded to the fact that you have not really increased the redundant reserves this year or. the past year in 2018. Did you actually reduce them? So given the level of large losses,. given the recaptures that you've seen on the Life Re side, where you required to, actually,. release some of the EUR 1.8 billion of reserves that you had?. Then, on the specialty lines, since Sven's on the call, pricing seems to be quite good,. probably better than the rest of your portfolio. But volume doesn't seem to follow. through. You have explained the loyalty impact. But is there anything more than that? Is -- I. think you were discussing M&A as well. So if you could actually give us some better. guidance of what exactly you are seeing in the specialty market? It would be, certainly,. very useful.. Ulrich Wallin. the reserve buffers, I mean, I would say the calculations haven't been finished as yet. We. will, of course, advise that on our Investor Day again. But the way it looks now, I would say. basis of the recapture that's also on the basis of the large losses just slightly above the. large-loss budget. That's also why I said, I mean, the underlying, kind of, normalized result,. I mean, is more like EUR 1.1 billion in 2018. And not, say, EUR 1.25 billion, which you would. end up if you just add, I mean, the one-off effect from the life and health side to the. current results or maybe EUR 1.2 billion you run there. So a difference, you would probably. have to say. But most likely have come out of the reserves buffers. They, however,. continue to be quite comfortable, I would say. But also that it's a little bit of the basis for. giving a guidance for next year, which some of you might think is a little bit conservative.. On specialities, Sven, I will hand over to you.. Sven Althoff. Yes, I mean, I tried to explain on the marine side that this was a very mixed renewal. We. were relatively pleased with the increase in the pricing that we could achieve overall. And. this is the area where, at the same time, we have reduced our volumes. This -- the. reduction in volume really is to do with the lesser demand, either from existing clients. because they had to re-underwrite their own portfolios. And at times, they are very. significantly re-underwriting those portfolios and at least one significant M&A transaction,. where after the restructuring of the combined entity from that development alone, we. lost a low 2 double-digit premium figure from this M&A situation.. So I would not be negative about the medium to long-term trend on the marine side. I. think after the re-underwriting efforts, the client portfolio would turn into stronger. portfolios again. And they will eventually grow again. So maybe, we only talk about the. time lag when our volume is responding positively again on the marine side. And so from. that point of view, I wouldn't read too much into the dip at 1/1.. And there is positive development already on the horizon. You may have read in the trade. press that we were able to continue or even increase our private placement on the. reinsurance for the International Group of P&I Associations. That is in the public domain so. that I can talk about that. This is not included into the numbers here because we're talking. about 1/1 business. And that development will happen a little later in the year because the. renewal date is later than 1st of January.. I think on the aviation side, I talk about, yes, positive rate development but from a very,. very low base. So this would be a line of business where, with a little more positive rate. development, we can certainly grow our portfolio again. I mean, some of you may. remember that at its peak, we almost had EUR 1 billion of aviation income. This is now. down to a much, much lower number. I'm not saying it will ever be EUR 1 billion again. But. there's certainly significant scope to continue or to rebuild our aviation portfolio. But we. need a certain level of technical pricing for that.. And last but not least, the credit and surety and political risk portfolio, I mean, this is one. area, which has a, I guess, reacted like you could expect, good underlying rate. development but also good underlying growth. This portfolio has grown consistently in. the medium to high single-digit figures for the last 7 or eight years. So from that. perspective, I think you were more interested in the mixed message on the marine side. then this more stable development on the credit and surety side.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Morris from JPMorgan.. Edward Morris. Three questions from me, please. Firstly, just coming back to this premium guidance for. FY '19, single digit. Just trying to understand if there's one area where you're expecting. this year. You seem to be talking about further growth in structured and also on life and. health. Can you just help us as to why we get back to single-digit growth overall? The. second is on your comments on pricing as we go through the year. Obviously, we have 1/4. and 1/6, 1/7 renewals to come, which probably have a higher proportion of loss-affected. contracts. Can you just tell us what your assumptions are for pricing going forward? Then. have been no change in the market for changes relating to global warming, whether the. exposure has changed. Now I'm just wondering if your own increase in the NatCat budget. takes into account that. You seem to be suggesting it's actually just due to business. growth. So I wonder if you can just comment whether you think the exposure is changing.. Ulrich Wallin. If I start with the last question, of course, with after two years of alleviated NatCat losses,. there's a tendency that you think, well, that might be a trend and you will see more in. future of that. We were in a similar situation at the beginning of 2006, then we had the. hurricanes in 2004 and 2005. And certainly talking about the near-term probability as. opposed to the long-term probability. I mean, I think, there is certainly clear possibility that. you would see a continued gradual growth of the cat losses due to global warming,. particularly when it comes to flood losses and there may be drought losses. That has not. taken into account -- that has only taken into account our increased large loss budget to. the extent it's included in the NatCat model. Because I mean, the budget on the NatCat. side is really the result of the expected losses calculated in accordance with this model. that we use. And so to the extent that we have take into account higher potential for. losses then than, let's say, in otherwise, it's not I would say -- overall, it's based on the. status quo. And so it's really driven by more business.. I mean, that's one of the reasons why we are still reasonably cautious on our cat writings. because we think it has suited us fine to be underweight on cat loss 10 years because it. reduce the volatility of our results. And we're currently not really enthusiastic on the cat. business to increase our net exposure significantly.. Premium guidance, single digit, well, I mean, we probably, as I said, expect some slower. growth on our life and health business as a major part of our business. It has to do with. the premium that we will not be having as a result of the recaptures. Then the life and. health growth will also depend on a few of the larger transactions that we're currently. working on that are coming to fruition or not. Overall, I would say, we have nice growth on. the U.S. financial solutions business on the life and health side. But that will not be visible in. the top line, only in the bottom line. And to grow in China on life and health. But if you take. it all together, we think life and health will probably be lower single digits. Then if you put it. all together, we think we will be in the single-digit bracket. If it ends up to be double digit, I. mean, we will not stop writing in order to keep it in the single-digit range. And on the. midterm pricing, would hand over to Sven, again.. Sven Althoff. Well our base assumption on the midterm pricing was that we have to expect a stable. market environment. So basically flat on the business that has not seen any losses. On the. business with losses. And I mentioned a few of the territories, we certainly expect that. things will be different. And that we will see strong rate increase, depending on the. individual client, depending on the individual size of the loss. At times, we will talk on. those programs, with those losses at high single-digit rate increases or meaningful. double-digit rate increases if programs were more or less totaled or at least significantly. impacted. But the base assumption for the remainder of underwriting year 2019 is very. much like we have shown you today, that it's going to stay a flat environment for those. territories that have not seen any losses, which of course, is the bulk of the business.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research.. Andrew James Ritchie. Just a few quick questions. First of all, could you just clarify how you talk -- when you think. about price on quota share as a proportional business, how are you calculating the price?. Is that purely a movement in ceding commission? Or is that also reflecting the original. underlying market? And is there any risk there on the -- an offset between the original. underlying market pricing and some claims trends? Just clarify how you calculate the price. effect on proportional business. Second question, just on the retro -- your retro. arrangements. I think the implication is that you renewed them with the same structure as. in the K-quota share on the cat exposure business, the whole account protection in the. aggregate. Is that true? Or is there any slight change in terms of your own retentions?. And I guess, finally, I suppose -- I'm not sure, maybe you sort thought you have answered. this already. What is the risk we get disappointed again with the renewals over the rest of. the year? I suppose on driving that, do you see scope for the ILS market in particular to. get its act back together once you've got over the trauma of ILS losses we suffered in the. '17 and '18 underwriting years? Do you see some risk as that gets back together,. particularly by the midyear?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, as far as the last question on the ILS market, it of course, will depend on the. loss development this year. But I think midyear is probably a bit early. I mean, I think if you. suddenly are talking, say, 20% to 30% cat price rise at midyear, then it's very likely that. you will see the ILS market coming back in order to make sure that the rate increases are. not quite so high. But outside that, I think for remainder of the year, I would assume that. the ILS market will be relatively stable and will probably be looking for some higher prices.. Price on the pro rata business is calculated from our rating models. Out of the rating. models, we calculate -- we expect the profitability based on commissions, profit. commissions, original price movement, market movement relative to the cost of capital.. And that's the basis for calculating the price changes there. You can see the precision of. our statement there as good as our pricing model. It's not worse. It's not better. It's the. best that we have. So that's where we go about. Changes on the retro structure, again, I. would like to put that to Sven.. Sven Althoff. Yes, Andrew, I mean, there were a few changes, no significant changes when it comes to. the structure of those placements. So on the K side, we placed a little more capacity. On. the whole account retro, we also placed a little more capacity compared to previous. years. Where we have placed a little less was on the large loss -- excess of loss was. always -- already highlighted. This is the area where we have seen price increase so,. therefore, in order to keep that under control, we placed a little less and then changed. the structure a little bit. And in order to stay in line with our risk appetite, we placed more. of those protections where there was no movement in pricing. I hope this answers your. question.. Andrew James Ritchie. So I'm just trying to work out that in a sort of -- I mean, I appreciate you're targeting your. overall cat budget. But I suppose you've got a little less protection in a frequency year. than you would have had?. Ulrich Wallin. That's, I mean, in years, there were -- of course, the K transaction covers frequency quite. well. Of course, I mean, in years like in 2018, where the losses are not sufficient to hit the. load account. Of course, the aggregate cover is extremely helpful. And there we place a. little bit less. So I mean, if you weigh it all up in a year like 2018, probably we would have. collected slightly less than we actually collected in 2018.. Andrew James Ritchie. Okay. And just to clarify, how -- what's the capacity of the K vehicle for 2019?. Sven Althoff. Well on the K portfolio in question, we are placing 44% into the -- with our collateralized. reinsurance. So just under 50%.. Andrew James Ritchie. Sorry, what was the total risk-bearing capacity of K this year? How much capital did you. raise? What's the K vehicle capitalized at? Then, I can -- obviously, I'd put in the premium. as well.. Sven Althoff. Andrew, I have not memorized that. It was slightly up. But we would have to come back to. you.. Andrew James Ritchie. No worries. I will follow up. Cool.. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And our next session comes from the line of Frank Kopfinger from. Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. I have also 2 questions. One is a follow-up to Ed's question on the top line growth. I think. you pointed in life and -- or you gave the explanation for life. However, I would also like to. have your view on how we should bridge your 15% volume growth now on the treaty. business with your 3% to 5% premium growth from the P&C overall. Then secondly, can. you give some indications on what we should expect in respect to remaining charges or. negative effects from your Life Re business in 2019? And I think there is still some. arbitration going on.. Sven Althoff. Well I mean, if you look at the premium, of course, the 15% is on just under 50% of our. P&C business overall. So I mean, the 15% at 1/1 really accounts for 7.5% for the entire year.. Of course, I mean, there will be some further growth, most likely on the midterm. renewals. But as I pointed out, the structured reinsurance and facultative for the time. being is assumed broadly flattish. So that makes it probably, if you put it all together,. maybe reaching on the P&C side 10% or just a little bit above that. Then if you take, say,. 3% to 5% on the life and health side, that creates a double-digit overall growth.. Then further charges on the Life Re, we would still assume that the majority of those are. really done. Of course. So I mean, if we have charges next year, they will certainly be not. be higher than mid-single-digit millions in U.S. dollars. So our overall U.S. life and health. business is expected to be very profitable because we expect very good profitability. from our financial solution business that should be at or even more than $300 million. And. we also expect, I mean, continued solid profitability from our health and special risk. business in the U.S. Non-U. S., we expect an EBIT of north of EUR 200 million.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Haid from Commerzbank.. Michael Hermann Haid. Michael Haid, Commerzbank. Two questions. Also, when you look at the renewals, you. grew strongly North America, you grew strongly in Continental Europe. And you also grew. in Asia. Can you give us some idea how -- where are you particularly happy growing? What. was -- where were more aggressive? Or what made you particularly happy there? Second. question, you mentioned that the InsurTech market newly arrived into reinsurance. Can. you say what role it played, I assume, from the client side?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, okay, if I start with the first question on the growth. I mean, the growth is really with. individual clients. And I would say it's the -- with the largest premium volume, it's really. kind of -- I mean, I hate that word. But you might call it private, private placement, where. we have secured lines at our terms. And that's why we like the business. And I mean, it. happened to be pretty much around the world, I would say. Sven, you want to add. something to that.. Sven Althoff. Well it's just -- I mean, it's really a selected amount of clients. It's very much driven out of. additional demand from those clients. The pricing is acceptable. So we have not changed. our pricing assumptions in that respect. We do make our cost of capital on those. transactions. And the bulk of the growth areas is coming from the short-tail classes. So. mainly property, which certainly we also like because there was a lesser chance mispricing. on the shorter-tail classes. But the main driver was really additional demand from a. selected number of clients. It was certainly not a growth across the entire portfolio in. those territories.. Michael Hermann Haid. So is it -- go ahead.. Ulrich Wallin. Sorry, I was said, if you have another question on the growth, then I would come the. InsurTech after that.. Michael Hermann Haid. Yes. Is it fair to assume that price differentiation becomes even more important nowadays. than, say, 1 or two years ago?. Sven Althoff. Well it certainly helps if you have, across your entire portfolio, the capability to price the. risk and be a lead market. Do we see more price differentiation? It's still only in isolated. circumstances. I mean, the bulk of the business is still placed with the same terms and. conditions with all the participating reinsurers. We see it a little more often than in the. past. But it's still the exception. It is certainly nowhere near the norm yet.. Ulrich Wallin. And of course, if you write the business 100%, you're not quite sure what the price of the. rest of the market would have been. If it would have been a composite placement.. Therefore, we're always a little bit cautious when we talk about pricing on private deals. I. mean, we get the price that we need -- that we think we need to earn the cost of capital.. But of course, if you have at all, I mean, it might have been more expensive than it would. have been in the -- on a core reinsurance basis. You just don't know.. On the InsurTech, I mean, here we have a partner model. I mean, we're not developing a. lot of InsurTech capabilities ourselves. But we work with partners that have an interest to. partner with us. And that has resulted in reinsurance business to some extent where the. InsurTech has a license to be an insurance company. So then we provide them with this. reinsurance capacity and some support regarding products and original pricing.. Sometimes they are just tools providers, like on the life side. I mean, on our Vitality. business. But we also have other areas where, I mean, we have InsurTech that provide. medical, I mean, screening based on wearable devices where they have the technique.. And we help them to create an insurance revenue stream that they, of course, are. reinsuring it. That's pretty much what we have.. We have as I said, created an underwriting department so that, I mean, brokers but also. the InsurTech themselves, have somewhere that takes care of them within Hannover Re.. And as I said that has been quite -- I mean, they were more successful than we expected. it, I must say. I mean, we have more opportunities and created more business than we. actually thought. At the same time, it's still, I mean, it's more a minority of our overall. business, I would say.. Operator. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Paris Hadjiantonis from CrÃ©dit. Suisse.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Couple of follow-ups from me. Firstly, on the cost of capital, I was just wondering if you. could give us an idea of where, for the overall P&C portfolio, this now stands. And how it. has changed year-on-year? Then a clarification on what you've done on the life. reinsurance side with the release of the collateral. Why did you have to do it in the Fourth. Quarter, given that the restructuring of your U.S. business actually happened earlier in the. year? Was it related to close of books at the year-end? Or was it something else?. Ulrich Wallin. Well the cost of capital that we take into account is, of course, the cost of capital on the. economic capital. But we then also look at the ROE target. And so the cost of capital. definitely has to fulfill the ROE target based on interest -- on risk-free interest rate. So this. is the 900 basis points over and above risk free. That's the basis for the calculation.. Then on the cost, I mean, what that really is, I mean, on the XXX and AXXX business that. you write from the U.S., historically, you have to put up a collateral for the so-called. noneconomic reserves, which was the reserves over and above the calculation of the. actuaries. And that's normally done in -- by letter of credit. And that means that, of course,. when you calculate the future expected cash flows, these collateral costs are taken into. account. Through various measures, we have reduced these collateral costs through. captive structure and other things to virtually 0. However, we still kept the reserve for. collateral cost because some of these structures are subject to change. For example, I. mean, the reduced collateral following the convent order that we have for the some of. the U.S. authorities, are subject to our -- for our credit ratings. So if our credit rating would. deteriorate, we would have to put up higher collateral again. Then we would also, of. course, have to take care of that in reserving.. Now with the change in the business, some of the business is now structured through a. captive that we have set up by the name of Sand Lake Re. And with that, there is no need. to put up collateral under any reasonable circumstances. And therefore, we reduced the. reserves that are in relation to that. I mean, why -- I mean, we would have probably done. it early on. But of course, I mean, this was work in progress. I mean, there was a significant. restructure. And of course, there was then a lot of discussions with our auditors as well.. And that was just finalized in time for year-end. And therefore, this release came at year-. end. But it's only a smaller part of the overall cost reserves that we are having obviously. I. mean, it's not the entire cost reserve.. Operator. Our next question is another follow-up question from the line of Vinit Malhotra from. Mediobanca.",20190205_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Guidance_Call_2019-2-5_SD000000002901846468.pdf,2019-02-05
32,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call. presenting our results for the first nine months of 2018. As always, I'm joined by our CFO,. Roland Vogel.. The most significant event that had an influence on our results of the Third Quarter were. the recapture charges from our U.S. legacy mortality business, which was a result of our inforce management actions. This resulted in a one-off pretax IFRS loss of USD 260 million,. equal to EUR 218 million. This is very much in line with our reporting that we issued on the. occasion of our half yearly results. After tax, this negative effect is around EUR 170 million.. Considering that despite that, we generated a group net income of EUR 725 million. This. tells you that the performance of our business otherwise was rather satisfactory. In. particular, this relates to our Life & Health business, though the international business. outside North America as well as the U.S. financial solutions business performed fully in. line or even better than our expectations with the Third Quarter performance here, very. much in line with a favorable performance that we have seen in the first half year of 2018.. Our property and casualty business, on the other hand, felt an increase of frequency of. sizable losses below the threshold of our large loss reporting. And thus, the combined. ratio for the first nine months of 96.8% was slightly above our target.. The return on investment from assets under own management again developed very. favorable with 3.2%, well above our benchmark for 2018 of 2.7%. The top line grew. considerably, with the gross written premium increasing by 16.5%, then adjusted for. foreign exchange rate movements, which reflects the increased demand from our clients. for our reinsurance solutions. The bottom line rose sharply compared to 2017, mainly due. to the fact that in 2017, we had suffered the well-known cat losses. However, the EBIT of. EUR 1.15 billion after nine months as well as the group net income of EUR 725 million came. in at a quite acceptable level. This is underlined by the fact that the annualized return on. equity with 11.5% continues to be well above our minimum target of 900 basis points. excess of risk-free rate.. Despite the fact that the book value per share reduced slightly as a result of dividend. payments and interest rates and spread movements, the solvency ratio remained. comfortably above EUR 252 million (sic) (252%) at the end of the half year. And we expect. to be well above our threshold despite the growth of our business also for the 9-month. period.. The large loss burden of our P&C business absorbed almost the entire large loss budget. during the Third Quarter. However, if you look at the 9-month period, we are still well. below the budget. Therefore, it can be said that the increased large loss activity during. the Third Quarter was well absorbed within our expected values for large losses.. The premium growth of our Life & Health business of 4.8% adjusted for foreign exchange. rate movement is well in line with our target of growth of 3% to 5%. Also the third -- in the. Third Quarter, our business continued to generate a very positive operating cash flow,. which was the basis for the growth of the assets under own management as well as the. gratifying increase of our ordinary investment income.. On this note, I would hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain these numbers in. more detail.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Good morning. And thank you, Uli.. As the nine months result does not include so many one-off effects other than the. recaptures in our Life & Health segment, I will try to keep my comments as brief as. possible.. On the Page #2, we see that the remarkable top line growth of 16.5% adjusted for. currency effect in the first nine months of 2018 is largely driven by our P&C business as we. continue to see ongoing high demand from all clients, especially for structured products.. Net premium earned developed overall in line with the gross premium. The group EBIT. improved significantly, although the individual parts showed a quite mixed picture. P&C. improved remarkably on the basis of a previous year, which was hit hard by the Hurricanes. Harvey, Irma and Maria. On the other hand, L&H is -- or the Life business is impacted by. charges from the recaptures impacting the current year's result negatively to quite some. extent.. Finally, even though the year-to-date 2018 development was very satisfactory, investment. income is down because we could not sell our equity portfolio another time, which had. boosted last year's results by more than EUR 220 million pre; as well as after-tax.. On the -- other income and expenses improved mainly due to positive currency effects. and the increase in net income was less pronounced compared to the rise in EBIT,. reflecting a higher tax rate. This is mainly a reflection of the extraordinary tax burden in. connection with the U.S. tax reform in the First Quarter of 2018 and the nearly tax-free. profits from the liquidation of our equity portfolio in the previous year, as already. mentioned.. Operating cash flow here on the next page continued to be very positive in the first nine. months, increasing by more than 15% compared to the previous years. And for those who. have been following our Investors Days, I would like to remind you of the impact of the. operating cash flow on the assets under own management as well as the investment. income going forward, which I was trying to make transparent at that occasion.. Looking at the development of our investments and (net) effect from currency translation. and the change in valuation reserve was minus EUR 200 million. Here, the currency. adjustments -- the positive currency adjustments of EUR 500 million were more than. offset by the decrease in valuation reserves due to the rising interest rates and spread. increases, which produced a negative effect of around EUR 700 million. In spite of this and. driven by the positive cash flow, assets under own management increased by 3.5%.. The capital position on the next slide is impacted by the same effects. The dividend. payout is fully covered by the profits from the first nine months of 2018 or the potential. dividend or payout. Rising interest rate in the U.S. and spread increases resulted in a. decrease in unrealized gains, which was only partially offset by positive currency effects,. as already mentioned. Therefore, the overall negative development of the OCI led to a. decrease in shareholders' equity of 2.1%. And here on the left-hand side of the slide, the. picture is nearly unchanged. But let me remind you of the remaining high degree of. flexibility in the Tier 2 bucket, which potentially could be utilized whenever necessary.. P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 24% on an FX-adjusted basis. The main. driver of this organic growth continues to be new business written by our structured. reinsurance team. Additionally, a few larger transactions in our traditional business lines. contributed to the development, especially in Australia and China.. Net premium developed in line with gross premium. Again, this gross pattern. demonstrates that we do not have a volume problem at all. And this is the basis to stick to. our purely result-driven underwriting approach and that we should only assume business. which lives up to our profitability targets.. Following a very benign first half year, we have seen a significant increase in large loss. activity in the Third Quarter, exhausting the budget on a stand-alone basis. However, we. still carry forward the unused budget from the first half as part of our IBNR reserves.. The combined ratio of 96.8% is slightly above the full year maximum target of 96%. This. can be partly explained by the strong increase in our structured reinsurance business,. which naturally comes with a higher combined -- or comes with higher combined ratios of. around 98%, 99% due to the lower risk transfer. As part of the structure of those deals,. the commission is also often slightly higher than the rest of the business. Additionally, we. saw an increased frequency of small and midsized losses in the Third Quarter, which. explains the 98.7% in the stand-alone quarter as such. Overall, the underwriting result is. still rather positive in light of the competitive environment. The runoff of loss reserves in. the first nine months was in line with our expectations overall.. Ordinary investment income increased slightly. And other income expenses also improved. mainly because of positive currency effects. The operating profit increased by 67% due to. the high level of cat losses in the previous year.. As mentioned earlier, the increase in the tax ratio is mainly due to the fact that last year's. result benefited from the tax or nearly tax-free disposal of gains and dividends. The. relatively low tax ratio in the Third Quarter is due to a few smaller items adding up to this. positive effect. You might remember that it was exactly the other way around in the. Second Quarter. And therefore, overall, the tax ratio is now in line with expectations yearto-date.. Major losses, on the next slide, were below the expected level and entirely driven by the. very benign first six months of the year. This leaves us with comfortable cushion to absorb. large losses in the Fourth Quarter, including the unused budget carried forward and our. retrocession, which are also nearly fully intact. The large (loss list) is predominantly driven. by the strong storm activity in the Third Quarter both in the Atlantic and the Pacific regions. and particularly in Japan, where a series of typhoons led to widespread destruction and. flooding. The difference between the gross and the net loss illustrates how well our. protection is working. Although, of course, it should be noted that it also includes our. activity in the ILS markets where we are one of the larger players in the collateralized. fronting business. And that also leads to a higher difference in gross and net.. You might ask what we expect from Hurricane Michael. Early in the Fourth Quarter, we. have no concrete calculations available yet. But we would expect Michael to be in the. ballpark of the Florence losses based on the information we have available today.. The next slide shows a little bit of a mixed picture of underwriting profitability by line of. business. Facultative business is affected by large losses. So for instance, also the Ituango. dam in Colombia. Within the U.K. business, we expanded our nonproportional mortal. portfolio, which comes with high initial loss ratio assumptions, well above the 100%. And. marine -- on the other hand, marine aviation credit and surety are significantly below the. MtCR. Most other lines of the portfolio as a whole are close to our target combined ratio.. And on this basis, we would expect to meet our 96% target by the end of this year.. On the Life & Health side, here on Life & Health, the gross written premium increased by. 4.8%, adjusted for currency effects, which is exactly in line with our expectations for the. entire year. The main driver for this development was gross from U.K. longevity business. and the expansion in China.. Uli has already commented on the development in U.S. mortality. And he will most likely. come back to that as part of the outlook. The very favorable development of our mortality. business outside the U.S. and our financial solutions business in the U.S. as well as around. the world continued in the Third Quarter. Our worldwide morbidity business performed. particularly well with significantly improved profitability. And also, the well-discussed U.S.. mortality business came in better, or to be correct, less negative than expected.. Nevertheless, these positive developments were overshadowed by the recapture effect. we had to reflect in Q3 with an amount of EUR 218 million. Ordinary investment income. increased realized gains. And losses were significantly lower compared to last year's,. partly driven by the increase in interest rates in the U.S. Consequently, net investment. income from assets under own management came down to EUR 232 million. As already. mentioned, we had a one-off effect of about EUR 22 million from the tax reform in Q1. 2018. Apart from this, the tax ratio is also somewhat distorted by the quarterly loss in Q3.. Looking at the investments. The development in the first nine months of 2018 was very. satisfactory, with the investment income remarkably above our return expectations for the. full year. The contribution from private equity and in real estate continued to be quite. attractive. But we've also seen an increase in ordinary income on our fixed income. portfolio.. As presented at our Investor Days, some 3 weeks ago, the reinvestment yields for the. U.S. dollar is currently higher than the maturing yields by quite a margin. And we are. therefore starting to see slightly the benefits of the rising U.S. interest rates in our. numbers and especially the ordinary income.. Realized gains and losses decreased compared to last year, particularly to the sale of our. equity portfolio in 2017. Impairments, depreciations still consist mainly of regular. depreciation for real estate.. Overall, the ROI of 3.3%, if we exclude the effect from our ModCo derivative, which was. minus EUR 4 million after the nine months, the 3.3% is clearly above the full year target.. That means that we will probably see an ROI figure potentially with a 3% also by the end. of the year. But 6 weeks before the end of the year, it didn't make sense to change our. guidance here.. As a result of increased interest rates and widened spreads evaluation, reserves. decreased compared to the year-end 2017. As mentioned at previous occasions, we do. appreciate the slowly growing reinvestment yields and their impact on the ordinary. income. But we also have to get used to a smaller contribution from realized gains.. The next slide shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes contributed to. the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. In the course of our. portfolio reshuffling, we have reduced our share of high-risk corporates and now -- and. are now investing on a more diversified basis across the rating spectrum again. And we. are also expanding into emerging markets a little bit. Additionally, we have modified the. nature of our government bond holdings and expanded our portfolio instruments with. inflation that coupons and redemption amounts to counteract potentially rising inflation. risks, especially for our P&C reserves.. The left-hand side illustrates the favorable performance of our private equity and the real. estate portfolio. The contribution from the govies is increasing compared to previous. periods, driven by a mix of higher volumes and increasing interest rates, especially in the. U.S., as already mentioned more than once.. I think this concludes my remarks. And as usual, I leave the target matrix and the outlook. to you, Uli.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland.. Well the target matrix shows most of the targets actually ticked, which demonstrates that. the business performed largely in line with our target. It's fair to say that the earnings. growth is, of course, inflated due to the underperformance of, at the same time in 2017. due to the well-known hurricane losses of last year. But we didn't have to tick it on the. combined ratio, which shows actually what's already mentioned, quite a higher frequency. of losses outside the large losses. But as Roland said, we expect that to come back into. the target level by year-end. Also, I mean, of course, the EBIT growth on Life & Health. would have been there without the recapture. But having the recapture, of course, it's not. there.. That leaves me -- this comes -- we now come to the guidance for the current year, which. we left unchanged from our previous reporting. And I would like to confirm, in particular,. our net income guidance of more than EUR 1 billion, which we expect to achieve, including. the burdens that we have seen from the Third Quarter and expecting for the first -- Fourth. Quarter from our U.S. mortality business due to the already-mentioned recapture. We. have much better clarity of the position on this topic now. And we are expecting a further. negative one-off effect in the Fourth Quarter in the region of EUR 100 million. This burden. should be absorbed by the underlying profitability of the rest of our Life & Health business. so that we do not expect any significant negative result from our Life & Health business. during the Fourth Quarter. As always, our net income guidance is subject to no major. distortions in the capital markets and on the basis that the major losses remains in the. large loss budget. And as the same conditions, we would expect that the dividend payout. should be at least at the level of the previous year of EUR 5 per share.. This then brings me to the development of our P&C business this year. Overall, we. expecting good growth of the premium. That continues on from the first nine months.. And on the profitability, we expect that, overall, we will earn the cost of capital margin. Of. course, here, the very-well diversified portfolio helps to absorb underperforming lines of. business, like for example U.K. and Ireland and facultative business this year with other. lines of business that are in line or outperforming the business, such as for example. credit, surety and marine. So despite the continued very competitive market in the P&C. side, we still feel that we are in the position to deliver profitability in line with our target.. Coming to the Life & Health business. We will continue to see, as we have seen in the first. nine months, excellent profitability from our financial solutions business. This is for the. most part a U.S. business. But also our non-U. S. financial solutions business is very. profitable.. Longevity, we see a rather stable development, both bottom and top line. This business is. largely centered on the U.K. business for the time being. But we are working on a number. of very promising opportunities outside the U.K., particularly in countries like Australia,. Canada and -- but also Asia. However, the premium income and profits from those. initiatives would probably only come to fruition in the year 2019 and onwards.. Mortality is negative due to the already many times mentioned recaptured-only U.S.. mortality business. It's quite interesting to note that our mortality business outside North. America actually have shown -- I mean, an EBIT margin north of 7%. That has been for. quite some while. And it's also been true for the first nine months. And we also expect. that for the entire year.. On the morbidity business, we have seen clear improvements, both bottom and top line.. So we expect that business will at least earn the cost of capital. However, overall, due to. the loss on -- expected loss on the mortality business, the profitability on our Life & Health. business will be somewhat short of the necessary margin to serve as the cost of capital.. This brings me to the guidance for next year. The guidance for next year, we expect. further growth of our premium income, even though not quite at the same range as in. 2018. But well in line with our targets from the target matrix.. Return on investment has been calculated on a bottom-up basis of 2.8%. This was a bit. more than our targets that we had for 2018 and as a result, that just under 50% of our. assets under management are denominated in US dollars. So the ordinary income should. benefit from the significant rise in the interest rates for U.S. dollar investment.. The net income guidance of -- in the region of EUR 1.1 billion is supposed to signal that the. profitability in 2019 will increase as compared to 2018. Because in 2018, of course, the net. income guidance is centering at around a number of EUR 1 billion. Of course, EUR 1.1 billion. is not a point estimate here. It leaves room more ups and down, I would say, from the EUR. 1.1 billion. It takes into account that our Life & Health business is expected to be. significantly more profitable in 2019 than it has been in 2018. For our P&C business, the. combined ratio target that we have of 96% or better (would) still hold true for our. expectations and is still the basis for our guidance of 2019. And therefore we feel quite. comfortable with the 1.1 -- with the around EUR 1.1 billion guidance.. Dividend payout ratio is unchanged here. However, this -- the growing net income, we. most likely will be in the position to consider an increase in the ordinary dividend which. then most likely will, circumstances allowing, again be boosted by a special dividend.. However, the component of the ordinary dividend should actually increase for 2019. So to. caution you that this is of course all under the same providers that you see in the footnote. of this slide. And of course, I mean, it's relatively (easy) to talk about dividends there for. 2019. But the general policy here remains unchanged.. Then this slide that you see here is actually the same I was showing to you on our recent. Investors Day. It should tell you that also in the medium term, we are expecting that our. business model should be capable to grow our profitability of our business based on. outperforming the market on the P&C reinsurance, growing EBIT, EBIT contribution from. our Life & Health business in 2019. But also beyond. And the investment income, of. course, a little bit held back by the reduced valuation reserves as the result of the. increased interest rates and spreads. But these expectations of growing assets under. management gradually would also see increasing bottom line numbers here.. That would end our presentation. And we would be more than happy to answer your. questions. Thank you very much.. Questions And Answers. Operator. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of William Hawkins from. KBW.. William Hawkins. Uli, in your closing remarks, you just slightly touched on this. But could you be little bit. clearer about how you view the walk from 2018 to 2019 guidance? I mean, it strikes me. that the non-recurrence of the U.S. mortality charges alone should be adding something. like EUR 250 million to next year's performance. Then you've got business growth and. high yields and hopefully an unchanged combined ratio, all of which to me should be. pointing to momentum allowing for a correction of something like EUR 400 million or so.. So I appreciate what you say about conservatism and the rest of it. But could you just be a. little bit clearer? Because to me, EUR 1.1 billion does not seem ambitious if you're going to. achieve EUR 1 billion this year. There must be some negatives I'm missing. So that's. question #1. Then I suppose question #2 is very brief again. You did allude to this. But just. in terms of your commitment to the 96% or better combined ratio, the Slide 17 that you've. repeated from the Investor Day has kind of dropped that number out. And so I'm just. wondering, again, given that you're growing in structured products and the rest of us -and the rest of it, do you want to be pulling back a bit from that 96% or is that still a key. target for you?. Ulrich Wallin. William, well, I mean, the EUR 250 million improvement you are expecting from the Life &. Health is, of course, a pretax number.. William Hawkins. No. It wasn't, sorry. Sorry, Uli, it wasn't. Because your figure originally is EUR 300 million to. EUR 350 million. And so I tried to take some tax off.. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean, we have EUR 155 million EBIT now. We are expecting at least 0 for the Fourth. Quarter on the Life & Health. So if I add EUR 250 million to that, I arrive at EUR 400 million.. That's probably a fair guess, I would say. Then on the 96% combined here, that is still the. target for 2019, which we expect to reach. We think that the quality of our P&C business. would support that. That is also based on our assumptions that the pricing quality of our. business in 2018 would be at least as good as in -- in 2019 would be at least as good (at if. in) 2018. And well, I mean, if the pricing quality is the same as that, considering that the. large losses remained in the somewhat increased large loss budget to EUR 875 million,. we should reach the 96% or better. So that's all there. Of course, I mean, it's early days. for next year. So we, as we did in previous years, are reasonably cautious. This is our. guidance. You should also take into account that this year. So far, we have a significant. outperformance of our benchmark for our investment income, which will probably remain. until -- for the entire year as well. So that would of course signal a drop in investment. income for next year because the target is 2.8%, which is a bottom-up target. So from. that point of view, I would say we feel comfortable with the -- I mean in the region of EUR. 1.1 million (sic) (EUR 1.1 billion). As I said, it's not a point estimate.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Well if I may add one component, Will. I think one of the differences in assumption is here. that you just take out the recaptured charges. We did mention that the mortality business. has been performing better, or I did mention less negative than in the previous years. We. did not assume that for next year already. So we are a little bit more conservative on that. side, which is then -- may also be an explanation for the difference in assumptions.. William Hawkins. Just on that final point, Roland. Is there anything for this year in Life & Health that you. would like to highlight that is explicitly one-off in nature beyond that point you just. Roland Helmut Vogel. Not really. It was -- we had negative surprises in the past. We had a -- which we were. always wondering should we really write that forward and prolong into the future or is it a. -- statistically a one-off this year. It came in better. Just the mortality came in better. We. didn't have so many large losses with higher sums insured. So we appreciate that this was. the case. But we did not assume this to continue next year and the years going forward to. the full extent.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. It's just one of those years where, in Life & Health, nothing went wrong really outside. the recapture. I mean non-U. S., very strong result. I mean financial solutions (U. S.), very. much in line with expectations. That will continue to grow on bottom line next year. And. mortality solutions, I mean, on the old books that we bought from Scottish Re, the. mortality experience was actually quite a bit better than expected and significantly better. than in 2017. We did not assume that, that will also be the same in 2019. So there's quite a. little bit of caution, even though the portfolio has shrunk a lot now there because, I mean,. all the recaptures. And we are currently in the process of evaluating the loss expectations. for the coming years based on this significantly smaller book of business. And -- but that. hasn't been finalized as yet.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Kamran Hossain from RBC.. Kamran Hossain. Two questions. First one is just on, I guess, P&C combined ratio and loss experienced.. Could you -- I mean, a couple of your peers have talked about higher attritional losses in. the quarter. Could you give any comments on that and kind of whether you see this as a. costly blip or something that is around longer term? And the second question, just coming. back to Life. I guess if we net out your (2018) of your EBIT loss, we get to a number which. suggests a higher EBIT than the EUR 400 million, EUR 450 million. Could you talk about. one-offs in this quarter and why we shouldn't take this quarter underlying and then. extrapolate that times 4 for the next few years?. Ulrich Wallin. Well I wouldn't say that there are positive one-offs in this quarter. Just nothing went. wrong. I mean that's also a one-off, I would say. And it is obvious something is happening,. in that the EUR 20 million retention per Life, of course, I mean that could also generate. some volatility. No. I mean, it's no positive one-off. I mean it's just, as I said, nothing went. wrong. Of course, if that would be true throughout the entire -- and almost be the truth. throughout the entire 2018 year. But of course, we would think it's rather optimistic to. hope for the same in 2019. So from that point of view, we're obviously a bit cautious there.. I mean losses, losses on the -- underlying losses on the P&C side, particularly in the Third. Quarter, of course, a lot of industry of higher losses. I mean, we had a refinery in Bavaria. I. mean, there was another refinery loss in the Middle East. There was the bridge in Genoa.. Quite a lot of losses. I mean, marine wasn't pristine either. But -- therefore, I mean, we. clearly saw increasing losses. And you can see it in, I mean, in portfolios of large. commercial business with many of our clients. I mean, they have significant losses as well.. And some of them ended up in our books. I mean, I would still say that it's a quarterly. in 2019 and to come. But it also reminds us very sharply that there is no room for rate. decreases at the coming renewals.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.. Vinit Malhotra. So my questions are, sorry, in the same lines of thought. The -- just moving step-by-step.. So the combined ratio at the 98.6% -- or rather, even if it's to nine months, it's 96.8%. To. move towards the fourth -- I know 4Q stand to be sort of in the (90th) range. But just. could you help us understand, I mean, say, either 3Q or nine months, how much is the. effect of the structured solutions or even the large treaties and then this frequency topic. you just mentioned? Just so that -- trying to understand how this can go back to 96% next. year, please. But that's probably my main question.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Vinit. Well the financial solutions here, I would say, probably just under one. combined ratio, loss point, percentage point. Why should they move back? I mean, on the. -- we have seen quite a lot of business growth also outside the structured reinsurance.. And I mean, therefore, our rather conservative -- I mean, reserving in the initial. underwriting years plays a major role here. I mean, we have, I mean, combined ratios in. the newest underwriting years valid by the 100 just based on our general conservatism. when we set up our loss reserves. And I mean, we're not expecting to grow to the same. magnitude next year. So the latest underwriting (years) that was subject to that rather. significant growth. Certainly on the shorter to midterm lines, we are expecting to show. some positive development on the loss ratios. That's the main reason why we expect that. to come back. I mean, we still -- of course, we try to keep our buffers on the loss. reserves, which we just had shown you at the occasion of our Investors Day to the extent. possible. I mean, you can see that we didn't have to show a spectacular good combined. ratio on the Third Quarter in order to make up for the recapture. So on the U.S. Life &. income, both actually quite favorable.. Vinit Malhotra. one which shows the cost of capital by line. And just by virtue of comparison compared to. gone down in profitability a bit, one notch. And marine seems to have improved. Could. about anyways?. Ulrich Wallin. Well North America is higher than we would like to see it. That is mainly due to property. losses from the hurricanes. And I mean, marine is -- I mean, on the marine side, we are. actually rather conservatively reserved on the old losses, on -- I mean, on additional claims. reserves. And therefore, we have those coming out at times. And that then makes this. spectacular combined ratio. But the volume is not all that large either. I mean, that is. probably be expected for the entire year, even despite the fact that we have losses like. that German shipyard loss, which is also reasonably sizable despite the fact that we are -our retrocession on (sales works) actually particularly good.. Vinit Malhotra. And on these buffers, could you just update us, Uli or Roland, on what is the normalized. sort of normal loss reserve release run rate per annum or per quarter? And is this. changing next year probably? It used to be EUR 50 million a quarter, long ago. But you. updated to EUR 100 million already, I think. And I'm just wondering if it's changing again. next year?. Roland Helmut Vogel. Well this is of course difficult to foresee, what's going to happen next year. If we have. business growth and the redundant reserves grow, then of course also the, what we call. the regular runoff should be growing. We haven't been growing the redundancies over. the last years dramatically. So in that regard -- and I think we updated that when we. discussed the extraordinary EUR 800 million last year, that a regular accepted or. course, then -- and not a certain number because it can be impacted, especially also by a. large contract where you sometimes have movements from commissions into losses and. vice versa. But the EUR 400 million would be the ballpark number per year, which we are. expecting, which we also have been seeing in previous years.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin from UBS.. Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin. Just two -- two for me, please. So firstly, could you talk us through your thinking behind. increasing the cat budget? Is it just that you've grown a lot for this year? I guess I always. thought your cat budget was always quite plentiful. So no great need to increase it. And. secondly, how do you expect percentage of capital to react to the losses through the. Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter so far, if at all?. Ulrich Wallin. Well the increase in the cat budget is just a factor of the actuaries because you calculate. the expected losses on the natural catastrophe side on an annual basis and with an. increase to -- I mean, to increase underlying exposures, which always happen inflationarydriven and also, I mean, some slightly increased aggregates that we have written on the. cat business that just came out with a high expected loss. We also have more premium as. a result of that. That's the reason -- I mean it hasn't grown significantly. And we kept it. stable for number of years. I mean if you just look at the actual experience, you might say,. well, I mean, EUR 825 million is plenty because in most years, we are not hitting that. But. this is just an actuarially calculated number, which we also use for our planning purposes.. That's on the large loss budget, why we increase it, to reflects just increased exposures. and increased premiums as well. The other question, the losses in the Third Quarter and. the Fourth Quarter. What was that due to the market? I think it should allow us to, I mean,. not give away any of the, I mean, rate increases, not large enough but the rate increases. as we got in 2017. And on the contracts that have suffered losses and our negative. territory as a result, I mean, we would expect further rate increases.. Alternative capital, while this is a difficult one to predict, I would say -- I mean the results of. the alternative capital facilities this year have not been brilliant. Of course, it's a mixed. picture. I mean the variety of outcomes from various funds is quite different. But I mean I. would expect that the investors might be a little bit more cautious for 2019 than they have. been for 2018 because some of the expectations on significant rate movements have not. been fulfilled. And I mean, if the investors look at the Guy Carpenter Rate On Line Index,. they would have a very good proxy to -- what to expect.. Operator. And our next question comes from the line of Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs.. Sami Taipalus. Just to ask a question on pricing, actually. I understand your comments regarding the loss. experience this year and obviously why that should (help) support the pricing in the. following year. But if we just look to one-one purely, which I guess is more Europe-focused. and casualty-focused, could you just provide a more specific outlook for just one-one,. what you expect to see there? And also maybe comment a little bit about what you're. seeing in terms of demand for large P&C transactions. Then my second question is on. investment income. It's just not quite clear to me how much of the ordinary investment. income in this year, year-to-date is extraordinary and how much is -- you consider to be. fully ongoing. So it'd be great to have some more detail there, please.. Ulrich Wallin. Well I mean on the pricing, in Europe in particular, I mean, we expect that to be rather. stable because there have been quite a lot of losses in the market. And if you look at the. reportings of the larger reinsurers so far. And look at the combined ratios and compare. that, say, with these reporting sets at the same time in 2016 and in 2015, for argument's. sake, you would see that the combined ratios are remarkably higher now. So that shows. you that there is no room for rate reduction. And also, such as that there are more. programs that are actually in the loss position this year than there have been in previous. years. And that will have an effect on the pricing, I'm pretty sure. Demand for reinsurance. is still, I would say, rising. Particular -- I mean some of the -- of our clients have experienced. significant volatility in their own results. And of course -- particularly on the commercial. lines. And as a result, are quite interested in getting reinsurances in place that uses that. volatility. And as a result, both large and small; to medium-sized transaction, we would. investment, I would, of course, hand over to Roland.. Roland Helmut Vogel. from larger funds, PE funds as well as high-yield funds. There was, I think, one also this. year. But I would not really see that as an extraordinary ordinary income contribution. So in. that regard, I -- again, there was one. But there could be another one also next year again.. So we should really see that as driven by ordinary, ordinary income and nothing special.. No one-offs included in there.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank.. Frank Kopfinger. Actually, I have a follow-up question on Sami's question because I still don't understand. how you get to this 2.8% guidance return on investment for next year. And as after the. first 3 quarters, you had already an ordinary investment yield of 3.3%. And you just said. that this is already the ordinary level. So I still don't see the gap to the 2.8%, which you. have within your guidance. Then secondly, how should we think about the unused major. loss budgets for 2018? Obviously, as of now you have still EUR 460 million unused. There. will be some effects obviously in Q4 and probably to come. But how should we think. about the residual? Are you going to put it into the reserves or are you able to release it. into the result?. Ulrich Wallin. Well on the (lay down), I mean I would say this gives us good confidence that the loss ratio. for the entire year will drop below 96% because that is still there. It's -- also at least, on. the cat side, it's highly unlikely this year that the cat losses will be able to exhaust our. budget because of our retrocessional structure. So I think it's quite, quite likely that we will. end up with unused large loss budget also at the end of the year. But just due to the. structure of our retrocessions. And on the 2.8%, that's far too complicated for me.. Roland?. Roland Helmut Vogel. You're right. We had mentioned the 3.3% as ordinary investment income. But that is, of. course, before any depreciation and any expenses. So in that regard, we have to deduct. already this year, if you look at the publication, some 40 basis points. And that would then. result at 2.8% to 2.9%. And we cannot expect really contributions from disposals going. forward. Yes. We -- our evaluation reserves came back from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 900. billion by the end of the quarter based on what was happening since then. You can. imagine that this number is lower rather than higher today. And the remaining. contributions to the valuation reserves do come from the more illiquid classes like real. estate and private equity and high-yield funds. So in that regard, we just have to expect. that there will be -- and this is the basis of our planning, that there will be no contribution. from realized gains and losses. We might also have to see that disposals and sales of. securities will be still associated with the realization of negative reserves. And from the. bottom-up calculation we did, maturing yields, new investments, the 2.8% is what we. achieve. Could that also be 2.9%? Yes. But again, the contribution from realized gains is. not expected to be as high as in the past. And I think if you look at the publications of also. the industry this year, we've already seen also, not only for us. But also for the industry. that these contributions cannot be taken into account as much any longer. Still, we. appreciate that ordinary investment or reinvestment yields are rising again.. Ulrich Wallin. I have to say that, at least, in previous years, we normally somewhat outperformed our. ROI guidance.. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research.. Andrew James Ritchie. I think, Uli, you suggested there was continued appetite out there for more demand for. structured solutions in the P&C Re business. Is there any sort of natural limit to how much. of this business you want to write? Presumably, more -- there will be a greater earned. effect on the combined ratio in '19 than what we've seen this year in terms of inflating the. combined ratio, I think. Just clarify that's the case. And related to these large deals, what. is the group's current appetite on U.S. casualty? I think it's not for some of the wider. nationwide deals. But maybe just clarify that.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, of course -- I mean, from principal point of view, we write the business that. fulfills our margin requirements based on our assessment. From that point of view, of. course, there is no limitation for our colleagues that do these deals. Of course, I mean,. we are looking a little bit more for structures that have a higher, say, EBIT margin based. on the premium. And of course, I mean, it's also a question on the margins which should. depend on the type of deal. But we still have -- continue to have an appetite for this deals. as long as we have a very good return on them on the capital (applied). So you would see. -- probably, growth of that is always a little bit difficult to predict because many of these. are written for 100%. And yes, I mean, we have already month for margin. And if. somebody else is prepared to calculate with a sharper pencil, they will get the business. If. we have a sharper pencil, we get it. So you can see, it's quite price-sensitive business. But. I think that you would see further growth in it. At least, that's set in the business plan for. next year. U.S. casualty, still, we are (enervate), I would say, on the large excess and. umbrella business, where we have hardly any on the books now, particularly U.S. We. continue to do that. I mean, where we write our U.S. casualty, which was just still a sizable. book, is more -- this is more to a medium-sized clients in the U.S. And it's more the many. and more specific contracts than writing single, large contracts on U.S. casualty. That, for. the time being, remains our strategy. We see positive movements in the U.S. casualty. pricing, which we, of course, observe, which slightly increases our appetite. But certainly. not for unsupported large excess and umbrella accounts.. Andrew James Ritchie. And just to be clear on the -- there is more inflation in the combined ratio from the. structured solutions next year, isn't there? In calendar year -- we haven't -- it hasn't fully. (run) through yet?. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. I mean, the returns on the structured solution business next year should increase. actually remarkably. And the reason for that is that we realized a profitability backloaded. on that. And particular the newer, larger transactions will contribute to the 2019 EBIT, more. -- significantly more favorable or more significant than we have seen in 2018.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas SchÃ¤fer from Bankhaus Lampe.. Andreas SchÃ¤f er. I just want to come back to the issue of Life & Health Re insurance. I mean, you mentioned. that this underlying EBIT of roughly EUR 150 million in Q3 was not really affected by huge. (exceptionals). But looking at your ordinary investment income or looking at your. investment income from own sums, it's almost EUR 100 million and EUR 20 million above. the run rate (of the first) quarters. Is there any part of big realized capital gains in the. earned EBIT of more than EUR 150 million? Or is that really a normal run rate in terms of. investment result?. Ulrich Wallin. I think, Roland, that's one for you.. Roland Helmut Vogel. We have not seen large realized gains or any extraordinary gains on the Life & Health. side. So in that respect, I'm not aware of any one-off here. So we should assume it is a. regular result here. So I think we will have to dig into that a little bit more. But again,. overall, there have not been any extraordinary investment gains on the Life side.. Andreas SchÃ¤f er. I was just pointing to the fact that the, overall, your realized capital gains were, again,. pretty high at almost EUR 50 million. So it's just P&C? Or.... Roland Helmut Vogel. Again, as we mentioned before, of course, the contribution from the realized gains, it. didn't -- that also had to do with the restructuring on the Life side. Early this year, we had. to move some investment portfolios from one jurisdiction to the other based on the tax. reform. That came with some realized gains already. And as I mentioned before, we will. not see these realized gains into the future. Still, as the reinvestment deals are rising. And. we see the still positive cash flow increasing the assets under own management, we do. assume that the contribution on the net investment income side should be stable.. Ulrich Wallin. But we also see, I mean, good growth of the profitability, for example, of our Chinese. business. And that refers to both financial solutions as a lot of very traditional business. So. I mean, this kind of growth that we have seen on the Asian business, for example, or the. Australian business, is actually contributing very positively.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Fossard from HSBC.. Thomas Fossard. Two questions. One, remaining on the story on the investment income. Because looking. at Slide 10, Q3 stand-alone, ordinary investment income is at EUR 360 million. And this. compared to EUR 317 million Q1, EUR 317 million Q2. So still, there seems to be a pretty. significant pickup in the Q3 stand-alone. That would be the first question. Second question. would be relative to the Life business and the -- I mean, the financial solutions business,. which I think a significant part of it is coming in the order income and expenses line. So. actually, you're seeing a deposit accounting treatise generated an EBIT of EUR 144 million. year-to-date. This compared to EUR 139 million last year. So after a significant -- a couple. of years of significant increase, it seems to be that we are more, I will say, reaching now a. kind of plateau, flat EBIT growth on that side of the business. Could you comment a bit. more on what we should expect going into 2019?. Ulrich Wallin. Well of course, I mean, we had a significant increase in the deposit accounted income, I. think in 2017, which was related to a few large transactions. I mean, we still expect this line. to grow further. But of course not at the same pace as we have seen, unless we get a. similarly large transaction, which could be -- it's not that likely because, I mean, a lot of. that, the larger transactions revolves around XXX and AXXX reserving. And of course, this. principle-based reserving is the only older existing blocks of business. And so there's only. opportunities as they get, I mean, reshuffled. And I mean, it has changed in the way, say,. as the collateral debt finance. So I would expect that the deposit accounted income, we. are not dropping the coming years. But the growth of that will not be as pronounced.. Roland Helmut Vogel. Let's go back to the ordinary investment income. I think there was not a real structural. change in our portfolio, which would be a reason that we have a remarkable shift here.. And if stand-alone quarters deviate from each other, that might also really be an issue of. when funds or investment managers report what. Still, of course, as reinvestment yields. are rising and the cash flow was positive, one should assume that, over the course of the. year, the contribution to ordinary should be increasing over time just based on higher. reinvestment yields and that -- and the volumes which are accumulated. But that was not. driven by some structural changes in the portfolio. I hope that explains what's going on. here. So again, what you mentioned, this EUR 360 million here being higher than the. previous year and also being higher than the average of the previous stand-alone. quarters, I would not really see that going forward. But again, that this is rising over time,. that is explainable by, again, accumulated volumes and a little bit higher reinvestment. yields over the course of the year. But this is not -- it could also be really that some of the. investment income is accrued in the one month rather than the other month.. Operator. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Gandhi from Societe Generale.. Vikram Gandhi. I've got just one really simple question. Can you share the year-to-date EBIT contribution. from the financial solutions business on the Life & Health umbrella?. Ulrich Wallin. We should have that number somewhere. I think it's around EUR 180 million. Got it there,. correct?. Vikram Gandhi. Can I just check how does that compare with the 9 month over 2017?. Ulrich Wallin. It has increased, actually. I would say about 10% increase.. Operator. Thank you. And as there are currently no more questions registered, I now hand back to. our speakers for any closing comments.. Ulrich Wallin. Okay. Thank you very much for calling into this conference call of ours. And I wish you all a. very pleasant day.. Whatever you want to do, all the best. And goodbye.",20181108_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2018-11-8_SD000000002879406671.pdf,2018-11-08
33,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Interim Results Q2 2015. For your information, this conference call is. being recorded.. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to our host today, Mr. Ulrich Wallin, Chief. Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you. A very good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thanks for joining the. Hannover Re conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, Roland Vogel, and we are. pleased to present you the figures for the first half year of 2015.. Our business developed favorable with a 20% increase in Group net income to €532. million for the first six months. This leading performance enables us to raise our profit. guidance for the full year from around €875 million to around €950 million. The first half. year of 2015 also saw particularly stronger earnings on the Property & Casualty business,. on the Life & Health business, and most notably from our investment.. Gross written premium fared well with a growth of 9% adjusted for currency exchange. rate effect. At 14%, we again were able to achieve an attractive return on equity well. above our minimum target. Shareholders' equity increased to €7.7 billion, a little bit lower. than at the end of the first quarter. This is due to lower OCI from unrealized gains due to. the increased interest rates in the second quarter, and of course, also due to our special. dividends that we paid in the second quarter.. And this has meant that the growth of our capital has been reduced and slowed a little bit.. This, as far as the special dividend is concerned, of course, was the intention of it. So,. book value per share is now €63.62, and that is for the end of June. The overall business. developed especially gratifying because the general environment international reinsurers. are facing continues to be challenging.. Property & Casualty reinsurance in particular continues to be intensely competitive. The. resulting negative trends as rate decreases is now felt for two-and-a-half years or at least. two years, since mid-2013. So, some of the businesses like the Florida cat business, we. have the third consecutive renewals with reduced rates.. Needless to say that these adverse developments of the international reinsurance also. has implications on our business. Nevertheless, so far, we have been able to position our. company for continued success even in this climate. This is very much in line with our. amended strategy under the headline long-term success in a competitive business.. Particularly helpful has been our low expense ratio. And our extensive diversification, both. within our business groups, Property and Casualty, and throughout Life and Health. reinsurance, and between the two business groups.. Our Property & Casualty business recorded a pleasing currency-adjusted growth of. around 10% for the first six months of the year. The increase was driven by a number of. sizeable individual transactions, which are addressing specific reinsurance needs of our. respective clients. This is in particular applicable to some treaties we wrote from Asia,. North America, but also in the area of agricultural risks.. Additionally, our specialty unit, Insurance-Linked Securities, was very successful in the. second quarter in particular, and added besides attractive margins, also some significant. premium volumes. So, the growth overall on the P&C side is rather broad-based, as it. stems from a number of different regions and different classes of business.. The combined ratio of 95.4% is quite unchanged compared to the previous comparative. period. This is particularly gratifying as the confidence level of our loss reserves continues. to be comfortable, thanks to the considerable cushion that we built over the past few. years.. The development of the underwriting result which rose another 8% compared to the. previous period reinforces our strategy that we have provisioned Hannover Re's Property. & Casualty portfolio in such a way to be able to preserve a stable underwriting result even. in the current soft market. We are currently thoroughly satisfied with the premium. development of our Life & Health reinsurance group in the first six months.. Gross written premium grew by 9% on a currency adjusted basis, for this is especially. gratifying that the increase derived from the wide range of different areas and generated. substantial new business volume from our longevity transactions, but also considerably. expanded our business in South America, Australia and Asia.. The operating profit rose 29% to €200 million, this in line with the improved profitability. we had anticipated for our Life & Health business in 2015 as compared to 2014.. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the results in the second quarter on a stand-alone. basis fell short of our expectation. This was due once again to an unfavorable. development affecting parts of our US mortality portfolio in the second quarter, both the. mortality and the lapse rates showing negative divergences from the expected values.. A further factor was the results of our branch in Paris, which was affected by the. restructuring of business relationship with one of our major clients. Also, although this. gave rise to a negative result in the second quarter under IFRS accounting, it should have. a positive implication of Hannover Re's profitability over the medium and long term.. We are very satisfied with the development of our investments and our investment result. with the ordinary investment income from assets under management increasing due to. higher contribution from the fixed income portfolio, as well as the growing real estate. portfolio.. On that note, I would like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain these good. figures in more detail.. Roland Vogel. Good morning. Thank you, Uli. And as usual, I will focus on the half-year figures and try to. keep my comments as brief as possible. However, I think in some cases, further. explanation on the quarterly development might be helpful this time. As already. mentioned, we continue to deliver strong premium growth even taking into account that. roughly half of the growth is a result of the currency exchange rate movements.. Net premium earned increased by around 8% at unchanged currency exchange rates.. That is slightly less than the topline due to our ILS activities, where we get the premium in. and seed it out and some also fronting arrangements in the P&C segment.. Investment income, as mentioned, very satisfying, benefiting from the positive one-off. effect in Life & Health reinsurance in the first quarter. Additionally, our growing real estate. portfolio is paying off nicely. And finally, the strong dollar is also helpful, increasing the. income streams from our US dollar investments.. Other income and expenses still benefited from positive currency exchange effects,. which were mainly incurred already in Q1. Interest on hybrid capital still is at last year's. level. You may remember that we had the €500 million bond redemption on June 1. That. is, therefore, not yet visible. On the other hand, for the full year, this will of course have an. effect and lead to reduced interest payments as compared to last year.. After the slightly inflated level in the first quarter, the tax ratio is back to a normal level of. around 25%. As you might remember, we already indicated three months ago that we,. very early in Q2, received a tax refund at approximately the same level of an extraordinary. burden or payment in Q1, so this is fully in line with what we expected.. If we look at the capital side on the next page, you can see that the effect of the €500. million perpetual bond redemption in June, the remaining €1.5 billion of hybrid capital is. now at a level that we feel comfortable with. On the other hand, with the implementation. of Solvency II next year, this current level leaves us with a remarkable increase in financial. flexibility, as there is now a material headroom in all Solvency models going forward.. When it comes to the shareholders' equity, the effect of the interest rate movement is. very visible. In the first half of this year, the trend observed in the first quarter reversed as. a consequence of higher interest rates in the second quarter, with unrealized gains. decreasing by almost €450 million in the second quarter to minus €240 million year-todate.. Still for the first half of the year, this was more than offset by the weakening of the euro.. Moreover, the half year net income makes nearly exactly up for the 2014 full year. increased dividend payment, which then leads to the only slight increase overall.. Cash flow on the next page continues to be very positive in the first half year, slightly less. than €200 million above the previous year. The number for Q2 standalone seems to be. surprisingly low, but this is driven by some one-offs. We had a high cash outflow for the. Deepwater Horizon claim based on the legal clarification between the insureds, and the. same goes for the Tripoli airport claim from last year.. Moreover, there was one more technical item, as we had agreed with one cedent to. transfer monies we had kept as deposits on our balance sheet into a separate account,. which still serves as collateral for us, but now is no longer part of our assets. So, that. accounts for approximately €70 million.. All in all, we expect strong cash flows for the year in the region of the previous periods.. But, we should bear in mind, with additions to redundant reserves going down and growth. driven by large quota share arrangements, it should not be surprising if cash flows in the. years to come will come down from their peak levels.. Assets under own management increased by 3.2% to a level close to €37.4 billion. The. decline relative to the first quarter was mainly driven by lower valuation reserves as a. consequence of higher interest rates at the long end of the maturity curve. Overall,. decreasing valuation reserves had a negative effect of around €400 million in the first half. year.. The positive impact from currency exchange rate effects, in particular here the USD was. around €1.8 billion. P&C gross premium we mentioned that increased by a remarkable. 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. Uli already mentioned the areas of growth, mainly driven by. large individual transactions in Asia and North America.. Overall, it's quite pleasing to see that there is a rather healthy demand among our clients. for high-quality reinsurance products and services. At 5.1% of the net earned premium,. major losses were again below the budget in the first half year. However, the large loss. experienced in the second quarter increased compared to the very benign first quarter,. with the budget being exhausted for Q2 on a stand-alone basis.. The underwriting results is again on a very good level, the combined ratio, 95.4% is as. expected and below the full year maximum target of 96%. With the very positive overall. result in mind and in line with our practice, let me again repeat that we repeated our. practice employed in the past that we kept our large loss expectations as IBNRs within the. reserves, and that overall accounts for approximately a buffer of €100 million.. Apart from that, let me mention that reserves ran off positively, but to no extraordinary. extent. So, we saw the usual positive run-off. The confidence level of the reserve portfolio. should overall be at least stable. And by the way, let me mention that you will find the loss. triangles published as usual – usually on our website at that point of the year.. Mainly as a result of currency effects, as already mentioned, other income and expenses. improved compared to last year. Altogether, an EBIT margin of more than 15%. Net. income increased by 20% to above €400 million. The P&C segment performed very. satisfying in the light of the challenging market environment all around the world.. P&C results by line of business on the next page demonstrate that most lines of business. continue to show good underwriting profitability. On the other hand, it is clearly visible that. margins get closer to their respective hurdles, and also that the cat business, which with. its very low losses is an important contributor to the overall results.. Aviation impacted by three large losses that incurred in the first six months. In Marine too,. we experienced a number of large manmade losses. Here you have to bear in mind that. those claims, to a larger extent, also impacted the Facultative business line.. I think we can through the next slide rather quickly. As already mentioned, major losses. below average budget, entirely driven by the very benign first quarter. The second. quarter losses almost exactly hit our budget of €137 million. And although some of these. losses actually occurred in the first quarter and only made it over the large loss hurdle. during the second quarter.. After six months, 12 major losses are showing up on the large loss list. The impact from. natural catastrophes rather benign, and more than half of the net losses are result of. manmade losses. Here, the biggest part is coming from the Marine, with three out of. these four claims being damages from oil platforms that is dominated by the Pemex loss. of €33 million net in our account.. Overall, close to €100 million of unused budget, as already mentioned, is carried forward. for the remainder of the year. The topline development of the Life & Health, very. favorable with currency adjusted growth of around 9%. As in previous periods, emerging. markets especially Asia have been a driver of that growth. We also took advantage of. opportunities in improved markets in Australia, as well as from additional longevity. transactions especially also here in the UK.. With the EBIT number of €200 million, the overall profitability improved by almost 30% as. compared to last year, because the result is particularly driven by the financial solutions. business, where we even adjusted for the one-off effect of the first quarter. You may. remember the termination fee of one of the contracts accounted for some €39 million.. But, even if we back that out, the first quarter EBIT margin – or the EBIT margin would. account for an excellent 17.1%.. And additionally, with 3.5% EBIT margin, our longevity business contributed well. This is the. result, I should not repeat the reasons which Uli had already mentioned, the unfavorable. development of the mortality experience, as well as the lower-than-expected income. from France, which all in all also can be seen as an investment in the future. Overall, we've. seen quite a volatile development in our Life & Health business over the first half year,. with an extraordinarily good first quarter, and a rather weak second quarter.. Neither the first nor the second quarter should be seen as a guidance for the full year. We. do expect normalized results for the full year over and above the 2014 numbers, as we. had expected. Aside from the one-off effect, net investment income was very much in line. with our expectations. Just as an information, the effect from our ModCo derivatives was. a minus €6.4 million in the first half year.. Looking at the investments, I'm quite satisfied with the result of the first six months.. Ordinary investment income came in at 3.3% on an annualized basis. The Life & Health. financial solutions termination fee agreement accounted for around 20 basis points. That. still leaves 3.1%, which still beats the hurdle. If we look at the number overall and back out. of the inflation swaps in the ModCo number is, all-in-all, 3.4%.. We only moderately realized gains below last year's level, leaving valuation reserves on a. very comfortable level despite the increase in interest rates. This result was achieved with. the help of an increased exposure to real estate, as well as the overall increased asset. volumes. The increase of the impairment line is a result of ordinary depreciation on real. estate, with actual impairments again being on a negligible level.. At the bottom of that slide, you can see the effect that increasing yields in the second. quarter had on our valuation reserves. The absolute amount slightly decreased compared. to the end of the last year and decreased significantly to the end of the first quarter.. However, with still almost €2 billion in unrealized gains and especially viewed from an. economic perspective, this development doesn't concern me too much. On the contrary,. it is actually positive for our returns going forward.. I think this concludes my remarks, and I'll leave the rest to Uli as usual.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Well, the target matrix that you see here shows almost ticks on all. targets, which is the result of a rather favorable development of our business. So far, in. 2015, that it. I will move on directly to provide further insights and our expectation for the. remainder of the year. This shows you the development of the renewals of our P&C. business over the years. It excludes facultative and structured insurance, also excludes our. ILS activities.. As you can see in the second quarter, 17% of our traditional non-life treaty book came up. for renewal. The outcome of this renewal launch in 1/6, 1/7 – or if you are American, 6/1, 7/1. -- have actually been quite positive for us. While – I mean, the renewals on some of our. North American business and some of our agricultural business, good portion of our Latin. American business and our Australian business. And as I said, overall, we saw a positive. development. In Australia, in particular, we were able to increase our market share.. Despite significant capacities in the natural catastrophe market, both actually for treaties. on a proportional as well as on a non-proportional basis, due to our extensive product. range, we are able to offer our clients, we saw new opportunities in Latin America and the. Caribbean. And we were able also to further diversify our agricultural book of business. with actually quite significantly new additions to our business.. While this is in particular some Indian business, but also some business from the US. North. American rates and conditions remain under pressure. So, rate reductions were. somewhat smaller than anticipated by some. Further demand driven by improved state of. the economy was a key factor here. Despite below average natural catastrophe. expenditure and relatively modest fire losses, the renewal for US property business. passed off favorably.. Based on our good rating and market standing, ceding companies largely consider us as a. preferred partner, and we see the entire spectrum of the outgoing reinsurance business. for underwriting. As a result, we were able to expand our proportion of business with. conditions remaining largely stable. Rates on the non-proportional loss reinsurance. programs show declines of around 5%.. In US, property cat business had a pressure on price eased somewhat because the rate. reductions in 1/6 and 1/7 were a little bit smaller than in previous renewal periods. But,. don't forget, it's the third consecutive renewal on this business where rates are reduced.. Nevertheless, we were able to increase our business slightly on business that's still. fulfilling our margin requirements. This is largely due to additional demand of cat covers.. Casualty business in the US remained competitive. Nevertheless, we were able to write. some new opportunities. We in particular saw increased demand for insurance and. reinsurance in respect of cyber risk. Overall, this means that our premium volume on the. renewals in the second quarter increased by 8% on – from exchange rate adjusted basis.. In view of the good results of the first-half year, as we already said, we are raising our. profit target to €950 million. We also raise our growth target, where we set stable to. moderate growth, we now think that we will achieve growth between 5% and 10% on a. currency adjusted basis. And this is rather prudent because the new business that we. have written so far this year both on the Property & Casualty business, as well as on the. Life & Health side, does secure that growth.. Looking at the individual areas of our Property & Casualty business, you can see that. overall, we still expect profitability above the cost of capital. That's true for most lines. But,. you can also see, as Roland already mentioned, that – I mean it's getting a bit tighter, and. this is not surprising due to the continued soft market.. We still see growth in that business. Here, of course, on a non-adjusted basis for foreign. exchange rates, all the arrows are basically turning upwards. But well, for the current year,. I mean as we already alluded to, we expect on the Property & Casualty side good growth. at acceptable profitability. Life & Health, we also see further growth. It doesn't look like. growth on the financial solutions business. However, this business -- large part of the. business is actually not really topline accretive because it's either deposit accounting or. even showing up as an investment like the business where we saw the extraordinary. positive effect in the first quarter.. Therefore, here, if you talk of growth you have to look at the bottom rather than the. topline, and we expect good growth here. Otherwise, I mean, we expect profitability also. in our longevity business coupled with growth and a return to, I mean, profitability above. the hurdle rate, particularly on our mortality business for the entire year.. This slide may look familiar to you because we show it continuously at occasions like this. one for the last two years. It summarizes the rationale behind our confidence to be in the. position to deliver attractive results also in the currently prevailing difficult market, both. from a competitive point of view, as well as from the view of the continued low interest. rates. We feel that these factors of our business should hold true also for the coming. years, in particular 2016 and 2017.. We continue to be on track with increased profits on our Life & Health business of the. current year compared to previous years. As Roland already alluded to, we do not believe. that the rather low profitability in the second quarter on a standalone business signals a. negative trend for the future development of our Life & Health business. We feel this is. just a reminder of the quarterly volatility of the quarterly profitability of the business, and. hence, as we've said all along, looking at Life & Health business on a quarterly basis is not. all that meaningful. The volatility, of course, is significantly less on an annual basis where. we feel that the positive trend is fully intact.. On the Property & Casualty side, the half yearly results demonstrate the resilience of the. technical profitability of our business. It is in particular gratifying that due to our market. position and good rating from the rating agencies, we are able to secure our renewal. portfolio, and in addition, see a good flow of new business. This allows us to continue with. our selective underwriting activities.. On the other hand, we clearly are not isolated from the rate reductions that are prevailing. in the majority of the Property & Casualty reinsurance business. This had meant that our. initial loss ratio fix on the newest underwriting years will most likely not increase to the. overall confidence level of our loss reserves as it has been done in the years, say, for. example 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, it would appear that, at this point in time, the. buffers on our loss reserves is maintained, but probably not added to.. Regarding the investment income, the current development supports our expectations. that this will be stable in absolute terms despite the continued low interest rate. environment. We continue to strictly control the development of our administrative. expenses. And coupled with the growth of the business, this has led to a reduction of our. admin expense ratio rather than an increase. In addition, this was helped by the. weakening euro, so expenses are heavier weighted towards euro than our profit streams.. This brings me to the end of the presentation. We feel that Hannover Re should be well. positioned to continue to deliver attractive returns to its shareholders. One good news at. the end, which is actually hot off the press and came brand new, as you know, we were. engaged with our regulator to get our group model for Hannover Re Group as a. subgroup of HDI Group, approved by our regulatory, the BaFin. And actually, we today. received a letter that this internal model has actually been approved by the BaFin. It's our. own internal model on all quantitative issues and the standard model for the operational. risk. On this basis, our solvency level stands at 265%, which can be seen as true Solvency II. solvency level now.. On this note, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation, and we will. be very happy to answer your questions. Thank you.. Q&A. Operator. Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes. from In-Yong Hwang of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.. In-Yong Hwang. Good morning. This is In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Just two questions from me.. Firstly, on the combined ratio, Roland, I know you mentioned that the robust result was. roughly in line with what you were expecting. Does that mean that you had around €50. million run rate that you guided to previously for the second quarter, or does that mean. €100 million for the first half because I think there was no reserve release in the first. quarter? So, a bit around that would be useful.. much opportunity do you see from, I guess, the premium leakage that will emerge from. the merger of your peers and how much of that have you seen – how much of that. boosted your premium growth for this year? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. If I may come back to that reserve run-off, I think I tried to explain last year at the occasion. of the Investors Day that it is really not too easy to analyze that just without going into the. details. But I can say, overall, that it is the usual run-off, which should be in line with the €50. million per quarter. And in that regards, the around €100 million should be the number,. which we have seen for the first half year.. You mentioned that we didn't have any, I think we had only less than usual. We also had a. positive run-off already in Q1, not to the full €50 million, so obviously, this has made up. within the first half year.. Ulrich Wallin. If I may comment on the M&A opportunities, opportunities arising from M&A, in general it. is positive for us to generating new business if we have mergers between reinsurance. companies because that normally opens up some opportunities. However, if you look at. the merger activity so far this year, the majority has come actually from mergers of. insurance companies.. Most notably, if you look at – I mean, ACE and Chubb, and also XL and Catlin, was more. geared to the insurance rather than the reinsurance industry. So, I mean, that is more. negative for us because it normally takes out a client. So far, we have fared well actually in. both of these situations, but it's pretty new. So, I would say this merger and acquisition. activity, if not not opening up that significant opportunities to us, but we have been. through things like that before, and I don't think it should create a problem for us either. particular with the ones that have happened recently.. In-Yong Hwang. Great. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Andy Broadfield of Barclays Capital. Go ahead, sir.. Your line is open.. Andy D. Broadfield. Good morning. Yes, Andy Broadfield from Barclays. I want to ask two questions, please.. The first one is, again, just coming back to the reserves, I'm getting a little confused now,. because I think in the opening comments in your (40:31) you talk about that you expect. the underlying reserve strength to slightly weaken, yet you say both you and Roland this. morning on the call that you think it's probably where it was.. So, I'm little confused whether we're weakening or whether we are where we are – where. we were, should I say. And if you can quantify that in terms of what difference do you think. that would have made the combined ratio this year versus last year, given last two years it. was strengthening a little, and that would be helpful.. And the second question, just a small thing actually, I noticed that you shifted quite a lot of. assets out of held-to-maturity category in the quarter. Just wondering whether you could. give us a little bit more clarity about what you're doing on the investment side in terms of. shifts in asset allocation. Thank you.. Okay. Well, I'll take the one on the loss reserves. I mean, the loss reserves from the older. underwriting years, say, 2013 and before, they're of course running off and running off. those loss reserves. Of course, some number of claims have closed. And in this case, if. we have over-reserved them, we see the normal release of loss reserves that go to the. bottom line.. However, overall, I would say that has not been a major factor in the combined ratio as we. have seen. Where we say that the loss reserves are weaker, also have a major effect on. the combined ratio, it's on the new underwriting years, because -- I mean, we kept our. loss ratio picks, say, in the current year and also I'd say in 2014 quite stable, despite the. fact that rates were coming down. And we did that because we have clear evidence by. the development of the redundancy that in previous years, when the rates were better,. the initial loss reserves that we booked were significantly over-reserving. And this, of. course – this newer loss ratio picks, say, on underwriting year 2014 and 2015 is to a much. lesser extent the case.. You would not necessarily see that on the combined ratio, because the combined ratio, of. course, is the same for the newest underwriting years, as we have shown it, say, in 2012. and 2013, now maybe even 2011. However, the underlying rates are less if ever there's. (43:26) a quality. I mean, that's basically the reason behind why Roland and I cautioned. you a little bit regarding the development of the roster (43:36) redundancies.. Roland Vogel. But on a pure technical note, Andrew, the runoff of reserves as compared to last year. should be on the same level. And the confidence level should at least not have been. weakened as compared. So, there was not a weakening, but as we had indicated, the. strengthening might on the basis what Uli had explained might not have occurred as in. previous years. But there was no weakening at all. Again, runoff on the same level as last. year. And the current year, at least, a confidence level which we have in the reserves. already.. composition has broadly stayed on the same level. If you look at the numbers in the. appendix, you will see that we have increased our investments on the GAVI side a little bit.. take less risk on the GAVI side to reduce risk here and increase it on the perhaps lower. on the same level, that is the background why the GAVI portion increased slightly.. year, remarkable. You see that the overall volume is increasing, so just to keep the level of. the real estate on the same level as compared, it needs that – it means that we have to. invest more here. But we have also an initiative to increase that.. So, these are the major issues, a little bit what we internally call the barbell strategy to. take more risk on the lower credits and increase liquidity on the GAVI side. That is the. driver. If you ask me where the reinvestment yield is today, for the first half year, we have. reinvested at slightly over and above 2%, if the pure reinvestment yield, as I usually show. it, is a little bit over 1.8%, which would be on the basis of the current investments.. Andy D. Broadfield. Thank you. I mean, the thing I'm referencing, but maybe we could take it offline, is health. and maturity lines come down maybe €0.5 billion quarter on quarter in the accounts,. which given enough mark-to-market, I thought that looks like there was a shift to other. end.. Roland Vogel. No, that is – that, Andrew, is more on the technical note. The old hold-to-maturities are. running off, and we did not change the portfolio. We've just not added those new. investments to the hold-to-maturity bucket.. Andy D. Broadfield. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Go ahead, sir. Your line is. Kamran Hossain. Good morning. Two questions. First one, I guess, congratulations on getting approval for. the Solvency II model. I just had some thoughts. You seem to report a 285% or 286% ratio. at the full year results. Just explain kind of what the differences are between that ratio and. the 265% ratio you've kind of mentioned this morning. So, what was changed there? And. secondly, just on the US mortality in kind of flat issue in the quarter, is this the end of that. issue or should we expect kind of more impact to come through over the following. quarters? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, firstly on the difference in the solvency ratio, that has almost exclusively to do with. the fact that, when we showed our internal model results, we had the operational risks at. our own operational model. Whilst in the approved model, the operational risk is on the. standard formula, because we couldn't agree with our regulator how to approach the. operational risk. So, in the official Solvency II number, on that, we use the standard. formula. And only on the quantitative issues we use, actually, our full own internal model.. On the mortality from the US, it will be an optimistic view, I think, if we assume that we will. have no negative effect in the future. That is not from our new business that has actually. performed very well, it's still from the acquired ING block.. There is in-force management underway. I mean, we have been a little bit delayed with. our efforts to reduce the collateral costs, but we now expect that to come onboard. anytime soon in this quarter. This is also a part of below expectation result. And of course,. we expect it to be enforced for the entire next year, and the coming years, so which is. actually a low-double-digit improvement of the result, I could say around €26 million per. year.. And in addition, I mean, we continue to carefully bring some of the rates on the old YRT. business, which would also show an improvement in the future. That said, I mean, on the. ING block, we still would not see, I mean, I think a profitable future. The overall mortality. business, if you include everything, should see a continued improvement from the growth. of the new business there.. Kamran Hossain. Thanks very much. Very clear.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir. Your. line is open.. Michael I. Huttner. My first question was basically a follow-up. So, on the life, given at the half year, you had. €140 million, and the aim is to achieve a fee of €46 (51:01) million, how can you be sure,. that was my question here, that you can do that? Have you got some, I don't know, just a. question.. The other question is the share of equity (51:22). All the other companies I've followed. have beaten estimates, so you wouldn't know what my estimates are, so you feel,. Michael, that's completely irrelevant, but I noticed you did have – there was quite a large,. for me, against my expectations slightly large swing in unrealized gains on realized losses. in the second quarter. I just wonder, is this to do with – is your portfolio more sensitive to. interest rates maybe than peers, or is there something here that I'm kind of missing a. little bit?. And then, the last one and maybe it's also to do with FX. You are growing aviation, but. you're saying aviation is negative and I couldn't quite reconcile that. As you know, it's in. that lovely slide where you have the arrows and the pluses and minuses. That was all.. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Taking the aviation first, Michael, this is purely currency. And adjusted for exchange rate,. aviation is actually coming down in premium. With the way the rates are going on aviation,. I would be hesitant to say it's also going down next quarter, but it's definitely going down. in premium.. How can we be sure on the Life & Health that still achieve our full-year target? Well, the. reason is that, of course, partly the second quarter was one-off effects and we see. continued increase of profits, particularly from our financial solutions business, and I mean,. from other new business that we have written newly in the current year, so the profit. are trying to positive on the further development of our Life & Health business, despite. the fact that the second quarter may put some doubts in the observer's mind.. Roland Vogel. Yes. Mike, I didn't quite understand whether you were referring to the unrealized gains. and losses in our investment portfolio exclusively, but also the realized – we did realize. less than last year. Last year, we had the change in the reporting currency in Bermuda,. which has triggered some realizations or some turnover and realizations, so that went. down a little bit. We could have done more, but there was no reason to do that. So, we. only realized profits very moderately. That is the answer to the realized gains and losses. in the P&L.. When it comes to the unrealized gains and the sensitivities, I think we gave them on a. pro-forma basis, or we give them on a pro-forma basis for a long, long time. Of course,. that is 100 basis points across the board or the forward curve. What has materialized now. is exactly what we have seen. We have a rather high US dollar portion, which is 45% or so.. We have modified duration in the fixed income portfolio of a little bit short of 5. And in. that regard, the rate increases we have seen, really, that is a mathematical exercise, I. would say. I would be surprised if that comes to different result in other portfolios. Still, I. think the portion of unrealized gains and losses as compared to the overall portfolio in our. case is rather high, as again, we looked at realizations moderately. But, again, to your. model and as compared to the competition, I couldn't say more.. Michael I. Huttner. Absolutely. That's fantastic. That's very helpful. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Go ahead, sir. Your line is. open.. Ulrich Wallin. I think, Thomas, you may go ahead if you want.. Thomas Fossard. Hello, can you hear me?. Ulrich Wallin. Hello, we hear you very well.. Thomas Fossard. Okay, sorry about that. Just two questions on my side. The first question would be related. to your 260% Solvency II ratio. Can you help us to better understand what is your view on. the level you should be in Hannover Re at – what you see your shareholders willing you to. keep as a Solvency II ratio? 265% looks very high. I mean, how should we look at this ratio. going forward?. And the second question would be related to your upcoming business pipeline and. especially on the P&C side, I think that your French competitor on the P&C side indicated. that the pipeline was pretty attractive and full of what he named as capital management. deals or transactions, which all relates to the implementation of new solvency schemes. and things like that, so the population of Solvency II in Europe, but not only in Europe. I. think on that front, you're more speaking about potential business opportunities for your. Life & Health businesses. Is this something that you're expecting, as well, to come for you. on the P&C side? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, if I take the latter, I mean, yes. I've always said all along that the risk-based capital. regimes are modestly positive for reinsurance. And that's also borne out by what's. happening now, particularly this C-ROSS in China. I mean some of the treaties become. maybe not quite as positive as our French competitor. But you can see that our advanced. solutions business is actually growing quite nicely and will continue to grow, because here. we see new opportunities particularly also in the field of industrial captives, where it's. pretty new for us. I mean financial solutions for industrial captives, we do for the last. couple of years, and we are well on track there to add new business.. So, I mean, I've never been very enthusiastic about the business opportunity from. Solvency II, but I would say it's slightly positive. Because, it also has negative effects. For. example, if you look at the Chinese motor quota shares are bought for solvency relief,. they on the C-ROSS would not be as efficient because the capital allocation to motor. business and the C-ROSS is less than on the current kind of solvency run in China. So, it's. not all positive.. If you look at the target solvency ratio, it's a mixture of targets that we have to look at. because we have to look at the rating agencies as well. On the Solvency II ratio, what we. are aiming to have is a confidence level of 1 in 3,000 years. I mean, of course, a pure. Solvency II ratio is 1 in 200 years, so 99.5% confidence level.. It turns out that at Moody's, the confidence level for 1 in 3,000, which is kind of a AA level,. say, in S&P terms, is about twice the capital you'll need for confidence level of 1 in 200. years. So, I mean, I think we would always want to maintain Solvency II ratio quite ahead of. 200%, I would say, because, I mean we want to depict ourselves as at least a AA credit.. So, I mean, that is – but there's still some headroom on that as well, also in the rating. agencies' models.. Does that answer your question?. Thomas Fossard. Yes.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Go ahead, sir. Your. line is open.. Vinit Malhotra. Hi. Vinit from Mediobanca. Just maybe two or three questions, if I can. First is on the nonlife combined ratio of 95% reported in second quarter. Could you update on the – what is. the thinking on the MtCR? Because normally, I understand that that's how the IBNR has. been – that's how -- usually that's a good guide to what the number could be. I. understand you've beaten that number. I'm just trying to understand if there's something. more between linking the MtCR in this quarter to either first (01:01:44), and if there's any. change to the MtCR levels that you think about.. Second thing is, please, can I request for a premium split, some idea between the three. products in the financial – in the life reinsurance because that seems to be provided. sometimes but not all the time, just if you could guide us a bit there. And lastly, I. remember already was some presented at the Investor Day on the hybrid capacity from. Solvency II. Would – and you had also, I think, mentioned that you're not necessarily going. to ramp it up, because investors might demand higher cost of capital for more leverage?. Is there a change in – do you see them – there's a need to do some more leveraging up. at Hannover, if it is around? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. I guess – I mean, on the combined ratio in the second quarter of 95%, it's still a little bit. higher than our peers, I would say. But, I mean, it's a little bit lower than we normally have. seen it, because really, I mean, we had a rather quiet quarter when it comes to past year's. loss development where sometimes, we always have something that develops in the. wrong way. Nothing in the second quarter, and therefore, the combined ratio is a little bit. more favorable.. MtCR's coming down gradually, but we are not reserving to the MtCR, Vinit. Then, our. actuaries – our reserving actuaries calculate their best estimate. They're not taking care of. the MtCR. I mean, because we are reserving on a purely non-discounted basis.. And on the premium split on the Life & Health, I haven't got it with me now. I mean, we. can give you that in detail, but still the largest volume is clearly on the mortality side. followed by longevity and the smallest on the financial solutions. But, Roland has just given. that split, so I hand over to him.. Roland Vogel. I'm not sure, Vinit, did you ask for just the financial solution product or the overall split?. Vinit Malhotra. I mean, the overall just so that we understand, I mean if you are trying to – if there are so. many differences in the various lines, it just makes it a little easier to model. Just a. request, okay. Because in the past, you used to provide – I mean, provide on and off piece. on these premium levels, whatever you can provide?. Roland Vogel. I'm sorry. The composition of the half year premium was €1.6 billion. Mortality and financial. solutions, €560 million. Here, you should bear in mind what we said before that a lot of. these transactions are deposit accounting and do not produce accounting at all. Index. solutions longevity accounted for €720 million and the mobility solutions another €700. million.. Vinit Malhotra. Okay.. Roland Vogel. I hope that helps. If I can come back to your leverage and hybrid discussion, yes, I. mentioned already last year that Solvency II will ease our considerations remarkably,. especially in combination with the rating agencies' rules. That means that, as from next. year onwards, we have headroom, as I mentioned, that is between €1 billion and €1.5. billion. Such an amount would be accepted as capital credit in all of our solvency models,. being the internal or the various rating agencies and what you have. So, that increases our. financial flexibility. We could use that.. We also mentioned that leverage is, of course, a potential measure to improve cost of. capital and improve ROEs. Right now, we see that as financial flexibility to do things, and it. gives us also the opportunity to potentially look at redundancies or comfort levels in our. straightforward capital a little bit more flexibly. Right now, we have not – we have no plans. to really increase it, but we have the means and ways and the headroom to do it from. one day to the other, which to me as a CFO is a positive.. Vinit Malhotra. All right. Thank you.. Operator. Okay. Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Go ahead, sir. Your. line is open.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Hi there. First of all, I wonder if you could just give us, Roland, the P&L effect of FX in the. first half ? Or another way of putting it, how much of the increase in guidance for the full. year is reflecting the FX effect that has gone to the P&L, I guess it's mostly in the other. income line, but maybe just clarify the overall FX effect, that would be helpful.. Secondly, what is the expected benefit from the French restructuring with the clients? And. you talked about the impact in Q2 and when does that come through the P&L. And the. third point, just a clarification, I assume – I mean you're talking about how you've got. increased capital flexibility now you've got the model approved. Presumably, I mean the. rating agency remains a binding constraint. Is there any reason why your surplus on the. rating agency models should have changed materially over the first half ? Thanks.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, I mean the P&L effect on forex, I will leave it to Roland, because it's really a difficult. question. The expected profitability from the French business – from the business written. by French branch that had large client, we expect that to I mean be visible, even though. we will not point it out separately maybe from next year, because there are new. opportunities that we have from that.. And I mean, rating agency capital ratios, yes, they have been quite stable actually.. However, I mean, the flexibility as Roland has just mentioned, increases because – I mean,. if we come under constraints there, we now can use a hybrid to make up for it, which in. the past due to the -- particularly this run rating agencies, due to the hybrid allowed under. Solvency I in Germany was restricted, which is now not restricted to anywhere close to. that extent.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay.. Roland Vogel. Andrew, when it comes to the currency exchange rate effects, we have to distinguish two. issues. On the one hand, we tried to have our balance sheet matched as far as possible.. And to the extent that this doesn't work here, we have currency exchange rate effects. which materialized then in the other income and expense line. So, if I'm on the balance. sheet short in dollars or long in dollars, that has an impact.. That is a little bit less than €50 million for the year, but would not be the basis for any. increase in our guidance or profit expectations, because usually, we see that as a flat. position now for the first year. It is positive to the extent, which I have mentioned, but this. would longer term always be seen as neutral.. I don't know whether you remember, I think we did the math together when we spoke at. the Investors Day. Apart from that effect, from the pure matching effect of the asset and. the liability side, we have an increase in profits this year – or the running profits, for. instance, the coupons which we get on our fixed income portfolio, which come in as. dollars and are then translated on the P&L into euros. And the weaker the euro is, the. higher that amount is. That is difficult to isolate.. Again, I did – we did the math together last year and I think we saw that going forward, an. increase of – I don't exactly remember, was it 10% – could result in a €60 million increase. in profit. But that was a rule-of-thumb calculation. So, I would say, overall, the increase in. guidance has nothing to do with currency exchange rate expectations and assumptions.. Andrew J. Ritchie. So by implication, you're assuming those gains reverse in the second half then?. Roland Vogel. No. We do our math on the basis that the currency exchange rate, so we do our. expectation for the year that the currency exchange rate does not change. But, I would. not base any guidance assumption really on that remaining, so we see it to stay where it. is. But, if it was just the currency exchange rate effect, we would not have increased our. guidance.. Andrew J. Ritchie. Okay. Thanks.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Haid of MainFirst Bank. Go ahead. Your. line is open.. Michael Haid. Thank you very much. Good morning. Three questions, if I may. First question, can you. shed a little bit more light on the growth in P&C Re. My understanding is that some of this. growth is achieved by an increase in the sales that your clients feed to you and that you. take. Can you indicate kind of the nature of these increases in the shares, which they. typically have? Is it more that this indicates where you move from the number two position. to a number one position, or is it that you increased your share where you had the. number one position already before, or is it that you increase your share from 5% to 10%,. or 5% to 20%? Just a little bit more light on this.. Second, on the price decline in the July renewals, minus 5% in the non-loss-affected lines.. You mentioned that there were some price increases in loss-affected lines. Can you give. us an average effect? I have no feeling for how much business was loss affected.. And the third question, on financial solutions, can you give us the EBIT contribution from. the Life Re financial solutions business? In connection to that, it may be a stupid question,. but calculating an EBIT margin on the group level, when some of the business does not. have revenues, does it really make sense?. Roland Vogel. Yes. I mean, on the last one, I agree. I mean on the financial solutions, probably an EBIT. margin is less sensible. But I mean if I talk a little bit where the growth came from, some. come from larger shares in particular on the US -- in the US casualty business. However, I. mean, the majority of the growth comes actually from new, larger transactions in which -largely on those, I mean, our lines at a 100%, and we always have a number of those in. the pipeline.. I mean, the hit ratio is not overly large. This year, it has been larger. I mean, I say normally,. the hit ratio is not overly large, but presently these large transactions, of course, there is –. I mean, quite an intense negotiation on the terms and conditions, and we've got to stick. to our guns even if large premium volumes are at stake. So only right business that – I. mean, fulfils our margin requirements. Just this year, we have been successful with that.. And – but this is different to growth that, for example, we have seen in 2012. The growth. was driven by good market conditions, so the growth was from a number of treaties,. much broader-based. Now, growth in a soft market has been driven by individual large. transactions in specific situations, which we could benefit. That is the majority of it, actually.. And I mean, yes – I mean, we see increases on loss adjusted – on loss-affected business,. but I mean, overall, on the loss side, the development has been rather benign. That is of. course, I mean, only a small portion of our overall business. And therefore, I mean, we still. would say that the overall rating is actually declining, and maybe it's not 5%, but I would. say at least 4%, I mean, on average.. Michael Haid. Okay. Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. The thing that was – still the question open to the financial solutions on the Life & Health. side. Well, if you ask the question, does that make sense to do an EBIT margin also and. include business which doesn't produce premium? You could argue, yes. It's hard to deny. that. On the other hand, you also – to have lots or sometimes large transaction producing. lots of premium, with nearly no risk in there, which then would produce a low EBIT margin. but still be very profitable if you compare it to the risk we take. And on average, I think it's. still a meaningful number. Now, whether you ask for the number, I think the profit. contribution from that line is around €125 million.. Roland Vogel. (1:18:05).. Ulrich Wallin. Yes, EBIT.. Roland Vogel. EBIT-wise.. Michael Haid. Financial solutions, EBIT contribution €125 million?. Roland Vogel. In the first half.. Ulrich Wallin. In the first half.. Michael Haid. In the first half. Okay. Thank you very much.. Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Kopfinger of Commerzbank. Go ahead,. sir. Your line is open.. Frank Kopfinger. Yes. Good morning, everybody. My first question is on your manmade losses. You. experienced a high level there on the manmade claims that almost entirely ate up your. entire major loss budget. And also, if you take into account that you even have had some. improvements on the nat cat side first (01:18:45). So, the question is how do you see your. manmade assumptions going forward for the full-year there, and was this also – is the. manmade in your nat cat?. And my second question is on your new target, the €950 million, can you elaborate a little. bit on the drivers, how you came up to this figure? That would be helpful. And some. positive drivers, I would say, you have some still despite the major manmade claims are. below the budget for the half-year, but also return on investment as usual is a strong. 3.4%. Was this your expectation? Your target looks a little bit conservative. So, could you. elaborate a little bit on the drivers and why it's at €950 million?. Ulrich Wallin. Well, of course it takes into account that we will use the full budget of large losses. And. otherwise, I mean, it also takes into account that there is no extraordinary movement one. way or another even on currencies and things like that in the second half. And of course,. the basis for us is the bottom up forecast that we do on a quarterly basis following each –. the end of each quarter and each quarterly results. So, I mean, that's where it's all coming. from. It's not really a top-down number that I have dreamt up, when I couldn't sleep at. night. But, it takes into account that bottom-up forecast that we do.. I mean, manmade losses in the first half has been of – yes, I would say, above expectation. even though the calculation of the expectation on the manmade losses is less. sophisticated than on the cat losses. Because on the cat losses, we use our cat models. and calculate the expected losses that way. On the manmade, it is more of a long-term. average that we are looking at adjusted for the development of the premium income.. I mean, the losses have been on – I mean, run-off losses really on the offshore energy, the. three sizable platform and rig losses. Are those expected or not? It's really difficult to say.

34,"Well, good afternoon to everybody here in London and to all those joining us via the. Internet. Welcome to Hannover Re's Analyst Conference. Looking at the dialed-in list, it's. truly a pleasure to see so many of you taking up our invitation and are showing your. interest in Hannover Re. As you know, the key figures for the year 2018 have already been. released some four weeks ago, together with the outcome of the 1/1 renewal.. Today, we are delighted to present to you the full set of numbers in great detail. At first,. our CEO, Ulrich Wallin, will kick things off with a brief overview of the quite favorable. development in the year 2018, perhaps he will classify Hannover Re success over the time. as this is the 10th consecutive Analyst Meeting which he chairs. Roland Vogel, our CFO, will. then move on and dive into the business group performance, the investment result and. last but not least, the Group's strong capital position. This will be followed by the outlook. presented by Ulrich again. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond to all your questions. at length.. Today, we are also offering a dialed-in option for all those who are not able to be here is. London. As a reminder, the dialed-in participants will be in listen-only mode during the. presentations. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference will be recorded and a. replay will be provided on our website.. As always, I would like to draw your attention to the feedback form, which you will find on. your desk or you will receive via email. As you know, that we greatly appreciate your. remarks and ideas and they form part of the groundwork for our next Investors Day, which. will be held in October. Feel free to either leave the feedback form at the table or send it. into Julia, Axel or myself.. On that note, I am delighted to hand over to you, Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Yes. Thank you, [ph]Carl . Good afternoon, everybody. Yes, I mean one of the remarkable. things in 2018 for us was that we reduced our expense ratio again, but that's not the. reason that we changed venue, even though it may look like that. That was more a. question of logistics, I guess. So there will be change, not the expense ratio, but the. venue, you might be able to change that again.. Yes, 2018 was the second consecutive year of large losses for the industry, above. expected level and it was also the second consecutive year whereas the market results. have somewhat below expectations as a result of those losses and considering that we. are reasonably content with the results that achieved in 2018, our guidance that we had. given you for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2017 was that the profitability should be. more than EUR1 billion for the net profit and we kept that guidance all along unchanged. and actually delivered a EUR1.60 billion, which I think is a pretty good result for Hannover. Re. We also had good growth in our business, we currency adjusted double-digit, also this. was very much in line with our guidance all along.. The highlight, of course, this year was again the return on investments, which again with. the ROI of 3.2% gave us the extra lift that Roland has helped us with and many of the. previous years, he always delivers a little bit more than we ask him to (inaudible) continue. as well.. On the P&C side, the growth is clearly driven by increased demand for reinsurance and. the reason for that demand is besides capital management, also quite a lot of volatility. management, because also on the large commercial business, 2017 and '18, years that. showed quite challenging results and a lot of action has been taken by our clients in order. to improve the results and in situations like that, of course, you do not want to be derailed. by one big loss, which can be unfortunate and of course, yes, reinsurance, happy to help. our clients with that. That's the reason why on most of the major reinsurers, when you. look at their reporting on the P&C side, they report increased volumes. So everybody. reports increased volumes probably, the market has grown. I think that's a relatively fair. assumption.. You can see that the ROE remained positive in double-digit territory, 12.2%, that's well. above the minimum target of 900 basis points (inaudible) and it's particularly gratifying if. you compare to the average of our ROE of the, say, the 10 largest reinsurers. So it. continues to be the case that in years with many cat losses, we outperformed the market. to a larger degree than in years with very low cat losses.. You can see that both the EBIT as well as the net income was rising over and above 2017. levels, while that was to be expected because in 2017, we had even more losses. Also, as. we have publicized rather frequently or we had continued problems with our U.S. mortality. business on the life and health side. In the end, we had positive development there as. well, because I mean some of the reserves we're covering, as we said, Triple-X and. AXXX reserves, which are then ceded outside the U.S. The U.S. statutory reserving. requires those into other jurisdictions, but you would then have to collateralize those. reserves in order for the ceding companies to get reserve credit for the reinsurance. And. of course, as this is long-term business, the collateral has to be there for decades, and. you have to reserve first, because you know I have to pay collateral cost, say, for the next. 30 years or 20 years as the case may be.. We have many arrangements that brought down that collateral costs and we were also. quite successful in doing that in 2018 in relation to all the change of our business in. relation to the beat, so the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax where we have to reshuffle. our U.S. business and (inaudible) that some of those reserves (inaudible), still quite a bit of. those on the books, and so we had to release it. Nonetheless, the one-off negative effect. from recaptures offset partly by this release of expense reserves is still EUR185 million. negative. So we were relatively happy that we could absorb that pretty much as expected.. We also saw an increase in the book value per share that, which basically tells you that last. year we paid the dividend out of profits and not out of the capital base.. P&C briefly, I mean we had a nice outperformance compared to the market and this is. pretty much in line with our strategy that we believe that P&C is a competitive business. and you can only be a meaningful, successful in the long-term of that business if you. outperform the average peer and we were quite happy to do that. Life & Health, I think. the business has developed a little bit better than many surveys had expected, of course,. nobody had expected the release of the expense reserves, but also the underlying. mortality in particular on our problem U.S. mortality accounts that we bought from Scottish. Re at the beginning of 2009 was also giving us quite a nice lift because we had much. better claims experience on that business in 2018 as compared to 2017 and even a little. bit better than 2016. That was actually quite reassuring that the claims trend on that. business (inaudible) a trend to the downwards, and not only trend to the upwards. That. doesn't mean that the business is profitable, it's still negative.. Also, I mean our financial solutions business had a record year. And then also all our nonU.S. business had performing according to plan or in some cases, even better than plan.. On the investments, I was already telling you that this was again a very good year for. Hannover Re ROI, driven to a large extend also by good returns from our private equity. portfolio and our real estate portfolio was quite good.. I put this slide in just because it's the 10th year where I give you the report on the annual. results and when I started to do that for 2009 and -- in 2009, first time in 2010 for 2009, I. of course, gave the commitment that we will reduce the volatility of our earnings and we'll. be stable from a tenancy rising dividends, and if you look at this chart, that has actually. worked out quite nicely, particular, you can see that the earnings per share were quite. solid, and basically have a positive trend. And also we paid a dividend every year between. each of those years based on the share price at the time, with return on the market cap. of more than 4%. You can also see that in the last five years, we managed the growth of. the capital downwards. But we didn't manage the capital downwards, just the growth of. the capital.. And with that rather nice slide for myself, I would think we should become a little bit more. professional again. And for that, I hand over to Roland.. Roland Vogel. Thank you, Ulrich. I will try to continue to show impressive numbers myself as well. I think if. you are -- and if you might be, as you mentioned, be more professional.. On the first slide we see here the cash flow numbers, again a very strong cash flow of. EUR2.2 billion, which we very much appreciate and you might remember that at the. occasion of the Investors Day, I was talking a little bit about the positive cash flow and the. influence on especially our investment income. Because we talk a lot about ROI and also. Ulrich mentioned that, we are happy with the ROI but the investment income is a. computation between the volumes and an ROI. So in that regard, the increasing volumes. driven by the cash flow are important also for the investment income numbers. In the. future, we can see that cash flow seems to arrive at the assets under own management. on the right hand side, it's more a coincidence that we have the EUR2 billion coming in,. and a EUR2 billion increase of the assets on our management, because here of course,. we have currency valuation, we have the valuation reserves, we have issued a senior bond. early in the year and here, of course, all these different impacts are to be felt like, for. instance, a stronger U.S. dollar, but weaker valuation reserves based on higher spreads. and increasing yields, especially in the U.S. dollar.. Some of these impacts also have affected the shareholders' equity development Ulrich. already mentioned. We do show an increase in shareholders' equity also in 2018, if you. compare that to the competition, I don't know how many you find who did that. If we look. at the right hand side, you see that, of course, we have a positive impact from the good. EUR1 billion of profits. We paid out a dividend, the valuation reserves got cut down, as I. mentioned, based on increasing spreads and increasing yields, especially from the U.S.. dollar. The currency translation brings it up again. And overall, we have nearly 3%. decrease or EUR250 million increase in shareholders' equity for the year to come.. On the left hand side, what we here call or define as policyholders' surplus hasn't. changed drastically, we will come back to the EUR1.4 billion of hybrid, which are. outstanding. There is room for more and we will see that later on as part of our solvency. reporting. But again, nothing has changed here and these are still outstanding. But there is. room for more if need be.. Now, perhaps one of the more impressive charts and Ulrich had already addressed some. of the items here. We do see that the shareholders' equity has been increasing over the. last five years, quite remarkably from EUR6.7 billion to EUR8.6 billion, but we were able to. produce attractive returns in 2018 to 12.2% is a outperformance of our internal target of. 270 basis points. If we look at the five-year average, we even have a higher performance,. we ended in 30 basis points, Ulrich mentioned that within the last 10 years, every single. year showed a double-digit return, and also on the right hand side, you can take the fiveyear average or the 10-year average or the 15-year average, and we have outperformed. our internal targets by quite a margin.. That is the usual ranking, which we show as the ROE is our main profitability indicator or. measure. If you -- if we look at the 2017 years, we see that Hannover Re was only Number. 2. Last year with double-digit returns, here the number one was a U.S. life insurer, who was. very much helped by the US tax reform to produce the 24% ROE. Here, if we take that out. to some extent and I'm not saying that to disqualify that, but if we take that out, then also. the 5.7% industry ROE last year would have already been lower. And if we see the. development of the ROEs of the industry over the course of the years, they go down. If. we take out Hannover Re out of 2018 and take the average of the seven companies, who. have already published numbers, we arrive at 4.2% industry ROE. That, from our point of. view, is not sufficient. It should have an impact on the pricing going forward. But of course. it also demonstrates a little bit that especially in the years when we have high losses,. Hannover Re usually outperforms and you know, that this is one of the key drivers, is our. (inaudible) strategy, but also here again the 13.3%, I think is an impressive number. And we. feel very comfortable where we are here in the pool position.. Now to the Group's figures, we -- you've seen them earlier this morning, the main. measures have had already been published. So in that regard, we will come to the details. on a segmental basis. Only here, I might mention is the tax ratio, which is, from our point. of view, back to normal. It had been helped by the sale of the equities portfolio last year.. These profits were tax free, as you might remember, EUR224 million as kind of an. extraordinary tax -- nearly tax-free profit last year had decreased the tax ratio and the. EUR225 million, around 25-ish range I think that is something which we would expect as a. normalized tax rate. Ulrich had already mentioned, EBIT grew by 17%, also the net income,. double-digit growth, but also here we have to take into account and to admit that last. year was a year where we did not fully achieve our EUR1 billion target. So it was a little bit. easier to achieve these double-digit increases in 2018.. Let's come to the property and casualty reinsurance, where, well, things might not. become complicated, but where a few more comments might be valuable. The P&C. premium grew by 16% currency adjusted, that was helped by the structured reinsurance. was 16.7% and the surprising portion was -- is obviously not that the structured reinsurance. business was increasing or could be increased by 17% -- by 16%, but that also that what we. call here as the traditional and that might be a little bit misleading, it includes the ILS. business as well. That also, this has been growing by 16%. Also that has been driven by a. lot of -- or a good handful of larger contracts around the world. So for instance, the U.S.. was increasing by EUR200 million by EUR100 million worldwide treaty was increasing by. EUR450 million and the structured reinsurance by more than EUR300 million. So it was. really an around the world gross also outside the structured reinsurance segment where. we all had expected that gross already and where we had announced it. Structured would. have been even a little bit higher. You can see that on the net number, here we changed. accounting for one large contract, which then turned to kind of premium reserves into an. entry-out and an entry-in, so in that regard, the net premium here with more than 20%. indicates that change. So here, the net premium even increased by 22.5%.. So we will come to the large losses on the usual pages and slides in a minute. Let me. comment on the run-off result and the initial reserving and the confidence level. You -- or. most of you have seen that the table in our Annual Report shows the run-off result of. nearly a EUR1 billion, a little bit down from last year. The initial reserves, as we usually set. them up, we stuck to our usual policy. We will also see in a second that two lines of. business were affected by a positive run-off that was marine and credit and surety.. Marine, it is really quite obviously on one of the slides, because the combined ratio there. was only a 9% combined ratio.. So overall, one could see that -- so something of between EUR100 million and EUR200. million, one could define this extraordinary positive run-off. The issue here is that these. were, in most cases, case reserves. That was not driven by an ultimate loss ratio setting. by our Chief Actuary, but they were single case reserves, which we could no longer keep. up because it was quite clear that we wouldn't have to pay out on those and the impact. of the positive run-off of such case reserves to the large -- to the loss reserve. redundancies, this is where we really need the final study from Towers Watson. But again,. the guidance here would be EUR100 million to EUR200 million positive run-off, EUR100. million to EUR200 million decrease of confidence level possible. You know that we have. various parties and stakeholders looking at our reserve portfolio, that is our own actuary,. that is the auditors, that is Willis Towers Watson. We have indications that at least one says. that level should be stable. Some also indicates that the EUR100 million to EUR200 million. loss of reserve redundancy could be the result of the final study, so we will have to wait.. Still, if you remember the presentation at the occasion of the Investors Day, the reserve. level is still on a very comfortable level in any case.. Here are the large losses, we've commented on that more than once, EUR825 million was. the budget for the year. We had EUR850 million. It's interesting to see that last year we. had gross losses of EUR1.8 billion. this year, or in 2018, we had gross losses of EUR1.7. billion. If we assume that in both years, the impact of the ILS segment is around EUR400. million, a little bit less than that, if we deduct that, because that is in and out in any case. that with debt and would result in 2017 around EUR1.4 billion and in 2018, EUR1.3 billion, but. the difference between gross and net is remarkably higher in 2018. So the retro program,. which we had outstanding and the additional capacity, which we bought for 2018, really. did help the difference between gross and net in that case and of course, it is also one of. the drivers for the good result, especially as compared to the competition.. So usually, we come with one page of large losses. That was not sufficient this year, we. have brought with us two pages, one for the natural catastrophes and one for the man. made losses. Here you see the natural catastrophes. It started in Europe with (inaudible). but of course, over the course of the year, it ended with a very, very busy Q4, which. started with Michael, had the (inaudible) wildfire as the nearly largest loss. It turned out. that JV also developed a little bit over the course of the fourth quarter into the real. largest loss, you see that EUR135 million on a net basis, followed by (inaudible) the wildfire. in the U.S. by EUR130 million followed by the other. So a lot of frequency again, the the. retro structure, which we have in place, the (inaudible) the whole account protection plus. the aggregate large loss cover was very sufficient and that should also be the reason as. to why future development is potentially really limited. Also the retro structure did prevent. us from having a lot of negative run-off from the last year. Also here, we had some. development, of course, also from (inaudible) developed more positively, also they are. protected by both the retro structure, which we have in place. Overall, the development. also of the last year's losses were stable.. You see it on the next page, then the man made losses with accumulation of credit. claims, it was interesting, I think we never had four credit claims, which made it on the. large losses, still it is interesting to see that credits was seeing a positive run off. It saw the. credit claims, but even without the positive run off, it would have been still be possible, so. it was -- it is still a very attractive returns in that line of business. But you'll see that as we. are protected for natural catastrophes, here the numbers between gross and net are. (inaudible) each other.. That brings us to the -- of the various lines of business, and of course one could see the. impact of the large losses here in North America was affected also the Facultative. business, the worldwide treaty would have served, from our point of view, remarkable is. that our -- the Bermudian cat business, we're still within the target combined ratios with. 88%. But of course, this is where the natural catastrophes landed, and this is where also. the good protection of the retro program had its impact.. I had already mentioned the very, very positive result in Marine here. We didn't have a lot. of losses. So it would have been good anyway, and we had the positive run off. It looks. very impressive, we should be aware that marine these days for us accounts for a good. EUR200 million in premium, so we shouldn't overestimate the impact from such --- from. such a combined ratio. Also aviation, which had benefited from the reserve releases from. the WTC disaster last year, premium in that in that line of business also a little bit more. than EUR200 million only, that is different in -- for credit and surety, here we are talking. about EUR750 million, also as I mentioned, a very positive result and even without the. positive run-off and including the large losses, we would have seen a good result here as. well.. Premium wise, it may be worth mentioning the structured reinsurance, EUR2.9 billion, 24%. of the overall premium income, the largest segment with regards to gross premium these. days, again as I mentioned, the quarter of the overall premium. If you see that this comes. with a combined ratio of around 98%. You see, if you do the rough math, the impact of. the excess combined ratio quarter times 2% is 0.5%, we ended up at 96.5%. So in that. regard, of course, to be fair also in the previous years, we had some of the structured. reinsurance, but that might explain as to why we did not achieve the 96% target and as to. why we increased it to 97% in the coming years.. Coming to Life & Health. Ulrich had already mentioned, it was a positive surprise, we had. announced that the extraordinary burden from the potential recaptures based on our. price increases could be between EUR300 million to EUR350 million. That is what we. indicated with the maximum of EUR500 million in to EUR600 million. Now it turned out to. be EUR272 million, mitigated by the collateral reserve releases and ended up at EUR185. million. That, of course, is one of the drivers as to why we did outperform the reduced. expectations. Also the underlying business was very positive. Ulrich mentioned also the. U.S. Financial business was an all time high. So in that regard, we are really happy that also. this segment can come up with positive surprises, at least once in a while. We are still. careful going forward with our assumptions. If you ask us, is there more to be expected?. We might see EUR20 million to EUR50 million recapture impact in the first half year 2019.. Why is it EUR20 million to EUR50 million? I think EUR20 million is quite clear, this should. come, because the increases come with the renewal date of the policies, some of these. renewal dates are still up for -- they will come over the next few weeks and months. So in. that regard, that is a EUR20 million, which we will most likely see and the rest is to be. seen as to whether we're talking about one client here, they are thinking about going into. arbitration or not, if they choose not to, then we --- then they might recapture and we. might see the other EUR30 million, if not, then we won't see that and we will have to find. later on -- find that out later on.. I think gross, you can see, it was currency adjusted, 4.6%, not overwhelming but fully in. line with our expectations, that one of the main drivers, China and UK, longevity, as you. can see here. What else, I think as mentioned before, the EUR121 million EBIT for the last. quarter and the EUR276 million is still not living up to our expectations and profitability. targets we have defined. But I think, it's a very good basis for what we have to expect into. the future.. New business production goes down, is that disappointing? No, it's not, it is comfortably. over the hurdle of EUR220 million. Why is it going down? I think there was the one contract. in 2017, we cannot take that as a guidance at all. We have not been writing as much. permanent business in the U.S. anymore with a very, very long tail. This is where we are a. little bit more cautious, that of course, this business was a very, very long tail, where the. new business production is then very high, as we are a little bit cautious in that segment. as (inaudible) this is the reason why the production has come down a little bit. Again, we. are comfortably over our level. And I would also say that the likelihood of then future. adjustments by not writing that business anymore has also come down together with the. new business value. Again, we are significantly above the hurdle and we are not. disappointed at all.. So now the investments, Ulrich mentioned that we have increased our ordinary result. again, that was driven by increased volumes, also increasing reinvestment yields in the. U.S. dollar. You will remember the presentations which I usually give. So in the U.S. dollar,. the reinvestment yield was higher than the maturing yield, that has helped as well. The. private equity distributions as well as the real estate ordinary income was very positive. again. So these are sustainable supporters of the ordinary investment income. Realized. gains came down remarkably, of course driven by not being in a position to sell the listed. equities portfolio anymore, still it was EUR128 million. Also that line contributed, that was. driven a little bit by the derisking strategy. So we sold some of the really lower quality,. some of the lower quality funds with good capital gains by selling those. So we were. derisking a little bit. It was also our assumption that and -- in that regard, the timing was. lucky. I'm not telling you that I have that crystal ball, but when we were selling these funds. over the course of the summer, and then we saw the the spread widening at in the. second half year, I think that was good timing. We were expecting the spread widening to. go on. And we are also prepared to reinvest into the lower quality spectrum of the credit. curve now, since the beginning of the year, that trend reversed itself. We still see. opportunities and the -- and again the reinvestment yields have come down, again a little. bit. But with these communicating numbers also, the reserve numbers, valuation reserves. on the bottom of the page, which was coming down from, you might remember, we had. last week or so was EUR1.3 billion, again. So the rate decreases in the euro, as well as in. the U.S. and the spread tightening led to higher valuation reserves. Again, which you can. see as the Germans saying, would be with a laughing and a crying eye. On the one hand,. we were appreciating the increasing reinvestment yields, on the other hand, it's good to. have reserves.. Here is the usual slide, you can see that if you look at the governments line that we have. increased from 30% to 35%, that was also to some extent driven by an increase of our. inflation protection, which we do with inflation-linked bonds. These are usually. government bonds and we had increased our inflation protection one more time, that has. also increased the government portion to some extent. You also see that the noninvestment grade number goes down a little bit, the real estate goes up. These are not. not drastic changes, but they contribute. You also see where the ordinary income comes. from. So we have allocated 35% to govies, but only 25% of the net income comes from. the govies, if you look at the real estate portfolio, 6% allocation but 13% of the net. income. So very profitable, although, and I've mentioned that before, it's a little bit. inflated, because the cost is deducted elsewhere.. I think that then leads us to the first and preliminary number of our solvency reporting. You. might have to be a little bit patient to see the full reporting, which we will publish in April.. These are numbers, which we have produced today, the audit is not final. So this is why I. would call them draft. We don't expect changes here. The capital adequacy ratio comes. down, we still provide, by the way the internal metrics, the difference between the. internal and the formal metrics in the middle of that table here is the treatment of. minorities, because we still feel that the minorities is something which we have and which. we can work with (inaudible) or the regulators. Don't see it like this, and this is why we. provide the two numbers.. It has been coming down. We will see the history of that number, the increase or the. decrease of the number, sorry, is driven by the increase of required capital. You can -- the. own funds are increasing as well, but they would have to increase by the 2.6 times as. much to keep that stable, which they don't. So we have an increase in the own funds. But. the required capital goes up even more. The main drivers are the growth of the business,. which we like, so, some of you were complaining why we would have 260%, what would. we do with all of that excess capital? I do hear you complaining, also, some of you. complaining about that last year. Now we found ways and means to employ that -- at least. parts of that capital. One other contributor was the increasing spreads. With the. increasing spreads, we have increasing volatility assumptions and they also require more. capital. So, yes, it's a decrease, but we are still happy and we will see with the history. where we come from as to why we just only see that positive.. On the next page, you see the composition of the capital requirements. Not a lot of. change, Property & Casualty has of course increased, or the portion has increased based. on the growth, which we have been seeing the market value or the market risk still, the. most prominent risk here but only by a very, very slight margin anymore and within the. market risk is spread risk is the main contributor, 34% diversification effect. So in that. regard, the numbers haven't changed drastically.. Here, the history of this is, I want to remind you where we are coming from. We felt very. happy with the 220% in 2015. Already, we have defined our threshold at 200% and our. the growth we are slightly down again. But I think also, this graph should show you that we. are at a a very comfortable situation today as well. Here is the translation between IFRS. and Solvency II, if we go, you know the criteria or the aspects, which changes here. We. have some adjustments of the assets where we, of course, according to Solvency II, don't. have any hold to maturity or amortized cost assets. I think there is no need to go through. that.. Here, the second column on the right hand side shows you that there is room for EUR1.4. billion in hybrid capital, that would also count as Standard and Poor's or AM Best capital. So. in that regard, if we ever come under pressure from the solvency ratio where we are far. away from, we had -- we would have ways and means to get that even more. comfortable, again.. I think with that slide, as always, leaves the target metrics to Ulrich.. Ulrich Wallin. Thank you, Roland. Yeah, that brings us to the target metrics and you can see we have. mostly takes that reflects very good 2018 result. To take the missing, one is the EBIT, sorry. -- EBIT, all the Group targets have been met, but the combined ratio is slightly above our. target, well, that has to do of course, with the losses, it also has to do with the. component of the advanced solutions business, so the structured business where we. increased the target to 97%, not because of this, but because of the composition of the. business.. The other one is the IVC, on the Life & Health side, and this still has to do with the U.S.. mortality business because whilst we were happy with most of the business that was. recaptured, we weren't happy with all of that business because also some actually quite. profitable business was recaptured. That was included in the technical provisions as. reducing the technical provisions because we were expecting future positive cash flows.. So they came out and had a negative effect on the economic earnings, so to say and that. also had negative effect on the solvency ratio. But the good thing, nothing offset has to. Then coming to next year, or this year, again the quite positive look at 2019 and that's not. only myself, but the entire Executive Board and management of Hannover Re. On the. reason for that is the rather disappointing returns of some of the market players. It's not. rate increases. I would say, that the quality of the 2019 fiscal year from a rating. still, I would say, soft market pricing but slightly improving.. Overall as a result, we expect on the combined ratio, at least in our planning, slight. improvement in 2019 compared to 2018, but from a basic quality of the business, certainly. that we see in the market and Board assumes that on the P&C side, the business should. pretty much track what we had seen in 2018. You can see that in this market environment,. we're able to continue to to grow profitably, particular growth in North America and. Continental Europe, both -- particularly in the North America we see rate increases also on. the primary insurance side. So on both of those segments, we expect good profitability.. We also grew in the wide reinsurance and this is largely growth from Asia and to some. extent, Latin America and from Asia and particular China, where we have seen very, very. significant growth.. Specialty lines, mixed picture, I mean Marine Credit and Surety, we expect continued. good profitability, Aviation, we always put us negative because the rates are so low that. you can hardly see them, development is positive I mean we see increases there. But as I. still remember, a lot higher rates (inaudible) negative. But you might say it's not very well. borne out by the combined ratios we are seeing in that business. But as Roland rightly. said, it's a relatively small part of the business.. If you go to the Life & Health, that's where we expect the growth and profitability coming. from is this year. Main reason is the U.S. mortality business, though the impact on the. results will be significantly below what we have seen in 2018 and 2017 where in each of. those years, the result of our business that we acquired from from Scottish Re in. that for the current year, we come down significantly because lot of the business has. gone through recaptures. We are expecting to see here result which is say, middle double. digit US dollar negative result. But still a little bit up and downs, the mortality is still. somewhat somewhat volatile, but the impact will be a lot less.. The mortality business outside that block is actually performing quite well. That's. particularly true outside the U.S., but also our U.S. what we call the organic, our new. business, provides us with increasing and good profitability. So overall, we expect the. mortality solutions business on a whole to get back into into profitable territory.. On the morbidity business, we have significant growth, in particular in Asia, it's a lot of. critical illness business. The business is not quite as profitable in and large as the mortality. business when it worked as expected, but it is shorter term and is actually I mean, more. than sufficient to cover the cost of capital.. Longevity, due to very conservative reserving the overall profits, the next few years will. not be that exciting, but say four years to five years from now, we should see increasing. profitability because, then the blocks are aging to a level in particular in the U.S., the -- I. mean, mortality improvement that we calculated in may not materialize to the full extent,. which would then give us positive extra to expected results. The star will again be the. financial solutions business. We expect growing profitability there, very profitable book in. the U.S., but we grow that business also in Asia to quite some extent now. And we will see. that the profitability from that business grow client remarkably in 2019.. If you sum that all up, come to the guidance of 2019, we haven't changed that at all, I. mean the premium target growth, we are relatively confident that that should be. achievable. We had rather good on the P&C side, rather good 1/1 renewal. We grew 15.4%. the renewed business. (inaudible) is shaping up quite nicely as well. So the growth should. be fine, Life & Health grows a little bit less, but also there, we see increases in premium,. particularly in Asia. We see some, of course decreases in premium, continued decreases. in premium in the U.S., due to the recapture, of course, all the recaptured future. premiums. Nonetheless, we see that positive and we grow on the financials solutions side. in the U.S., but most of that is deposit accounted. I mean, you have seen on the numbers. that Roland showed you that the other income and expense line on the Life & Health. business has become is a really significant profit contributor. But it's a little bit unusual,. because normally you have the expenses for the company as a whole in there, back to. due to the deposit accounted business, that has become really a profit engine for our Life. & Health business.. For our investment, we expect a solid result, we haven't planned any extra lift, but the 2 -more than 2.0% or at least 2.8% should be achievable provided that the capital markets. do not see any dislocation beyond what we had seen in the last few years. And then of. course, the net income, we expect in the region of EUR1.1 billion. I mean, I would see it. should be around EUR1.1 billion, but provided that the loss --- large losses status in the. budget are not much more than the budget and we see no dislocation of the of the. capital market, this region should not be symmetric, so it should be a little bit -- have. more leeway to the ups to the down, I would say. But what it should really show you that. we expect the growth in the profitability in 2019 as compared to 2018.. Dividend, provided that we get the results that we are guiding for and provided that the. capital ratio, the solvency ratio stays above the -- I would say, 210% to 220% level, clearly. the dividend that the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Hannover Re will. suggest or they recommend to the AGM of Hannover Re for 2018 of EUR5.25 per share, it. is clearly the benchmark for the dividend in 2019.. With that, summing it up, we believe that we, on the P&C side, are in the position to. continuously outperform the market. We feel that we have a strong competitive position. and have a clearly low expense ratio than our competition. On the life and health side, we. are seeing growing profitability, as I explained and expect a solid result on the. investments, that is for 2019 and should also give the trend for the medium term.. With that, thank you very much for listening. And we will be more than happy to answer. your questions.. Questions And Answers. Unidentified Speaker. Well, thank you. We will now begin with our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions). We shall proceed first with the questions from attendees in this room and then move on. some hands up, we start with Kamran and continue with Andrew Ritchie.. Kamran Hossain. little bit about, do you think your own targets are too conservative? So when we look at. EUR1.1 billion or around EUR1.1 billion for this year, this feels conservative, so that's the first. question.. And the second question is, coming back to something that was at the beginning of the. presentation, you talked about undefendable reserves where you've been forced to. release them. Could you maybe talk a little bit about two pockets; one is, I guess in the. UK, again the continuous mortality improvement group today has reduced life expectancy. assumptions six months (inaudible) and the second pocket is (inaudible) we've seen a. couple of the big (inaudible) hold that assumption to zero. So what is the trigger points for. saying this coming through into earnings? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Well, thank you for those questions. Well, I mean you might say that the forecast is. conservative, but I think it's not much more conservative than we had in previous years.. And yes, I mean, it should basically, I mean the main things that we want to say is that we. see profits rising. I mean, there's always so many things happening throughout the year. that, I mean we're never overly bullish with these numbers, I would say.. Undefendable reserves, I mean, on the UK motility improvements, on our pension blocks,. they're clearly defendable, because we have the lock in principle. So any improvements. will only show when there is positive development extra to expect it, we cannot use that. in -- I mean, letting it go through IFRS earnings. If you change the technical provisions on. the Solvency II in that respect, we can of course do that if it's well-founded as that would. then increase the solvency ratio. It will also increases the IVC, then of course. Then the. (inaudible) that could become undefendable, because all the case reserves we currently. reserve at the minus 0.75% and that's a pretty large number, by now from some of our. clients, we get, I mean loss advises although alternatively with zero or even 1%, but we are. not using these on -- for case reserving purposes. So should we really see an increase in. the (inaudible) raise is then of course these case reserves will come down and we will just. have to release them, I mean it's not a lot we can do there.. Roland Vogel. Kamran, if I may add to this, too conservative, I'm not sure as to whether you were. referring to the 900 basis points in the ROE achievements or the absolute guidance,. which we gave. To the first point, and we have heard that question before. So if your. outperformance, your hurdle all the time, why don't you just increase it and make your. company even more profitable? The one thing you should really bear in mind is that these. targets are really cascaded down to each and every -- to a contract pricing level. And if. we, for instance, would say, we increased our hurdle from 900 basis points to 1200 basis. points, that would mean that we no longer write the business, which provides 1000 basis. points.. So now it comes back to the investors and your requirements, how much do you require. of us? Do you want us to write that business? Because we are not paying dividends out of. percentages in ROI -- ROEs, ee are paying that from euros. So in that regard, you might. be happy to receive the euros, which we make from all these contracts which only, in. quotes, provides 950 basis points. So this is really a sophisticated system. And if we take. decisions here, they have impacts which might sound great to present it to you, but it. really has an internal meaning also for the pricing.. Unidentified Speaker. Okay, Andrew?. Hi. So, Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. For Roland, first of all, looking at the ROI, for the. last couple of years, the returns on private equity have been seemingly exceptional, I. mean, at nearly 20%, if I just look at the income compared to the private equity asset. base. I think real estate is 8% or 9% for the last couple of years, I appreciate those growth. of expenses. Those just seem unsustainably high. But why are they so strong? And I mean. presumably, it's part of your guidance that we shouldn't extrapolate those.. And I guess a question, it's early, I mean you changed your chart record, what have you. left for the -- your successor to address? Is there -- are you leaving any notes in the desk. drawer of things to look at? Is there any, again, one maybe one or two items that you felt. you maybe you'd like to have done better more? I'm not sure, something like that?. Roland Vogel. Should I start? ROIs, with regard to the real estate portfolio, here I am really convinced. that this is sustainable. We always mentioned and indicated, look this gross number in the. ordinary income is to some extent it inflated. So -- and the expenses go down, so here, a. 6% for the portfolio, which we have on a net basis, which we had in the previous years as. well. I think we see that as sustainable. We -- that portfolio developed really well. My. colleagues very often asked me, so if that is so profitable, why don't you buy more of. that? That is exactly the thing, it is a high quality, single-building policy, we look at every. building, as such, we've increased the universe to also include Asia now. So in that regard,. I'm really comfortable.. Bit more complicated on the private equity side, you mentioned the kind of excessive. margins which we made, they were driven in the last years and years '16 and '17 in. particular, where some of the funds did extra distributions, plus our IFRS accounting,. where we did not fully account for those profits, which were retained at some funds,. there was an argument as to whether according to IFRS you look into that or not, there. were some extraordinary items. 2018 was rather free. There were some smaller. distributions, but that was not in a real major extraordinary level of private equity. We are. in the double-digits and we feel comfortable that we stay there. Also there, there might. be a market development, but what we have seen, it's very mature, we are a portfolio. which of course renews once in a while, 2%, that means nearly EUR1 billion, which we have. there and continue to have there. So also here of course this is private equity, you don't. get double-digit returns risk-free, there is no free lunch but there's no reason to really. assume that apart from major capital market developments, that this should not continue.. Ulrich Wallin. And I mean for my successor, there is lots of things to do, I mean we have of course our. digitalization initiatives, which is of course improving internal processes, improving. underwriting by better use of data, and I would say, I mean there is quite a lot of. developments that we can do in the future. And I'm sure we will and at the leadership of. Jean-Jacques.. There's also of course some business relationships with clients around the world, it's. definitely room for improvement, It's also of course readjusting the level of service we are. providing our clients in order to produce business. So there's a lot of things to do, I mean,. and it's of course always challenging and it's a lot easier to say well, that's a piece of cake. when you're not having to do it. Looks a lot more challenging when you have to do it, as I. know. But there's lots of things, and one thing is of course the most important, not doing. too expensive mistakes. I mean, making small mistakes, that's fine because you have to. do it, if you make no mistakes, you're not doing anything, but mistakes like buying a. clearing or buying a Scottish re portfolio, if you can, avoid do it, because It has two. negative effects on it. I mean, of course, it takes out some of the financial strength of the. of the Company, but it also, I mean, takes a lot of management attention. I can tell you, I. know a lot more about the U.S. mortality business than I ever wanted to know.. Unidentified Speaker. We continue to stay on the site with Vinit.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you, Vinit from Mediobanca. So three, if I may for now. Just on the reserving, first. point. So, I noticed that you said that there is $100 million to $200 million extraordinary. reserve releases in '18, there were case reserves, which you said you just could not. release. So that should, in theory, not damage or not reduce the confidence interval at all,. because they're not needed. So if you could clarify that aspect of reserving? And should I. go to second question, now?. Second question is just on the SCR increase and I have tried in my head some rough. attempts at figuring out how the EUR1.2 billion of premiums increase led to such a big. EUR400 million odd increase, there must have been diversification, and secondly,. structured solutions, by definition, as we understand is a low capital requirement business.. So those concepts are not adding up at all. Maybe you could help us in breaking up the. growth versus investment risk or any other risks? And there is one-third diversification as a. sort of standard also, so it's not adding up.. Sorry, just last question, sorry. So the new business value of life. So also, Ulrich, I noticed. that you said China, critical illness is not that profitable. Maybe this is dragging this down a. bit. What is the 220% is supposed to achieve because the way we understood always. from the outside is that new business is fantastic. That will override the problems of the. back book of U.S. mortality et cetera, et cetera. So what if you did achieve 220%, is that. level at which it offsets any back book or what -- how should we interpret because you. said, the only thing good about that chart was it was better than 220%, otherwise it was. very low. So, thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. I mean, first of all, you understood me wrong on the critical illness business from China,. we actually think that is actually quite profitable. However, what we have on that is what. we called soft guarantees. So we are not guarantee the rates for the lifetime of the. policy, but only for five for 10 years. That means that for us, for calculating the value of. new business, it take only the guarantee, again, the guarantee period into account. So we. only guarantee the rates for five years, we only calculate the expected profit for the next. five years, we're not going up going beyond that despite the fact that these treaties. would normally -- because of policies, would continue beyond that. That of course. reduces the value of new business.. The other thing is on the U.S., the UK and Canada, we have increased following the. experience with the (inaudible) portfolio, we have increased our rates on the permanent. business, not that significant but sufficiently significant to become uncompetitive, so we. are not having that business. Of course, if you have the permanent business, which is like. whole of life business sold at the age of say, 35. I mean, you have a tail on that business is. easily six years. So if you just calculate that with the assumption at the time of. underwriting, you expect positive contributions for the next 60 years, which of course. makes relatively large value of new business. It's also of course subject to a lot of risk. because of the mortality assumptions have to be changed downwards and of course that. value of new business can evaporate rather quickly.. The 220%, I mean if you make the 220% and have a neutral development of the technical. provisions of the back years, due to the roll forward, that would means that we achieve -certainly -- that we certainly outperform our level of IVC, of the xRoCA, I mean, we are. then significantly over and above the 2% xRoCA level. That's why we have it, I mean what. that does then on IFRS is a little bit more difficult to say because that really depends how. you account the future profits in IFRS and how the profits emerge, I mean, as they're. normally a little bit back loaded. So that's a little bit more difficult to tell. Also, of course on. the IFRS profitability, not an insignificant part of that also comes from kind of short-tailed. health business, which of course has no value of new business, because a lot of that is. actually single-year business.. I mean on the SCR, of course, we have an increase due to the spread increase because. that's the year end, we had a significant increase in the credit spread. that means that we. assume a higher volatility. So that increases, that spread increase increases the SCR. Of. course, the growth in the business, including some growth also in the cap business. increased the SCR as well. And then, one has to say that the internal model is not static. I. mean it has model changes all the time, minor model changes, but they also have an. effect. So it's not that easy to calculate the effects from, say 31st of December '17 to 31st. of December, it's not such a simple calculation, I have to say, but I guess my colleagues. may be more than happy to explain that maybe, our Chief Risk Officer to give you that. maybe at the next Investor Day, I think it's -- because it takes a little bit longer time and. deliver more data I have available here. But at least, I mean in general, one can say that. the increase in business and the increase in spread has driven that of growth of the SCR.. Then on the reserving role, and I hand that over to you.. Roland Vogel. Yeah, Vinit, as I think you have a right point, this is why I indicated that there is some. uncertainty and also that three different actuarial parties did not really come to the same. result. It is well, if we, for a special segment, calculate with actuarial models that the best. estimate point for the ultimate loss ratio is 90%, we reserve it at 96%, then we have a 6%. redundancy level, if then we decide, over -- maybe we have a little bit of a pressure, let's. go down to 94%, then the math is easy to tell, look as this was an extraordinary. downward take of the large -- of the reserve redundancies, easy to say that or to. calculate it. It's a bit more complicated that you have, in a line of business, a certain. redundancy level and then case reserves, which you are totally right. If that is a pure case. reserve, one should assume, if we take it out, nothing happens to redundancy because. it's just in and out. Still, the ultimate loss ratio calculation depends on the incurred case. reserves for the actuarial model lying beneath that.. So in that regard, and this is why I was a little bit hesitant and I was mentioning the. uncertainty for the EUR100 million to EUR200 million because exactly that what you. mentioned is right, it is not too easy to now determine the exact decrease. And as we. would then say look, EUR100 million to EUR200 million, that is what we expect the reserve. redundancy to go down, that exactly that point defines the uncertainty, which I was trying. to indicate also with a wide range.. Ulrich Wallin. I'd be getting a little bit of comfort by the fact that the overall level of reserves have. actually increased in line with the increasing premiums. So we have about too big and. more reserves at the end of 2018 than we had at the end of 2017.. Unidentified Speaker. Okay. We continue on the site with Thomas Fossard.. Thomas Fossard. Yes, good afternoon. I've got two questions. The first one would be on the '19 full-year. guidance. I think that couple of months ago -- weeks ago, you indicated that is in the. region of EUR1.1 billion, was based on the assumption that the life business in '19 will be. around EUR400 million of EBIT. Now looking at the numbers and adjusted for the specific. item of the (inaudible) process, we're starting with EUR460 million in '18. So why the. EUR460 million will not be the right base to think about the '19 EBIT contribution on the life. side, even if you got EUR20 million to EUR50 million of additional recapture, we should. expect some of growth in the business, and obviously you've got some relatively positive. outlook. So, why EUR400 million is the right number?. And the second question would be really to P&C. And just to share, if you got some, I. would say, a better news on how the 1\4 renewals could evolve for your business in terms. of volumes and in terms of pricing you're expecting? Thank you.. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah, of course on Life & Health side, I mean you missed a prediction because I said at. the end of 2016 that we would have more than EUR350 million of EBIT in 2017, which then. didn't come through, so -- because of unexpected spike in mortality. So we are a little bit. cautious on those predictions and therefore, I mean, we are happy with the EUR400. million for the time being. I mean, we would not be unhappy if it's more, but I think I was. hesitant to predict that.. On the P&C 1/4, of course we will report in detail with the first quarter. So far it's shaping. up quite well, but it's relatively late renewal, because I mean, reinsurers try to get higher. prices and ceding companies look at their options and of course, see if they can come to. terms with that. But overall, I mean, so far, it looks, I mean, moderately good, I would say.. Unidentified Speaker. So I think we move to the other side, to Bill Hawkins.. Bill Hawkins. Thank you. Bill Hawkins from KBW. Three questions. I hope they're all quick. You touched. on this briefly, I think with Vinit, but on Slide 25, could you try and give us an indication of. what you think is the operating change of own funds in SCL and also Solvency II ratio, so if. we (inaudible) market movements and model noise and other stuff ?. And then secondly, again I appreciate you touched on this in other quarters, but now that. we've seen the full year, can you just remind us about why there is a widening gap. between your gross and net losses in terms of large losses. So the gross figure is down. EUR100 million, the net figure is down EUR300 million. And I guess more importantly,. you've already spoken in the past comfortably about this, but are you not concerned that. at some point there is going to be some reasonable payback hits that you're going to. have to take even if that doesn't come in 2019, because you've already done a lot of. renewals.. And then lastly, given that you now have seven years of special dividend, is there ever. going to come a point when you should just rebase the ordinary dividend and on the one. hand, I appreciate that is just kind of noise we know what the total number is, but on the. other hand, maintaining the special does kind of communicate some level of uncertainty. about capital flexibility or growth or sustainability of profits, none of which appear to be. concerns when you're talking, so why don't just have a higher ordinary dividend?. Ulrich Wallin. Yeah. Starting from the back, because if I may, I mean we already have increased the. ordinary dividend and of course, we will continue to do that, not the 35% to 45%, which. we already had increased to 45% and we'd probably be closer to the 45% that will come,. I'm pretty sure. We would still then, for capital management, maybe at extraordinary, at. least in the immediate future. Then on the -- why is the difference between gross and net. increasing? Well, I mean our -- the losses that we had in 2018 fitted our retro program a. little bit better than what we had seen in 2017. Also we had changed the aggregate, the. retro program to buy more aggregate cover, which of course in a year like 2018, where. you had so many medium-size large losses, which are adding up was quite helpful also, I. mean, the (inaudible) transaction of course has a quota share in a year where you have a. lot of frequency is actually quite helpful.. Pricing, well payback, yeah, I mean we understand the concept of payback, I mean there is. of course, on our main whole account cover, there's still a very healthy credit balance for. our retrocession, hence for 2019, we didn't get much of an increase actually, our. department buying the cover would argue risk adjusted, maybe, they even got a. decrease, but I mean, then of course they want to be successful. I would say in general, I. mean, if we see significant reduction in retro cover and significant higher prices there, we. think that that would filter through to the reinsurance pricing, which would then allow us to. increase our retention of the business at better prices. We would of course always offer. our retrocession as renewal, that's why we decided to do so, but of course only at a. reasonable price.. And then of course also -- we also have the ability -- P&C business is largely annual. business that coincides with the renewal dates of our protections. We of course also have. the opportunity, I mean, to reduce our growth lines, if that is necessary to be in line with. our risk appetite. But I mean, with that -- we are not so concerned. I mean, if you get more. -- better rate then on the reinsurance side, we don't mind, I mean, increasing, say, as a. deductible of our retrocessions and even pay a bit more. As long as we get more through. the front doors, that's not too much of a problem.. Then on the SCR, how much is operational, how much is extraordinary through spreads? I. would like to say that we would have to, I mean, give you that later in writing, because I'd. rather not want to speculate on that one.. Roland Vogel. Okay. I -- please -- please, apologize or understand that we gave also our team more. time to provide the Solvency II reporting. This will change next year. We have outside. requirements to provide even before that. The SCR the SFCR will be produced, we will. publish those numbers. We came with preliminary numbers, so we just ask you for a little. bit of patience, we will provide all that information in April.. Unidentified Speaker. Well, then we'll just continue with Paris.. Paris Hadjiantonis. Yes, thank you. Paris Hadjiantonis from Credit Suisse. So, my first question would be on. German GAAP earnings. If I look at the retained profits, plus the profit you have achieved. in 2018, your German GAAP is position currently covers more than 2 times your annual. dividends, which has been the case for last year as well. Is this a level that we should think. that you'll consider to be reasonable, or is it too high, is it too low, so a comment on that?. Second question would be on German government bonds. I think that over 2018, you. have more than doubled your positioning in German government bonds in your. investment portfolio, so that's substantially up. So, yes, could you please explain that?. And lastly, on financial leverage, you have talked about the EUR1.4 billion of unused hybrid. capacity that you have on your solvency position. Would you only increase your financial. leverage or would you only go out to the market and get an issue hybrid debt in the case. of your solvency ratio coming under strain or would you consider that for business growth. as well?.

35,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International. Conference Call on Q1 2020 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is. being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. JeanJacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call. presenting our results for the first quarter of 2020. First of all, I need to apologize for the. specific timing of this call and the overlap with Axel's [ph] Q1 call. But today is our AGM. and there was unfortunately no flexibility for rescheduling. We will also have to end our call. by 10:30 this morning as we need to go to the AGM thereafter.. As usual, I will start with an overview before our CFO, Roland Vogel, will go over the. financials in more detail. I'll then comment on the outlook for the year and for the Q&A, as. usual, I'm additionally joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.. In the first quarter of 2020, Hannover Re was able to grow both its top and bottom line. with a net income of EUR301 million, fully in line with our initial profit guidance for the year. of EUR1.2 billion.. However, you all know that we withdrew our full-year guidance just 2 weeks ago due to. the prevailing uncertainty surrounding both the claims development and the capital. market environment. Therefore, the results for the first quarter cannot be used to draw. conclusions about the full year. But purely looking at the underlying business. development, I'd still say that we had a good start to the year. This is also confirmed by. the return on equity of 11.5%, which is well above our minimum target.. In P&C reinsurance, we saw double-digit premium growth due to increased demand for. reinsurance. The combined ratio of 99.8% was above our target of 97%, and this can. entirely be explained by the decision to reserve for anticipated Coronavirus related. losses, mainly in the area of business interruption, event cancellation, as well as credit and. surety. In total, we reserved EUR220 million, implying that our large loss budget was. exceeded by around EUR100 million.. The results of our Life & Health Reinsurance business group was not impacted by the. Coronavirus pandemic to-date. The EBIT of EUR124 million is quite favorable. The US. mortality experience was in line with expectations. And also in general, the good result did. not include any material extraordinary effects.. At 3.2%, the return on investment is similarly pleasing. And finally, based on preliminary. calculations, the solvency ratio should be within the range of 220% to 230% at the end of. the first quarter, well above our threshold of 200%, despite the considerable volatility in. interest rates and credit spreads.. The operating cash flow in the first quarter was particularly strong, driven by attractive. reinsurance growth as well as very solid results on the investment side. However, total. assets under own management only increased very slightly to EUR47.9 billion Q2 due to. mitigating effect from decreasing valuation reserves and currency translation.. Looking at our capital position, shareholders' equity was almost stable. Market. movements had a strong impact in the first quarter and the negative change in unrealized. gains due to significantly increased credit spreads was the -- stronger than the positive. impact from the decrease in interest rates. Therefore on balance, the unrealized gains. within the OCI decreased by EUR379 million, more than offsetting the positive net income. for the first quarter. The composition of the total capital on the left side of the slide is. unchanged, with a high degree of flexibility around the hybrid bucket.. On that note, I'd like to hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain the figures in more. detail.. Roland Vogel. Good morning, and thank you, Jean-Jacques. Moving directly onto the segmental. reporting, I will start with the development of our P&C business group. Gross written. premium grew by 12%. Adjusted for currency effects, this growth came in well diversified. by region and line of business and more pronounced in property than in casualty. The. Americas and the APAC region contributed particularly to this growth, while structured. reinsurance remained on the high level of the previous year.. The large loss situation in the first quarter was two-fold. On the one hand, the -- I would. call it normal, large loss experience was rather benign; on the other hand, we had to deal. with a high degree of uncertainty around the impact from the Coronavirus pandemic with. almost no claims notifications received for our clients. However, based on our own. assessment of potential impacts from the Coronavirus pandemic, we set aside around. EUR220 million in IBNR reserves for expected losses from the pandemic.. These reserves are really across our book, mainly for expected losses from business. interruption, event cancellation cases as well as credit and surety reinsurance. As a result. of this reserving for Corona related claims expectations, the large loss budget for the first. quarter was exceeded by EUR96 million, which accounts for roughly 3 combined ratio. points. And adjusting the 99.8%, reported combined ratio for this budget over-run, the. figure would have been in line with our 97% combined ratio target.. Based on the development of a variety of single [ph] cases, the run-off of reserves was. slightly negative in the first quarter. Overall, we have to assume that the balance of our. reserve developments, including conservative initial underwriting year combined ratios,. led to a confidence level rather in line with the year-end 2019, but we also did not have. the chance to increase it after the year-end reduction.. The net investment income increased strongly, driven by higher realized gains, we will. come to that, in addition to the favorable ordinary investment income. Other income. expenses were positive by EUR11 million, mainly driven by positive currency effects. And. altogether, the EBIT margin is slightly below our 10% target to -- due to the decreased. underwriting results. Finally, the tax ratio is slightly above the normal level but this is within. the normal quarterly volatility.. Total large -- net large losses including Corona related claims accounted for EUR284. million in the first quarter, exceeding the budget by the already mentioned EUR96 million.. The EUR220 million provisions for the Coronavirus complex is included in both the gross. and the net numbers, as we have exceeded our estimates cost [ph] for net.. Our large loss list includes four events in the area of natural catastrophes, namely three. weather related events in Australia and Storm Sabine, also known as Ciara in Europe. We. did not actually record any large manmade losses exceeding our EUR10 million threshold. in the first quarter. The net CAT losses added up to EUR63.6 million, which would have. been very benign in comparison to our Q1 budget of EUR188 million. However, in the end. the budget was exceeded by the approximately EUR100 million mentioned various times. already.. The next slide shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business according to. our new reporting lines. Here the regional split is a little bit more condensed and including. the network -- catastrophe components of such reasons to no longer artificially take that. out. The various lines of business are shown on a worldwide basis, albeit [ph] more. consequently.. Looking at the numbers for the first quarter, the impact from the large losses and the. additional reserving for the Coronavirus led to an increase in the combined ratios in all. regional markets. Not surprisingly, the most visible effect is on our credit and surety. business where we expect to see increased loss activity due to the impact of the. economic downturn. The agricultural business was affected by the bush fires in Australia.. And overall, as already mentioned, the ratio -- combined ratio stands at a rather high. 99.8%.. Let's move on to Life & Health. Growth was mainly driven by large -- by a large financing. treaty in Australia, which we wrote in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, this was. mitigated by the expected -- already expected reduction in premium volume due to the. effect from recaptures in our US mortality portfolio as a result of our management action. in the previous year.. Altogether, gross written premium increased by 0.5% adjusted for currency effect in. contrast to our P&C business group. The Life & Health results for the first quarter does. not include any impacts from the Coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, our US. mortality portfolio performed in line with expectations compared to a very favorable. experience in the first quarter of the previous year. On the other hand, the technical result. is not impacted by negative effects from Australian disability business in the way it was in. the previous year's first quarter.. Therefore, the underwriting result including funds withheld is on a comparable level to last. year. Ordinary investment income was favorable and also in Life & Health the contribution. from -- realized gains has contributed. The credit spread widening impacted the value of. our ModCo derivative. The effect was around minus EUR27 million. However, other. derivatives contributed very positively to the change in fair value through P&L and thereby. compensating for the ModCo impact.. Other income and expense is mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution from. financial solutions business, for which a large portion is recognized according to the deficit. [ph] -- the accounting deficit. Currency effects in this quarter, slightly negative, although -altogether, the EBIT of EUR124 million does not include any material extraordinary effects. and demonstrates a good underlying profitability of the Life & Health business group. At. 10.5%, the tax ratio is below the normal level, mainly due to very good results from. subsidiaries and jurisdictions with a low tax rate.. On the next slide, the development of our investments in the first quarter of 2020 was. very satisfactory. I'm particularly pleased with the strong ordinary investment income,. which was rather stable this -- by the somewhat lower contribution from private equity.. Realized gains of around EUR100 million are coming mainly from our fixed income. portfolio. Apart from the normal portfolio turnover, we sold around EUR0.5 billion in lower. quality credits before the crisis actually started. And at the time, almost all sales within our. fixed income portfolio were associated with realized gains. Impairments and. depreciations were above last year, but still on a very low level.. As I already explained, the main effect within the change in fair value of financial. instruments, here the negative effect from ModCo was more than offset by other. derivatives. Altogether the ROI was very strong at 3.2%. Realized gains decreased. significantly to EUR1.8 billion, mainly driven by higher corporate spreads.. On the next slide, you can see that on the other hand we have slightly reduced -- on the. one hand we have slightly reduced our corporate bond exposure, in particular within our. US SME portfolio, on the other hand the share of government as well as short-term. investments in cash were slightly increased, reflective -- reflecting our passive derisking. approached with new money currently being invested in risk free assets.. Finally, the price corrections on the stock markets in March was a trigger event for our. investment committee to look at, whether we should re-enter listed equities. Owing to. the current uncertainty, we decided to start with a buy of around EUR250 million, a careful. and moderate step, that portfolio has developed positively after we bought it. The. contribution to ordinary investment income is diversified as usual, this time with a lower. share from private equity. This should not be surprising in the current market environment. and is expected to remain the case in the currently distressed markets.. The next slide, here we have included this one because the Coronavirus and the. economic downturn have put the asset risk and in particular corporate portfolios in the. spotlight. As you can see, our corporate portfolio is highly diversified by sector, within. those sectors additionally by issuer as we have rather strict limit control by issuer. implemented, the exposure to the energy sector which may be impacted by the low oil. price is around EUR700 million. The exposure to other sectors such as retail, travel,. leisure, hotel and Airlines, which may be directly impacted by the current crisis, was. around EUR500 million in total, again on a very well-diversified basis.. Having said that, on the asset side it is similar -- it is similarly too early to make any reliable. estimates as regards where and to what extend we might see defaults or impairments.. We certainly expect some, but the amount is highly dependent on the severity and the. duration of the economic downturn and the effectiveness of potentially mitigating. government measures.. I think this concludes my remarks, and I would like to hand back to you, Jean-Jacques.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Roland. As you know, we withdrew our profit guidance on the 21st of April due. to the uncertain impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. However, we're still showing you. our target metrics with the initial targets for 2020 to allow for an assessment of the. results for the first quarter.. On the positive side, the return on investments is very strong at 3.5% adjusted for the. impact from our ModCo derivative, the return on equity and also our capitalization. according to Solvency II are both comfortably above our minimum target. In P&C, the first. impact from the reserving for Coronavirus related losses is visible and in Life & Health the. overall results and also the earnings growth were favorable in the first quarter.. The treaty renewals as at 1st of April, 2020 were successful for Hannover Re, confirming. that the Coronavirus crisis is not materially affecting us from an operational perspective.. On this date, we traditionally renegotiate our business in Japan as well as on a lesser. scale in Australia, New Zealand, some Asian markets and North America.. In the US, we mainly expanded our property business based on increasing primary rates. and improved pricing in non-proportional business. Additionally, the renewals in the. Caribbean and South America were successful. In Japan, we saw rate increases for loss. affected CAT business that were significant, with improvements of plus 40% to plus 60%.. However, after the heavy loss burden in the last 2 years, we still feel that terms and. conditions need to further improve and hence we decided to simply maintain our market. share in that segment.. Positive trend could also be observed in our aviation and marine portfolio and overall, our. premium in the April renewal increased by 25%. The risk adjusted price change was plus. 4.4%. And looking only at the non-proportional business, the price increase was 8.3%.. On the next slide, we have put together our current assumptions for the impact of the. Coronavirus pandemic. Overall, the high degree of uncertainty around the claims. development and the capital market impact do not allow us to quantify the impact on our. financials. Therefore, we can only focus on qualitative comments at this point in time.. In P&C, we expect a direct impact on coverage of event cancellation and business. interruption while second order effects are possible in casualty lines. Also, we're. expecting that the economic downturn will result in insolvencies, Roland mentioned it. already, which would lead to losses in our credit and surety business as well.. In Life & Health, we believe the impact on mortality and morbidity will not be significant, an. assumption that is also supported by our scenario analysis and stress testing. The main. impact on our investments is the risk of impairments, as already mentioned, and reduction. in ordinary investment income. Otherwise, we feel that we have a high quality investment. portfolio, and to complete the picture the market movements and in particular the spread. widening are expected to negatively impact our capitalization but not to an extent that. would bring our solvency ratio below our 200% threshold in the year 2020. Therefore, we. also intend to maintain our general dividend policy.. Based on the favorable renewals at 1/1 and 1/4, we see further growth opportunities in. 2020 in most areas of our diversified P&C reinsurance portfolio even though the. Coronavirus prices is expected to moderately impact our growth rate later in the year. On. the positive side, we would expect that the crisis will support further improvements in. reinsurance market conditions. And additionally, we would expect to see some. opportunities for our structured reinsurance business. In general, highly rated reinsurers. with a strong balance sheet like Hannover Re, may see higher demand than the average. market players these days.. Usually, we also show the indication for the profitability versus cost of capital on this slide.. However, one reason for withdrawing the profit guidance was the uncertainty regarding. the claims development from the Coronavirus pandemic and hence, we're currently not. yet in a position to provide an update on the profitability data.. The same is true for our Life & Health outlook, we did not see any material impact from. the Coronavirus pandemic in the Q1 results. However, we also cannot rule out moderate. negative effect on our mortality and morbidity business, depending on the further. development of the pandemic.. In longevity, some positive effects might be possible, but this is still uncertain. And we also. expect continued strong profitability in Financial Solutions because the business is risk. remote. In Financial Solutions, we might also see additional demand to support clients in. mitigating the impact of the crisis. Apart from this, we see particularly promising growth. potential in the Asian market beyond the crisis.. Overall, I see the Hannover Re Group well positioned to manage and absorb the impact. of the Coronavirus crisis. We're constantly updating our scenario calculations and we will. provide profit guidance again as soon as the underlying probabilities are sufficiently. reliable.. This concludes my remarks on the outlook, and we would be happy to answer your. questions.. Questions And Answers. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator. Instructions). And the first question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous Research. Your. line is now open. Please go ahead.. Andrew Ritchie. Hi there, good morning. I hope all are keeping well. I guess my main question was just to. get a sense of your view on market conditions and how market conditions may change,. both from an opportunity to write more business and broad pricing. We've already seen. quite a few primary companies go into the market to buy more reinsurance already. So,. maybe just your perspective on would you expect to see, for example, already some. change in market conditions relative to what you were expecting before as early as the. mid-year renewals?. And the second question, just remind us how you would treat your -- any revaluation of. private equity? Does that -- when would you do that? Is that at your discretion? Just some. sensitivities around the private equity portfolio will be useful. Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take -- start with the first question and Sven might complement if. needed, and Roland will talk about private equity. Generally, we don't -- we didn't really. identify Coronavirus specific changes during the 1/4 renewal although it's very difficult to. assess. But my sense is that based on client feedback, broker feedback, that there is a. flight to quality, there is increased scrutiny from the buyers on capitalization level. And I. can see some opportunities for changes in the sense of increased shares on programs. for a company like ours and possibly also less capacity -- desirable capacity, if you want,. for the 1/7 renewals already and beyond, probably more marked in the 1st of January 2021. renewals, but I believe that the hardening of market conditions, which is already fueled by. NatCat events in the past few years will be strengthened and there'll be momentum in. the reinsurance market.. In terms of opportunities for me, I mentioned it briefly in the introduction, I feel that. structured reinsurance is the one area where we might have a good upside. We don't. have specific demand right now but a lot of questions asked by our customers on options,. on structured, and you can feel very much that all clients are looking at the wide range of. options to derisk and reinsurance comes among the prime options for our speed [ph]. So,. I also see there opportunities for growth. So both pricing and flight [ph] to quality and. structured reinsurance will create momentum in my view in reinsurance.. On private equity?. Roland Vogel. I'm happy to take that, Andrew. We -- I think, we've mentioned before that of course the. valuation of the private equities is a little bit less pro cyclical than that of the listed equities. because you have these market values immediately. We are talking to managers and fund. managers to get new values. We should not forget that the private equity portfolio has. also value-wise performed very well. It does contribute significantly to the nearly EUR1.8. billion of reserves and -- valuation reserves that we have today. We will update -- of. course valuation will go down. This will have an impact on the OCI,. I do not foresee really write-offs to a material extent this year. Of course, it depends on. scenarios, but I don't see that. We have seen already -- and this is why we mentioned it. and that is also what we would expect for the running year, that distributions from these. funds and from the managers will decrease, so the usual outperformance of -- or the. contribution of private equity to the ordinary, this is something we do not expect for the. year. But from a valuation perspective, this should have an impact on our OCI to a. digestible extent.. Andrew Ritchie. Okay, thanks very much.. Operator. And the next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please. go ahead.. Vinit Malhotra. Good morning. Just -- thanks and just 2 questions from me please. One is the slide 20,. the Coronavirus, the IBNR has taken of EUR220 million for these 3 lines. Could you just. help us understand the risk on the knock-on a little bit? I mean we've heard of this. enhanced scope in US workers' compensation and I know that you've reduced your. premiums there but that's also non-proportional. And then, just how much of a risk or. uncertainty do you see relative to this EUR220 million from the knock-on effects? That's. really the question.. And second thing is just on the growth, in April -- it's quite a bit far ahead of some of the. renewals seen in the peer group, which are mid single digits really in terms of growth. Is it. mostly your difference is coming from more the US side or more specialty like aviation,. marine? Could you just help us quantify a little bit where you might be different from the. peers in this renewals? Thank you.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. I'll pass on these two questions to Sven.. Sven Althoff. Thank you and a very good morning also from my side. When it comes to the knock-on. effects, this has played a limited part in offsetting these EUR220 million of Corona. reserves. On the other hand, of course we have to be conscious that when it comes to. lines of business like the E&O where we have systemic risk out of insolvencies. And in the. end certain insolvency situations may be related to Corona impact, and therefore this is. one of the aspects where the uncertainty is particularly high and where we have we will. have better answers towards the end of the year. But we are watching this very carefully. like we are watching the credit and surety space very carefully. And it's not always easy to. decide whether an insolvency is Corona related or Corona was only one of the. contributors in what would have happened otherwise. So, I would not have a specific. number for you which part of the EUR220 million is taken care of the knock-on effects. But. as Roland has mentioned, this was very much a top-down view of how we see Corona in. general right now, and we have spent less time given the uncertainty on how we are. contributing those numbers across our business.. When it comes to the growth at the 1st of April renewal, quite a bit is driven by Japan.. Jean-Jacques already mentioned the very meaningful rate increases we have achieved on. has been a little different compared to a number of our peers. The focus from the peer. group was very much on the wind towers, but we said from the word go to our Japanese. client that, yes, we need to readjust the pricing on the wind towers but at the same time. we also understand that giving payback will be difficult for the client on the wind towers. only.. So, we had a much broader conversation with our Japanese client and that was very. successful. We received a lot of compliments after the renewal from our clients. And in. terms of payback, we have no not only achieved those cash increases which are very. much in line with the market, but we have also achieved additional non-CAT business from. our Japanese clients and we have also received well -- very well priced earthquakeexposed business from our Japanese client.. So, that was one of the main contributors for the very significant growth at 1/4. And the. other main contributor was the agricultural business where we have very successfully. negotiated one contract in the United States on the MPCI business on a quota share. basis. This is coming from a client that used to buy from us, then the client stopped to buy. from us and now that client is buying again. And that was the main contributor compared. to 1/1 as well.. Vinit Malhotra. Thank you.. Operator. And the next question is from Andreas Schafer, Bankhaus Lampe. Your line is now open.. Please go ahead.. Andreas Schaf er. Thank you. So there's just one question from my side left. On the asset side, I mean I was. surprised see that you're unrealized capital gains for non-fixed income assets have risen. quite strongly in Q1. So could you give us, especially on real estate, some sort of overview. about -- on your exposure, especially to retail investments, shopping center and so on?. And what do you expect here for the development of the value of your investments in. real estate?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. Overall, if we talk about real estate and the prices, the. portfolio as such has not changed dramatically. We sold one piece of real estate in the. first quarter with a good -- realized gains. So in that regard, the valuation reserves should. have gone down by that gain. Other than that, the portfolio has not changed a lot. So,. these are revaluations, the portfolio -- the real estate portfolio as such, comprises EUR2.6. billion including funds. Retail is really one of the smaller components in our direct holdings.. This is all commercial and within that the most of it is a focus on office buildings and we. have increased logistics, so retail is really a minor component of that.. Still also we have seen that some of our clients here -- and have stopped the payments of. their rents and we have been flexible in this regard. The impact, especially in the first. quarter of course, was limited. We expect a little bit more, but also again the real estate. portfolio is not driven by retail.. Andreas Schaf er. Thank you.. Operator. Please go ahead.. Vikram Gandhi. Hello, good morning. This is Vikram, SocGen. Just got one question, how should we think. about the EUR220 million charge on the COVID-related claims with respect to credit and. surety business? Have you already penciled in the more significant part of the claims that. you are -- that are likely to (Technical Difficulty) and likewise even on the event cancellation. claims or is there more to come? And how should we think of this EUR220 million with. regard to the initial EUR200 million potential exposure that you had provided to the. market? Thank you.. Roland Vogel. Thank you. Sven, I'll let you address this one as well.. Sven Althoff. Yeah, thank you. I mean, as you will appreciate, there is a very high amount of uncertainty. right now in coming up with a robust Corona reserve, for part of the uncertainty of course. comes from the fact that the event is still ongoing and we do not have a final view on. what will happen in the upcoming weeks. So therefore, we have tried to take a balanced. top site [ph] best estimate view.. On the credit and surety side, which was one of the specific parts of your questions, we. have of course 2008 as a reference case where roughly we had 15 to 20 loss ratio points,. more frequency coming during the financial crisis years out of our credit and surety book. of business. At the same time, we have very strong mitigating programs from. government in place or in negotiations right now, which did not happen in 2008.. I mean to take Germany as a specific example, the German Government has decided to. take a very, very significant quota share of the in-force German and export credit business. written by German companies for a less than proportionate part of the premium. And we. are aware that we have various European countries thinking about at least similar. concepts.. And these circumstances, as long as the programs from governments are not finally in. place, they are severely de-risking their portfolios. And therefore, we still feel, even. financial crisis recession in 2008 compared to a recession which is hitting the non-financial. our initial loss ratio. And Roland mentioned that when he commented on the slide where. side is conservative by adding roughly 25 to 30 loss ratio points in the first quarter based. on this line of business as well. Could you repeat just the second part of your question,. please?. Vikram Gandhi. Sure. The second part of the question was pretty much similar to credit and surety. Should. we think that you have also reserved a large (Technical Difficulty) of the event cancellation. claims that you anticipate?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Yes, even though -- again it was a top-down number we have established, this is taking. care of a very significant part of our event cancellation portfolio. As you know, we are one. of the three participants on the program for the 2020 or now 2021 Olympics. Our line on. the program is relatively small with only $50 million. So this number, even though we only. expect a partial loss on the Olympic program, is sitting comfortably into our overall. reserve.. Outside of the Olympics, we have a contingency in the event cancellation portfolio. But. that is in itself only a double-digit number we are currently associating with Corona. specific cancellations. So, I would say that we have been able in the first quarter to. reserve for most of that particular exposure.. Vikram Gandhi. Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.. Operator. remarks.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well, thank you very much for your question and interest. I think we've covered the ground. pretty well. We wanted to convey the message that we have a decent Q1 with material. reserving for these Corona related losses. At the same time, it's still early in the year and. we will follow development very carefully and we will be able to quantify more specifically. how the impact evolves. But generally, we feel confident, we feel well positioned, very. well capitalized to master this challenge, but also beyond that to capture new. opportunities, we mentioned that earlier during the question session. So, a good steady. performance with challenges ahead, but these are nevertheless, in our view, manageable.. We have our AGM, as you know, later today to present the results of 2019 and to. comment on Q1 as well, for today. Thanks again for your interest and see you next time.. Operator. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You. may disconnect.",20200506_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Earnings_Call_2020-5-6_DN000000002833326951.pdf,2020-05-06
36,"Hello. Good morning, to the Hannover Re's Investors Day. I wish you a very warm welcome. on behalf of the entire management team. Again this is a virtual format because of the. pandemic. So we are not broadcasting from Copenhagen as originally planned. We are in. Hanover. I'm happy that so many of you are already participating. This Investor Day is our. 24th edition, and therefore, a long-standing tradition of Hannover Re. And as everybody is. talking about purpose, the purpose of this event is very clear.. First of all, we want to provide additional information, we want to demonstrate. transparency, and we want to also advance the dialogue with you. We want to increase. the understanding of our business the market development and also our positioning in. our future prospects. As this may take a while, we have scheduled for the next four hours.. For an event to be viewed as helpful, in particular from your side, it needs a number of. ingredients. It's just when I teamed up with my 12 years old daughter last week to bake a. pie, you need to have a delicious and appealing recipe, a proper time frame and a good. allocation of resources.. But most important, you need to have the right ingredients, the basics, but also the herbs,. the spices and sugar, of course. I do realize that this analogy has some limitations. because it's a lot easier to make a pie. Nonetheless, I hope we have some delicious. thought -- a delicious food for thought for you. Just a few words on today's agenda.. Our CEO, Jean-Jacques Henchoz, will kick things off and bring you up to speed with. regards to our strategy and the achievements we have so far reached in order to have a. sustainable outperformance. Our CFO will then go over the investment strategy in detail,. and he will also give us some thoughts on inflation. As always, we will then invite Sven and. Claude to share their thoughts on the Non-Life and the Life & Health reinsurance business.. So we have a rich agenda and a rich variety in our agenda for today.. Just a few organizational remarks before we start. Today's event will be recorded. After. each presentation, we have some time for Q&A. (Operator Instructions) So it's now my. pleasure to hand over to our CEO, Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Jean-Jacques, the floor is. yours.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. A warm welcome to our Investor Day.. We wanted to have a meeting with physical presence, but given the uncertainties. surrounding the restrictions on the Covid pandemic, we decided to play safe and go for a. virtual event. I very much hope that next year will be an opportunity to meet in person, this. will be certainly behind us and the possibility to meet an exchange also informally during. breaks as well will be provided.. So I'd like to give a bit of an overview on where we stand as a company and also highlight. the execution of our strategy. You see my title is Teaming Up to Create Opportunities.. This is taken from our purpose statement, very much driven to partnerships with our. clients, with our broker partners, but also opportunities because we have a positive. outlook and see future opportunities arising and that's very much the key message we. want to convey for today.. So the agenda are a few comments first on our current position in the reinsurance market.. I'll then update you on the strategy cycle, which is a 3-year cycle, which started in '21. Then. I'd like to comment also on our ESG strategy, which is progressing very well. You might. have first seen the announcement yesterday on our net zero targets. Then a few words. on the outlook before closing and opening up for Q&A.. So on our position in the market, I don't want to go back too much into the previous. strategy cycle, but one overview on the key metrics showing that in spite of a quite. turbulent time with heavy NatCat activities in '18/'19 and, of course the Covid pandemic in. 2020, the main metrics are looking good. We delivered on most of them and showed, I. would say resilience in a very, very challenging environment. So looking back, we feel that. the main objectives we've set ourselves for the previous strategy cycle were met. We're. quite happy to see that there has been value creation for our shareholders. It's good, of. course to see the ROE performance in this challenging time and particularly also the. growth trajectory in all our business segments, particularly P&C in the past few years. So. good successful execution of the previous strategy cycle.. Looking at the performance in terms of return of equity, of course it's always good to. have a bit of a longer-term view. You see that Hannover Re produced above 13% ROE. over the past decade. This is, of course the platform for us to continue the trajectory. The. ROE performance has been quite above the industry average, 5.6%, in this period. You. see that we had some different cycles. And across these cycles, we managed to have this. outperformance. This is something which is key to the management team. We believe. that the ingredients which are helping this outperformance include the underwriting focus,. the underwriting DNA of Hannover Re and the discipline related to it, but also the. combination with the nurturing of partnerships with our clients, with brokers. We're trying. to be a very consistent player looking at long-term partnerships and trying to produce. win-win opportunities across the different cycles.. The capital management side is, of course also very important, particularly the. retrocession program, which is key to our strategy in P&C. This is something we will. continue to build on. Obviously in the past few years, it has helped the performance, but. we also want across the cycle to be able to make money for our retrocession partners.. This is also about partnerships on this side.. And last but not least, the lean operating model has helped producing an extra margin. over time and is a key part of our business model for how we want to operate going. forward. So just to look back, and that's really our reference point and something we want. to continue to build on going forward.. And a few words on our lean operating model. You see here on the left-hand side of the. slide, the development of net earned premiums. They quadrupled over the period since. 2000, so quite a growth trajectory. At the same time, looking at our admin expenses,. they increased by a factor of 2.8 during the same period. So you're looking at a model. which is very cost conscious and we're trying to build the franchise by making sure that. cost efficiency is continuously looked after. It's evident from the expense ratio, admin. expense ratio development, we're, on average, looking the at past five years about 3%. above the industry average. So quite a performance. It shows, in my view, the scalability of. the business model. It shows also that we continue to focus on operational efficiency, and. this is something which is key to the discussions in our Executive Board.. So the lean operating model is difficult to replicate. In my view, this is a key competitive. advantage, which is cultural, but also organizational. We seek organizational simplicity. I. think it's very difficult to copy such a model and we will keep it as a key ingredients for. future performance.. So just a look at the Covid situation. You know most of the numbers, but I just wanted to. give an overview on where we stand. In P&C, you remember that as of the end of 2020,. we had an overall expected load of EUR 950 million net. This was a situation, which kept. stable over the past few months. I can confirm today that we believe this is quite a. realistic picture of our expected exposure. Of course there are still some uncertainties on. potential long-tail exposures related to Covid. But at the same time, I think we have some. solid provision for it. So in my view, a stable situation. I would not expect movement on the. P&C side.. Life & Health is, of course a bit of a different story. The excess mortality has been felt in. our book of business from the beginning of the pandemic. The excess mortality is most. pronounced in the United States and continues to have a burden on our numbers for. 2021. There is also some excess mortality, unfortunately, in South Africa, which is a country. which has been very much impacted by Covid, particularly because of the lack of progress. in vaccination programs. In Latin America, the same. So me Latin American countries. where quite impacted. I think that with the progress made with the vaccination levels. across the world, we'll see some improvement to the situation in 2022. But it's clear that. the Covid pandemic has had a clear impact not only on 2020, but also on our. performance in 2021.. What you know also in Life & Health is that we have a pandemic retrocession program,. which is a parametric cover focusing on the U.S., the U.K. and the Australian market. This. would potentially give us a protection for further degradation of the situation, particularly. in the United States. This is something which will be felt rather in 2022. If we have some. relief from an accounting point of view, you would see that reflected in our numbers for. '22.. And to end up on the global picture, I think as I mentioned earlier, I think we see a lot of. opportunities in the market. The global reinsurance market has been growing quite. steadily, 7.3% in the past five years. Hannover Re has been growing faster than that.. We've seen some good opportunities. We have been able to expand a lot of client. relationships. We're able to profitably grow during this period. I believe we're well. positioned to continue on this path. There are many clients who want to offer us more. space in their insurance program. I think we're also a partner for the broker community. and receive a lot of opportunities, traditional business but also nontraditional business. opportunities. So the outlook is, in our view, good.. And of course you have a huge protection gap. This is, of course for the industry a big. challenge, seeing that the delta between economic losses and effective insured losses. remains very high, but we can see this as an opportunity to reduce the protection gap. going forward. We need to make some progress on modeling. We need to look into. insurance penetration and increase it, particularly in emerging markets. But I think beyond. the natural growth of the reinsurance market. There are also opportunities to expand the. cake, if I may put it that way by tapping into the protection gap. I would say the protection. gaps, plural, because beyond NatCat, there are also many opportunities to grow further. in reinsurance. Therefore, this confirms our view that a pure-play reinsurance positioning is. an appropriate way to tap into these opportunities.. So let me now move to a quick update on our strategy cycle, which we started in 2021.. You see here the strategy map of the group on the left-hand side, the foundations as we. put it, first of all, culturally, our purpose statement, our values. We have a very strong. culture at Hannover Re, which we want to nurture and a very strong governance. framework in place. This is very much the building block to ensure sound growth and. cohesive strategy and organization, which is a high-performance organization.. We have performance drivers, and I will comment on them in a minute. These are the. drivers for growth, and we have performance enablers. I spoke about some of them. earlier on, and I see them as the drivers for potential outperformance. That's very much. our framework and where we want to operate in the future with the priorities set and a. few strategic initiatives, which I want to comment on, first, around the performance drivers. and performance enablers. Then I'll briefly comment on our ESG strategy, which is part of. the foundations.. So let me start with Asia Pacific. We have set ourselves very ambitious goals in the region.. We've been very successful. We've gained market share profitably in the past. But so a. couple of years ago that there was more to be done and identified a number of. initiatives, which we pursue with allocated resources and expect to have additional EBIT. contributions from these initiatives. So you see the key numbers, the expected numbers. with over EUR 0.5 billion of EBIT to be expected within the strategy cycle.. We follow, of course demographic development. The exposures are gaining importance,. economic development. And clearly, the share of wallet you have, even if you don't grow. in terms of percentage, you see the trajectory of our main clients. They are growing very. fast and need our help. We are on track with our financial targets at this stage. So the goal. we're setting ourselves for Asia Pacific is in my view still a realistic stretch, but realistic. target. And as you see, we focus on EBIT generation. We don't look at premium. This is. not where we're heading. The underwriters in the region know that this is about bottom. line. Meaning, if the cycle is not conducive to further growth in any one year, we accept it. and make sure that our long-term trajectory is front of mind and not a situation one year. or the other.. So we accept that growth might not be always within expectations if margins are under. threat, which is not the case today. We're growing steadily. We are very successful in the. area of financial solutions in Life & Health. We see the growing middle class with emerging. needs and the insurance penetration increasing. We see regulatory developments which. are triggering interest for nontraditional solutions. The growth outlook is for us, at this. stage, in terms of premium in Life & Health at about 11% in P&C. So these are the numbers. built in. I believe that with the strengthening of our regional hubs in the region and the. recruitment phase we're in, will have what it takes to be successful and outperform in Asia. Pacific. So good path and promising development in the region. We'll see a bit more in the. Q&A probably and when we discuss the business unit strategies later on today.. The second initiative, which is important to us and is also a long-term endeavor is our. efforts to leverage innovation and also digital solutions. We have put in place a number of. accelerators within the business units and want to make sure that emerging ideas are. consistently leveraged, that we develop new solutions with our partners. We feel whereas. this is not, from an EBIT production standpoint, very, very prominent today we are. convinced that in a few years, this will be a material part of what we do.. Two main themes we want to focus on. The first is digital health data. We feel in the. health sector, there is a real revolution taking place. There's a potential for strengthening. of partnerships with our clients looking into health data and making sure that we. contribute to an improved connection with our clients, increase profitability, but also. positive contribution to healthcare by creating more awareness among policyholders. An. example of what we're doing is VeoSense collaboration in the area of wearables, which is. a very interesting opportunity for us to make steady progress in the digital health space.. So more to come, still in the making, but we're quite confident that this will be an. important part of what we do and data analytics being one of the key skills we need to. combine with our underwriting abilities.. The second theme is related to direct digital distribution. Of course many of our. traditional clients are looking for an entry into the direct space, digital solutions, products. and new entrants are coming into the insurance space, fintech companies with original. and distinctive strategies. What we're trying to do in that space, again in a pure play of. reinsurance positioning, we want to partner with these different clients and potential. clients and provide a new value proposition through the digital channel. We see a lot of. promising opportunities. One example mentioned here is Parametrix, a cloud insurance. scheme, which we developed with Element in Germany, the insurance provider. This is a. good example of something which we can develop in partnerships, providing a lot of. knowledge in pricing, structuring, product development and modeling, of course as a key. asset to the contribution to this partnership.. So here is an area which is of long-term strategic importance. It's not going to move the. needle in terms of pure EBIT contribution in the short term, but I think there is a lot of. potential opportunities coming up. Scalability is the goal, and I hope in a few years, I'll be. able to provide examples with scale in the sense of creating new partnerships for. innovation. Client excellence is the other initiatives we're pursuing. If you look at the. feedback from clients, from brokers, you might conclude that we don't need to push too. much on this because we received extremely positive feedback because exactly of this. partnership approach we're showing. But at the same time, we're growing steadily. Our. clients are growing. Some of them are consolidating and more demanding, sometimes. more complex to handle.. And we are of the view that we need to prepare for future growth. One aspect is to. ensure a very strong key account management when it comes to the international clients,. the larger clients and be one voice to our customers, orchestrate the relationship. And. another priority is to improve on our customer relationship management. We have a new. platform for collaboration across the teams, and we want to enrich the client discussion.. So short term, of course we see a lot of inbuilt growth in the traditional business. It's not a. growth challenge, but it's about preparing for future growth. So I think that strengthening. of our client interactions and approach to client relationships will bear some fruit in the. midterm. It's an investment which is necessary to continue growth beyond this strategy. cycle.. As an example, and I won't comment in depth on this, you see the latest feedback. We. gathered the NMG global studies, a survey which is done worldwide in Life & Health and in. P&C. Of course we look into the feedback in detail. You see the brand associations like. partnership, innovation, flexibility, supportive, the consistency, the reliability, which are. attributes we like to hear. This is what we hear from our clients. We are very much number. one in a number of indicators in the capability index. These are, to a great extent, the. attributes we want to see to secure further growth. The broker community puts us in a. number one position in P&C. So this is very good to see. So a strong platform for. customer loyalty and something we want to continue to nurture going forward. So clientcentricity, client excellence as a long-term endeavor, building on what is essentially a. strength of the Hannover Re model.. Last but not least, talent management. I commented already last year on it. The number. of activities are not totally surprising, but it is important in the context of our growth story.. We've been growing steadily. We need to hire new people. The APAC initiative, in. particular, shows the need to grow regionally. It's important that we foster a strong culture. as we grow that we integrate our new hires, make sure that our culture is alive and that. our new talent create added value, but also longevity in the company. You know that a. number of our underwriters are very experienced, have a long tenure, a lot of loyalty with. the company. Succession planning is certainly one of the topics we want to strengthen. over time. There will be a number of key roles to replace in the next few years. So we're. putting a lot of emphasis on personal development, on leadership development. creating. opportunities to be a bit more mobile and allowing also our younger talents to broaden. their profiles. So a lot of activities around talent management, talent development in a. growing organization and certainly the goal to continue to foster a very strong culture and. make sure the Hannover Re way is -- continues to be alive.. So let me end up with the last topic on our strategy map, which is ESG. We are of the view. that there is a lot on our plate, but we also did a lot in the past few years, and I want to. comment on this. Of course it has gained unprecedented global awareness in the last few. years. I think the Covid pandemic, to some extent, has indirectly highlighted the need to. do more with respect to climate change in particular. There are a lot of initiatives. There's. a lot of activity going on.. The COP26 conference is going to take place in Glasgow. We decided to really make an. effort to not only continue on our path and be diligent in that space, but also be a bit. more vocal and say more about our priorities. We want to increase the dialogue. We want. to increase transparency. We want ESG to be well anchored into our corporate strategy.. So climate change is a key topic, first, of course in the contribution to mitigation. strategies. But also in the area of climate change adaptation, I think there's a lot of things. we need to do to adapt to climate change, to prevent natural disasters to be too. destructive and so on and so forth. So a priority for us. You might have seen our. sustainability report giving you an overview on where we stand with this alliance, which is. very beneficial to our strategy as well. And hopefully, we'll set some standards for the. industry going forward.. So these are our commitments. I won't go into the details, but I think this is for your. background and our sustainability report is also giving you a lot of information on our. target, on the priorities. I think in asset management, we have an opportunity to improve. quite steadily in the next few years. It's about asset selection, but we also feel we can do. more in new technologies, in renewable energy, in infrastructure. In underwriting, a lot of. progress made. In our facultative operation, as I mentioned, we decided to progressively. exit the thermal coal segment in facultative. We're also shying away from the most. extractive projects, particularly oil sands, and are very diligent in improving our track. record in underwriting.. The next stage will be treaty. It is, of course a bit of more of a challenge for us because. the level of granularity of data is not as significant, and this is why we want to work with. our peers in order to make progress there. In our own business operations, we're carbonneutral in Hanover. It has been the case for a number of years. This is, of course a. combination of carbon offset. But we also hope to focus on being more efficient, travel. whenever we can use options which are more sustainable. We want to globalize this in the. next few years. And by 2030, we want to be a net zero organization across the globe. So. a lot to do there, but I think worthwhile targets to set ourselves and clearly with climate. change, the topic of our generation.. You see that we have strengthened our approach and visibility. This is reflected in some. of the specialized ratings. We've been progressing very steadily with ESG ratings. You see. a few mentioned here and want to continue to progress. We're also very pleased to see. that our company is listed in some of the specialized ESG listings. The DAX 50 ESG index,. in particular, is an important one. So we want to continue on our path. I hope in the coming. years that we'll have more examples of such specialized listings or ratings improvement. on ESG. But it's a good indicator, which reflects the progress made by our company.. So I conclude on ESG. I want to look into the outlook for 2022. The target matrix, which. you see here, is unchanged. We feel that in spite of the continuing challenges, Covid, of. course continuing to be a highly relevant point for 2021. NatCat activities, we feel that our. 3-year target matrix is robust and feel there's no need to revise it. So this is our platform,. our indicator for future success, and we'll be guided by these metrics going forward.. That's the strategy cycle '21, '23.. And apart from that, what we want to do is continue to emphasize the importance of our. dividend story. We changed the emphasis. We want to discontinue the payout ratio, which. we've used in the past and move to a new definition of our target for the ordinary. dividend. And from now on, our goal is to at least secure the same level of ordinary. dividend as compared to the previous year. So you know that our last dividend has been. at 4 50 and this is our base for future payment.. The special dividend, however stays as an option, which is related to our performance in. the year, our capital requirements and our capital needs for further growth. So we didn't. change the messaging here. But of course -- and as soon as we can, depending on the. performance, we are of the view that we should offer a special dividend. But the. emphasis, the message is on dividend continuity and a strong signal that we want to at. least match the ordinary dividend performance we've shown in the previous year going. forward.. So key takeaways for this initial part. I think first of all, we have very good growth outlook.. We see many opportunities, but we want to support this growth through initiatives, which. give us some structure and longevity around growth, so Asia Pacific innovation, (inaudible). client excellence, talent management, really building on our success story, but also giving. us the toolkit, the structure, the basis for sustainable growth. We're well on track in this. initial year. This is good news. ESG is an area where we're working very hard. We're. making progress across our operations and see the steady improvements in our ratings. as an indicator of success. But we'll continue to work on this based on our guidance for. net zero, our targets for net zero going forward.. And lastly, the capital management side remains key to success. We want to convey the. message of dividend continuity, and therefore, emphasize the stability and improvement. of our ordinary dividend going forward. So I close with these key takeaways, and we have. 25 minutes approximately for Q&A. My colleagues will join me now, Clemens, Sven and. Claude, for any questions you might have on this first section. Thank you very much.. Questions And Answers. Well thank you, Jean-Jacques, for your lively presentation. I'm sure that has already. stimulated a lot of interest. Therefore, we are going straight into the Q&A session.. (Operator Instructions) For the Q&A session, I'd like to invite all Board members giving. presentations today to take the stage.. First, I'm pleased to welcome Sven Althoff, our coordinator for the P&C business and with. responsibility for the U.S., U.K., Ireland, London market and some specialty markets like. marine, aviation, credit surety and, of course facultative business. I'm also happy to. welcome Claude Chevre. Claude's responsibility on the Life & Health side covers. longevity business and most regional markets except for the Anglo-Saxon markets. I'm. also pleased to welcome Clemens Jungsthofel, our CFO, whose scope of responsibility. includes, among other things, IT investments and finance and accounting.. So I think we are set to take your questions. I already see a number of raised hands, and. we start with Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. So Andrew, can you hear us? We cannot. hear your question.. Andrew James Ritchie. Sorry, I think your operator is being quite unhelpful just in terms of interfering with muting. and unmuting. A couple of questions. I'm not sure, when I add together the various. initiatives that have been outlined, I'm not -- you talked about incremental EBIT adding up. to about EUR 300 million by 2023. I'm not sure how I view it as incremental because -- or. to what degree is business as usual, and you're just unpacking what would otherwise be. business as usual. I mean if I add it together, it implies about a 6% growth in EBIT from. those initiatives on average over three years. Is that on top of normal organic growth? Or. just help us understand what's going truly incremental, I guess is the question.. On the capital management, I'm still a bit confused why change the messaging now? Or. are you not really changing the messaging? This is simply a formality of what we've always. seen, which is a fair degree of continuity in the ordinary dividend and specials from time. to time. I can't judge to what degree is really a change of message or not.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Well thank you, Andrew. On your first question, I think when we discussed the different. areas of focus for the next few years, we felt they would need to be associated with. additional resources, and we wanted to have a clear price tag on these resources and the. return expectations. Some of it -- and it will be very difficult to really measure in practice. what comes out of our core business, what is the result of initiatives. But based on the. initial planning we had at the time, we felt we should put an additional EBIT contribution.. Some of it will translate into incremental growth. Some of it will be an expansion of our. business with clients. Some of it will be in nontraditional business. But it's not on top of. what we've presented today and will be a bit of a blend going forward. This was more of. an ambition we wanted to set to the teams and this added to our planning for the next. three years. So it's not on top of what you've seen so far.. On the capital message, my colleague might complement. But we wanted, indeed, as you. said, to make more explicit what has been implicit in the past few years. That message is. not a change of direction. This is more of an explicit emphasis, which we want to convey. to the market. So no big revolution I'm aware, but I think making sure that the emphasis is. explicitly communicated to the market.. I think or I hope, Andrew, that answers your question. So we continue with Will Hardcastle. with the next question.. William Fraser Hardcastle. It's a quick one on retro really. I think it does fit in here just thinking about the capital. management structure. It's been a key differential versus peers in respect of volatility. It's. clear in P&C. It could be coming apparent in Life & Health as well those kinds of things. So. it makes the question as to what prevents peers from replicating this approach? Do you. think it's cultural or is it a structural decision? And given you've drawn down a bit on retro. in recent years, is it possible, do you think to expect price change at upcoming renewals. on your retro to be better than the market price change like it's been recently given your. long-standing relationships?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Will. So I'll give the question to Sven, who is very much into our retro approach.. Sven Althoff. Thanks for the question. As you know, we have a long-term approach to buying retro. To. your question, why is that not easily replicated? I think it can be replicated, but it's a. question of how much appetite for volatility do you have from, particularly, your NatCat. writings. And here, our appetite seems to be lower compared to the average peer. And. hence, we have continued building on the capacity we are buying on the retrocessional. side. You know that we are very diversified by having various instruments of retro. So we. are, therefore, also flexible to structure our protection according to our needs for future. years. Whether we have to expect price increases at the renewal over and above what. we can achieve in the reinsurance market ourselves, it's a little too early to say. I mean you. will not be surprised that on, at least some of the losses, our retro program is working. again this year. So we certainly have to expect increases in prices and/or adjustments and. structure. But whether this will be over and above or in line or below what we can achieve. in the market ourselves, it's too early to tell. I would expect it to be in line again.. Well thank you Will for your question. So the next question is from Vinit Mahotra from. Mediobanca.. Can you hear me?. Yes. We can hear you.. So my question links more to -- I mean yesterday there was this -- two days ago, there. was this ESG press release where you commented that on the investment management. side, there'll be a 30% reduction in carbon exposure by 2025. Now usually, the ESG. targets tend to have a profile further out that we don't know I mean you don't have to. care lightweight. But this one would be something that brings more action from your side.. So I'm just wondering whether there is whether some kind of market you're flagging. because you'll be selling the lot? Or how do you think the actual practical application of. this could mean? Then I have one question from the CFO. There will be Q&A session. afterwards, so I can (inaudible). Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Vinit. I give the floor to Clemens on investment management.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you for the question, Vinit. I will be covering some of that later in my session as. well. But just briefly, on ESG and Investment Management. As you mentioned, we've sort. of raised the bar, on the one hand, formulating a target for reduction of carbon-intense. investments. We've raised about to 30% by 2025. So we've increased our ambition early. in the year there. That was part of our sustainability strategy. That will cover roughly 39%. of our portfolio. It's mainly addressed to corporate bonds and equity positions. So we will. be actively screening those and we'll be reallocating some parts of that. On top of that,. that was what we communicated yesterday we have set a net zero target by 2050 in that. area.. Well thank you, Vinit. Of course you can ask further questions in later sessions as well. The. next question is from Iain Pearce.. Sven Althoff. I had three questions, if that's okay. The first one was just on Covid-related losses. You. mentioned that you have a decent proportion of losses related to sort of liability claims,. longer-term claims. Have you've seen anything there developing yet? Is there anything. worth dragging? And also, with the high level of IBNR you still have on the business. interruption claims and as these get notified and you start coming against the retro, is. there a chance that we actually see cover losses going down going forward and reserve. releases in relation to those?. My second question was on ESG. We've had some peers talking about growth. opportunities related to ESG, particularly on the underwriting side. I think if you could. provide some thoughts there, sort of where you might see growth opportunities related. to ESG, that would be quite interesting.. Then on the dividend, just thinking related to this change in dividend policy. Obviously you. had quite a big jump in the ordinary last year. How we should think about the ordinary. dividend trajectory going forward and what that should be linked to in terms of growth of. the ordinary?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you. So Sven, maybe I'll invite you to comment on the first two questions and. Clemens on the dividend.. Sven Althoff. Yes. Very happy to do so. So on the Covid side, you're right that a fair number of our. IBNRs are on liabilities and other long-tail exposures like credit and surety. We are. comfortable with our reserve position right now. We have not seen a lot of movement in. Q2, nor will we see a lot of movement in Q3. So we start in certain parts of the reserve.. We start recognizing some first prudency in our numbers. But it's still very early days when. it comes to exposures like credit and surety. You know that we have more than EUR 200. million of our reserve coming from those lines of business. Yes. We have not seen the. level of insolvencies rising in the last 18 months. But that, of course was heavily supported. by government support for either the economies or for the credit insurance industry. As. those are phasing out, we have to expect insolvency levels getting back to normal or. above normal. So what we are comfortable with the reserve position, we would feel it's. too early to start releasing some of that. So from that point of view, you can expect that,. that number should stay stable throughout 2021.. Your second question was on growth opportunities on the ESG side, and there are plenty,. but maybe I'll give you two examples of where we see growth opportunities. First is in the. sector of renewable energy. So wind, solar and other means of alternative energy. generation, where, of course you need insurance for operating those wind farms or solar. parks. So that's an area of new business opportunities.. And the second example I can give is the phenomenal amount of investment that is. necessary to get into the -- in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement or the EU Green. deal. We are talking very, very large numbers of investments that are required in order to. transform the entire industry to be carbon neutral. And all of that activity, of course needs. insurance during the construction phase and then in the operating phase. So this should. definitely be a significant source of government and commercial investment and hence,. insurance opportunities.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Clemens?. Clemens Jungsthof el. On the dividend, I think it's been said earlier, I think when you look at how a dividend. policy was sort of phrased was very much linked to a payout ratio when we look at the. ordinary. Then we, of course had a special dividend sort of as an option in terms of capital. management. The reason why we really wanted to strengthen the message here is that. when you look into the past, how we've been doing about dividends is really -- was rather. that commitment to steady and growing dividends. This is what we really wanted to. reassure the market. We have raised the bar a bit here. So the five 50 that Jean-Jacques. mentioned earlier is sort of the starting point for us. Of course we are committed and. wanted to state that, of course to grow that base with our EBIT.. Okay. Thank you very much, Iain, for your questions. The next one is coming from Thomas. Fossard from HSBC.. Yes. Hope you can hear me well. I had a question related to your NatCat writing. Can you. remind us what's your appetite? How much allocated capital is currently to write NatCats,. how you intend to grow this into 2022 and maybe be a bit more specific by regions? I. think that in the past, you say that actually for U.S. CAT probably wind, you were already. maxed out. But just wanted to understand if potential price increase, with potential price. increase on the horizon, this may change your risk appetite and how you will allocate. potentially more capital to this line of business? And maybe I fully understand that you're. presenting and leaving unchanged your 2021, 2023 targets in terms of growth. expectations, plus 5%. But it seems to be that the sector is heading into a kind of a quite. nice cyclical upturn. So I wanted to better understand how you wanted to take benefit of. the (inaudible) turn? And potentially, if you could be a bit more specific and precise on. what you're expecting in terms of growth rate on the P&C market for next year?. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Thomas. Sven, maybe I'll invite you NatCat.. Sven Althoff. Thank you, Thomas. On your letter question, I would ask for your patience. I will cover our. midterm outlook on the P&C side when it comes to premium growth in my presentation.. So hopefully, that will give you a good idea where we are. -- But of course also happy to. take a further Q&A after my presentation if you should have any questions.. When it comes to the NatCat risk appetite, our risk appetite has been very stable the last. five years, I would say. We have grown our NatCat writings proportionate to the growth of. our economic capital. But the percentage of economic capital we are using for NatCat. writing itself has been stable. We, you're right, have certain areas, and particularly U.S.. wind exposed business, where we have deemphasized our growth. So 2021 is the third. year in a row where we are growing our U.S. wind aggregates much less than. proportionate to the overall growth of our NatCat risk appetite. The reason is. diversification. U.S. wind for us and for the entire industry, of course is the peak peril, and. that is also showing through in our portfolio. But we decided three years ago that we want. to close the gap between U.S. wind and the other peak perils we are looking yet. In order. to do -- come to that result, we decided to lessen proportionately grow in U.S. wind. That. will remain unchanged going into next year.. Yes. You're right. We feel that we are in a good pricing environment and that good pricing. environment should continue into 2022. But we are not expecting a pricing environment. that would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite on the NatCat side.. Jean-Jacques Henchoz. Thank you, Sven. Clemens, maybe I invite you to briefly comment on the target matrix.. Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. On the growth, Thomas, I think it's -- you have to read it as an ambition over the. cycle. That's how we looked at the target metrics in terms of P&C growth. I think the. overall growth with the 5% is probably a bit more allocated to P&C. I guess it's a balanced. message there. The first one being we do see opportunities in the market over the cycle,. and we want to take advantage of those. But at the same time, we wanted to convey the. measures that we are not really chasing top line. So we are -- we don't want to sacrifice. bottom line in terms of really chasing top line in the upcoming renewals. However you've. seen that our growth has been in excess of what we've put in the target matrix. So we will. revisit that number for 2022, of course again and will include that in our guidance for 2022. as well.. Well thank you, Thomas, for your question. It looks like we have no further requests for. questions. Therefore, move on with our agenda. So thank you for your excellent. questions, and thank you for taking the stage for answering the questions.. We are not at the next coffee break, but I'm sure you're desperate for a coffee break. But. as some of you have doubtlessly learned in economics, foregoing consumption, as long. as you have saved it instead is, or should I say used to be rewarded with interest. This. brings us straight to the next topic. Our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel will give an update on. the investment portfolio and the future income it can be expected to generate. He will. also talk about inflation and in particular, how we protect ourselves in multiple ways and. not only on the investment side. I'm sure you will find this thrillingly interesting. But just as a. housekeeping remark, information about our reserving position has already been. published with our Q2 numbers. Therefore, it is not part of this part of this section. On. that note, I'd like to welcome Clemens on stage. Clemens, it's your turn.. (presentation). Clemens Jungsthof el. Yes. Thank you, Karl. So -- thrilling, you said, Karl. I'm still wondering really what got into me. to put inflation on the agenda today. I think it must have been your team. You probably. talked me into this for good reasons though, I have to say because inflation is really. something that is in literally in every second headline at the moment in the newspapers.. So it's all over the place. And at the same time, interestingly, it's a bit of an elephant in the. room topic inflation when we talk about our and industry how the reinsurance industry is. affected. So I think it's really worthwhile to spend some time on that topic.. But let's start with investments and how we are doing there. So I think it's fair to say on. the investment side that our portfolio has fared quite well over the pandemic. It has. produced very stable returns. I think it has shown strong resilience over the last year, and. it has also produced very strong and attractive returns in 2021 so far. So overall, I think. we're doing quite well there. That is the despite fact that we are in a market that I would. still call quite challenging.. So you know this slide already. It's familiar to you. It shows sort of the locked-in yields in. our fixed income portfolio. That's the light blue bars and the dotted line that you see. here. You know that from previous presentations. Our reinvestment yield, that represents. the green bar and the dotted line as per currency.. So you can see that our locked-in yield at the moment stands at 2.21%. So if you. remember the slide from last year, that came further down from 2.35%. I think we've. managed to smooth that a bit that drop. I would have expected a bit sharper drop given. the situation last year and early this year. But I think we've managed to smooth that a bit.. Then the reinvestment yield, you can see, has decreased further from 1.45%. In 2019, we. were standing at 1.57% to what is now 1.38%.. So reinvestment remains challenging for some time. The question is how do we position. ourselves in the market? And Karl mentioned it, so we have slightly adjusted our strategy,. our investment strategy early in the year. So those are the three pillars of our investment. strategy that you see here. So it's the credit portfolio, on the one hand side, the real. assets and ESG as a third becoming more pronounced pillar.. What changed from last year basically in our strategy? I think the first one is -- and you. remember that in 2020, we had rather take a passive derisking approach, particularly on. the side credit. So a bit more risk detached there on the credit side. We see that credits. have come to more expensive levels now with monetary politics, et cetera, pushing down. threats, so it's not an easy exercise. But what you see here, we have reallocated some. govies into BBB and high-yield corporate bonds. The focus there is on large and small. corporates in developed markets. So it's really about finding the buckets that still provide. attractive risk returns there.. On the CLO spectrum, I think that still provides some room for opportunities. It still offers. good spread returns there, but we really have to look into it, particularly to look at capital. costs there as well as very important when it comes to risk reward. So we reloaded some. 2A into our BBB bucket investments on the CLO side.. Emerging markets, as you can see here, we do have a substantial portfolio in emerging. markets. There are still market opportunities in the emerging market space. Still, rather. developed markets are very expensive. So same here, it's a rather opportunistic. approach there.. So I think that counts for the overall credits at the moment. So it's not easy to find a sweet. spot there. It's not easy to find opportunities here. I think you really have to go the extra. mile on the credit side here to find the sweet spots, to find opportunities there, or as one. of our investment managers recently said, it really feels like squeezing the last drop out of. a lemon. I think that describes it very well. But I think we've done -- during 2021, we've. done a quite good job here on the credit side and have positioned ourselves.. Then of course our real assets. The private equity portfolio there, as you know, it's a very. established asset class within our portfolio. It's roughly EUR 1.3 billion at the moment with. commitments, outstanding commitment on top of that. It's highly diversified. It has been a. very stable contributor even in 2020, a very stable contributor to our earnings and has. proven to be resilient in difficult times. We've reported that in the first and in the Second. Quarter, that it has been an uptick in terms of distributions from our private equity. portfolio. So that is very pleasing to see.. On the real estate side, it's roughly EUR 2.3 billion that we have there on the real estate. side, both direct and indirect funds, strong focus on the U.S., on Europe and then we've. got a substantial portfolio both in Asia and in Germany as well, roughly 45% to 50% office. space there, 15% to 20% logistics and retail, et cetera.. So I think on the fund side, we have a steady contribution to our real estate funds. On the. direct side, same here, you have to be really looking into opportunities in the market. You. have to be very disciplined. It's partly, in some regions, a very competitive market. So we. are very mindful of pricing there. So we are rather taking an opportunistic approach both. when it comes to a new investment, but also to disposals. But I'll come to that in a minute.. I think we've managed to keep that very stable as well.. On the infrastructure side, at the moment, roughly EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million. there, includes equity and also debt positions there. It's a focus at the moment, mainly on. the U.S., but we want to enhance that and distribute that to other areas as well. We are. looking steadily for opportunities there, part of our ESG strategy as well.. So how are we doing on all this? You can see the familiar table here with our asset. allocation. So you can see when you look at the at the bottom line that our asset base,. when you recall the number from last year has increased over the last 12 months by. roughly EUR 4 billion. So I think it's fair to say that the speed and the strong operating cash. flows that our underwriting colleagues were producing over the last 12 months has been. challenging for us on the investment side really to find spots there to invest that. But I. think again on the credit side, we've done quite well. The most notable change here you. can see in the reallocation of the government bonds to more corporate bonds here. But. we've also managed to grow our real assets, as you can see here, with the portfolio and. the equities as well. So I think that's -- the team has done a good job here.. On the right-hand side, the contributions. You know this table as well. You can see that. particularly on the private equity side, as mentioned earlier, which represents roughly 3%. of our overall portfolio, but contributes 16% to our ordinary as per June 2021. So again. very pleasing and very steady contributions there, and I see that for the rest of the year. as well.. So how does our corporate bond portfolio look like? We've grown it quite steadily, as you. can see here. Substantially, as part of our strategy, we've increased the BBB rating. investments here, as you can see, the positions. Overall, the quality of the portfolio is still. very, very strong. Our fixed income portfolio was 94% of our fixed income investments. carrying an investment grade.. Quick glance on the alternative investments. As mentioned earlier, it's a constantly. growing asset class. We slightly increased our targets here on the real assets that you can. see here on the left-hand side. Again private equity, as you can see here, on the IRRs has. been a strong earnings contributor. And even when you look back over the last 15, 20. years in our portfolio, has always been a very stable contributor. So we will be keeping. and actually building on that class going forward as well.. Real estate, again stable contributor as well. It wasn't easy, as mentioned earlier, to keep. that level of investment here because we've done some opportunistic sales. We had. some very good market opportunities. So we took chance and disposed some of our real. estates. We're able to replace that in terms of -- return is very stable as well, very much in. line with expectations. We do watch the areas where we had potential Covid impact. I. mentioned earlier, that roughly 45% to 50% is office space. But there, I think it's all around. how flexible you are in terms of office space. We have seen very rarely issues with that. I. think overall, the office space is very flexible. We do see customers, renters there to ask. for rebuilding in terms of new work, et cetera. So it's not about really decreasing space at. the moment, it's rather using it in a different way. That's what we see in our portfolio. But. we watch that very closely.. Again on infrastructure, constantly growing portfolio with debt and equity positions there.. On ESG, as announced yesterday and briefly touched base on it in the Q&A, it's actually -and you might think that as we have become probably a bit more vocal on ESG in asset. management. I did look it up when I was preparing for the session. We actually started the. ESG journey quite early actually, 10 years ago on the investment side with some exclusions. already in 2011. We've actually formulated an ESG strategy on the investment side already. in 2012. So the journey started early. At the heart of our client strategy on the investment. side is the decarbonization of our investment. Again the first target, 30% reduction in. carbon intensity of the asset classes, so corporate bonds, covered bonds and equities. So. starting point from that is 2019. We will be reducing by 30% -- to 30% by 2025. Then, of. course the attainment of climate neutrality in this area, as mentioned, by 2050. The goal. will accomplish by active portfolio management. Again that asset class is roughly 39%,. 40% at the moment. Another step forward is the increased emphasis on sustainable. investments that sort of counteract climate change, such as infrastructure investments. and impact invest funds.. So let's spend some time on inflation. As mentioned earlier, it's a topic that is literally in. every second headline. I do promise that I will not even make an attempt to try to predict. the unpredictable. So I will not talk about inflation itself. I would only share my thoughts on. how this might or might not impact Hannover Re. What are the implications on inflation?. Just briefly here, you can see the areas that can potentially be impacted by inflation -- It's. the obvious one, of course on the pricing side and on the reserving side. But also when. we define our large loss budget for the year, we incorporate or we take account of. inflation there as well, of course. Then on the investment side, both in terms of hedging,. but also in terms of how we invest real assets is certainly one topic. Then, of course admin. costs, et cetera, and the obvious ones as well, we can be affected by inflation there as. well.. On the pricing side, I think first of all, it's really important to state that when we talk about. general inflation that the drivers for claims inflation, so how that can affect our business,. how it can affect that our underwriting, that the drivers are very different from what we. see in the headlines. For example, U.S. CPI as an inflation index for the U.S., so those. drivers behind that are very different. If we were to sort of form in Hannover Re-specific. inflation index, that would be a blend across regions, across currencies. Then, of course. we would have to distinguish between certain lines of business and the drivers, what. drives inflation in our LOBs. That is, for example, drivers would be wages and salaries in. our casualty lines of business, in our long-tail casualty LOBs, then rebuilding costs of. course in property, including NatCat and then medical expenses, for example, in the Life. & Health space.. So what are we doing about it? On the underwriting side, the obvious one, of course is. repricing as part of our regular annual renewal in the short-term business. So the best. estimate inflation assumptions are annually adjusted here on the underwriting side. We. incorporate historical experience, of course inflation in those assumptions, but also would. add some loadings and will add future outlooks into our pricing considerations there as. well. For 2021, we already raised slightly our assumptions here on inflation on top of what. we've seen in the past because you could see some dynamics, of course early in the year. already in terms of inflation. But we will be revisiting and see if there are any future trends,. of course when we do adjustments for 2022. So those are under review at the moment. as part of our regular renewal cycle here. Of course given the shortage of material, et. cetera, all what we see in the headlines, what we see in the indices, et cetera, will be. taken into account.. What are other mitigating facts here other than repricing? I think it's important to note that. on top of that, we have index clauses in large parts of our portfolio, particularly in our. portfolio outside the U.S., where it's not very common. But particularly in Europe, it's very. common that you have index clauses. Then we have sliding scales and profit commissions. in many of our P&C reinsurance contracts as well.. So on the pricing side, as you can see, I think it's sort of a basket of mitigating factors. here that mitigate that exposure. How does that look on the reserving side? First of all,. reserving is, of course very much based on with the actual methods that we use, very. much based on historical data. So anything that we would have seen in the past in terms. of inflation is explicitly or implicitly actually in the triangles that we use for actual. calculations going forward. So as long as inflation doesn't really change significantly,. average inflation would be -- would already be included in our reserves. I guess. historically, should be around 2% to 3% that we see as implicit inflation anyways. Then, of. course we consider when we do our actuary work at year-end, we always look at loadings. for deviations of what we've seen in the past in our triangles.. Another element is, of course the prudency in our reserving. You know that -- and we've. published our studies there. You know that we are carrying a substantial amount of buffers. in our reserves. Some of that the result, of course that particularly in the first underwriting. years, we set our ULRs above our pricing expectations. So that adds some prudency. there. Then, of course when you look at historic events, et cetera, I think it's fair to say. that within the last 20, 30 years, we haven't really observed significant impact of changes. in inflation on our technical provisions. So I think overall, I think the conservative reserve. buffers do add some comfort here. And also, I think when you look at our large loss. budgeting, we have been rather on the conservative side over the last 10 years. Of. course we have exceeded the large loss budget in the last five years. But when you really. look at long term, I think we've been rather on the conservative side here. So that adds. some buffer here as well.. On the hedging. So you do know our inflation-linked bonds. We've been reporting those.. So this is -- it's part of our, let's say inflation hedging program. We do have other. programs in place where we have hedging strategies in some jurisdictions, in some. currencies. But this is really sort of a substantial amount of inflation-linked bonds. What is. inflationary bond? Just briefly. It's basically a nominal bond where you have embedded an. inflation swap, which is linked to a consumer basket like CPI, et cetera, that we heard. earlier for each country. The portfolio is, at the moment, we slightly increased it in the First. Quarter. It stands at roughly EUR 5 billion. The duration is mainly sitting at six years and. nine years. You can see the exposure on the left-hand side. It's mainly euro and U.S. dollar.. So the -- when you look at the swap, how is the mechanic of the swaps? You have the. fixed (inaudible) that represents the expected inflation at purchase date and that is what. you can see on the left-hand side, so the average hedge inflation levels. Then you've got. the floating lag, that's the realized inflation until maturity of the inflation-linked bond, and. that's an exercise to do on a yearly basis. You see -- you compare sort of the fixed and. the floating lag. The accounting mechanics is that difference. So the actual inflation is part. of the amortization of the yearly amortization that comes with a time lag of two months. roughly. You will have seen that in our first and Second Quarter reporting that, that has. contributed already to our investment income. So that is how the mechanics are.. The swap doesn't happen. That's the reason why we structured it this way. The swap. doesn't have to be bifurcated under IFRS. So it's really a part of the market value change. that you do not see in the P&L, but in OCI in terms of volatility. It's -- again it's a bit easier. to handle.. So is it ideal? We've put down some sensitivities here. You can see that a change in. inflation of roughly 100 basis points would increase the market value of our inflation-linked. bonds to roughly EUR 470 million. When you look at our liability at our technical provisions,. of course that's not 100% coverage. That is clear. It would probably roughly at the. moment, stand at around 20% coverage of our liabilities. So if you do the same exercise. on our technical provisions, that would be probably bring in a sensitivity of around 4% in. our technical provisions roughly at the moment. So I think it's a proxy. It's not perfect, of. course because we do not hedge non-CPI, as mentioned earlier. There are different. drivers in our portfolio, of course. We have other mitigating factors here. So it's really part. of the overall inflation hedge strategy and adds another mitigating factor to it and works. quite well, of course at the moment.. So key takeaways. I think on the investments it's fair to say it's a highly diversified portfolio.. It's very, very resilient. We've adjusted our strategy slightly to, again to squeeze out that a. little bit out of the lemon to go the extra mile. It's really hard work there. I think this is really. where you have the advantage, you have to go the extra mile to find some opportunities. in the market and to smoothen out that drop in our book yield. I think we are doing quite a. good job there. I'm quite optimistic that we managed to smooth that out quite well.. Our ordinary income, that's very pleasing. And also when you look historically, I think if the. portfolio has been very reliable in terms of producing ordinary income. Overall, I think the. low interest rate environment, of course is challenging, but we will manage it. On the. inflation risk side, again I think it's over -- it's a mixed basket of certain mitigating factors.. Inflation drivers are monitored. We are monitoring them very closely. I think we have some",20211014_Hannover_Rueck_SE-_Shareholder_Mtg_Call_2021-10-14_SD000000002965861183.pdf,2021-10-14
